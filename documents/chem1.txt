Abstract

Computational prediction of reaction outcomes and optimum synthetic routes was a two-day meeting and workshop organised by the EPSRC Dial-a-molecule grand challenge network. Forty delegates discussed computer predictions of synthetic routes and reactions, and considered their relevance to contemporary chemistry.
