Abstract
Aim: An approach for Simultaneous estimation of rosuvastatin calcium and hydrochlorthiazide from bulk and commercial products using a validated reverse phase high performance liquid chromatographic technique. Materials and Methods: The separation of both the drugs was achieved on ACE C18 AR (AR - Aromatic) column (250 × 4.6 mm, 5 µm) column using a mobile phase of sodium perchlorate buffer solution (at pH 3.0): Acetonitrile (60:40 v/v). The flow rate was 1 ml/min and detection was done at 280 nm. Results: The retention time for Hydrochlorothiazide was 3.9 min and for Rosuvastatin calcium was 10.3 min. Rosuvastatin calcium and Hydrochlorothiazide showed a linear response in the concentration range of 5-30 µg/ml and 6.25-37.5 µg/ml respectively. The correlation co-efficients for Rosuvastatin calcium and Hydrochlorothiazide were 0.9998 and 0.9999 respectively. The percentage recoveries obtained for Rosuvastatin calcium and Hydrochlorothiazide range from 99.3% to 100.4% and 99.2% to 100.4% respectively. The results of analysis have been validated as per the International conference on Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines. Conclusion: Validation results indicated that the method shows satisfactory linearity, accuracy, precision, and ruggedness. The extremely low flow rate, simple mobile phase composition makes this method cost-effective, rapid, and non-tedious and can also be successfully employed for simultaneous estimation of both drugs in commercial products. Key Words: HPLC, hydrochlorothiazide, rosuvastatin calcium

INTRODUCTION
Rosuvastatin calcium [Figure 1] is chemically, bis [(E)7[4(4fluorophenyl)6isopropyl2[methyl (methylsulfonyl) amino] pyrimidin5yl] (3R, 5S)3,5dihydroxyhept6enoic acid] calcium salt. Rosuvastatin calcium is a statin drug used as HMG coenzyme A reductase inhibitor for controlling hyperlipidemic conditions. The literature survey reveals that Rosuvastatin calcium was analyzed by the spectrophotometric, HPTLC, and Reserve phase High performance liquid chromatography (RPHPLC) methods.[18] hydrochlorothiazide [Figure 2] is

chemically 6chloro1,1dioxo3,4dihydro2H1,2,4 benzothiadiazine7sulphonamide. It is used as a firstline calciumsparing thiazide diuretic drug that acts by inhibiting the kidneys' ability to retain water. This reduces the cardiac output and hence causes

Buffer Preparation
Accurately weighed 4.3 g sodium perchlorate was dissolved in to 1000 ml milliq water and 1 ml triethylamine was added to this buffer solution, then the pH was adjusted to 3.0 with orthophosphoric acid.

antihypertensive action. Literature survey reveals bioanalytical methods by Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LCMS) for detection of hydrochlorothiazide in human serum and blood, few spectrophotometric methods, and HPLC methods for the quantitative estimation of hydrochlorothiazide in bulk and pharmaceutical formulations.[916] Currently, most commonly prescribed medicines for cardiovascular diseases are statins and diuretics. The present drug combination has promising effect to control heart diseases. Literature review suggests no analytical methods were reported for simultaneous analysis in combined form and hence the following work was carried out.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (API) Reference standards of Rosuvastatin calcium and hydrochlorothiazide were received from Intas pharmaceuticals Ltd., Ahmedabad, Gujarat. RosuvaH Tablets were obtained from Zydus Cadila healthcare Ltd., Moraiya, Ahmedabad. Dose of Rosuvastatin calcium was 10 mg and hydrochlorothiazide was 12.5 mg in RosuvaH Tablets. Acetonitrile (HPLC Grade) used was purchased from Merck (India) Ltd., Mumbai. Orthophosphoric acid and sodium perchlorate were purchased from Spectrochem, India. RPHPLC was performed using shimadzu HPLC system Liquid Chromatography (LC) 2010HT, Shimadzu Corporation, Japan) equipped with quaternary pump, auto injector, column oven, and Photo diode array (PDA) detector.
Chromatographic Condition
Column: ACE C18 AR 4.6 × 250 mm, 5 µm. Detector: 280 nm. Injection volume: 10 µl. Flow rate: 1.0 ml/min. Temperature: 30°C. Run time: 12 min. Mobile phase: Sodium perchlorate Buffer (at pH 3.0): Acetonitrile (60:40). Diluent: Methanol.

Preparation of Standard Solution
Approximately 20 mg of Rosuvastatin calcium and 25 mg of hydrochlorothiazide reference standards were accurately weighed and transferred to a 100ml volumetric flask. The weighed sample was dissolved in diluent and sonicated for 10 min. The weighed sample was made up to volume with diluent to produce a standard stock solution. Aliquots from the standard stock solutions were appropriately diluted to 100 ml with diluent obtain final standard concentration of Rosuvastatin calcium (20 ppm) and hydrochlorothiazide (25 ppm) respectively.
Preparation of Test Solution
Twenty tablets were weighed accurately and finely powdered. Tablet powder equivalent to 20 mg of Rosuvastatin calcium and 25 mg of hydrochlorothiazide was transferred to a 100ml volumetric flask. A  few ml of diluent was added to above flask and the flask was sonicated for 30 min. The solution was made up to the mark with same diluent. Appropriate volume of aliquot was transferred to 100ml volumetric flask and volume was made up to the mark with diluent to obtain the final standard concentration of Rosuvastatin calcium (20 ppm) and hydrochlorothiazide (25 ppm). The test solution was filtered through 0.45µ PolyVinyliDene Fluoride Millipore Filter (PVDF) and analyzed by using HPLC.
Method Optimization
The detection wavelength of 280 nm was chosen in order to achieve a good sensitivity for the quantitative determination of Rosuvastatin calcium and hydrochlorothiazide in solid dosage form. The retention time for hydrochlorothiazide was 3.9 min and for Rosuvastatin calcium was 10.3 min. The isocratic program throughout HPLC method was adopted to analyze both components in a single run as shown in [Figure 3].
Method Validation
Validation was carried out with respect to various parameters, as required under ICH guideline Q2 (R1) The developed method was validated with respect to parameters such as linearity, precision, accuracy, specificity, ruggedness, robustness, and solution stability.[17]

Robustness
Robustness of the method was carried out by deliberately made small changes in the flow rate, pH, and organic phase ratio and column oven temperature. Results are presented in Table 5.
Limit of Detection (LOD) and Limit of Quantitation (LOQ)
LOD is defined as the lowest concentration of an analyte that can be reliably differentiated from background levels. LOQof an individual analytical procedure is the lowest amount of analyte that can be quantitatively determined with suitable precision and accuracy. LOD and LOQ of Rosuvastatin calcium and hydrochlorothiazide is calculated based on the standard deviation (SD) of response and slope of

calibration curve using formula.
LOD = /S × 3.3
LOQ = /S × 10
(where  is Standard deviation of response and S is slope of calibration curve)
The results of LOD and LOQ are mentioned in Table  6.
