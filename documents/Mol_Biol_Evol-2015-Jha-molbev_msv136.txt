Abstract
Complete genome resequencing of populations holds great promise in deconstructing
complex polygenic traits to elucidate molecular and developmental mechanisms of
adaptation. Egg size is a classic adaptive trait in insects, birds, and other taxa, but its
highly polygenic architecture has prevented high-resolution genetic analysis. We used
replicated experimental evolution in Drosophila melanogaster and whole-genome
sequencing to identify consistent signatures of polygenic egg size adaptation. A
generalized linear mixed model revealed reproducible allele frequency differences
at ~4,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP). Several hundred distinct genomic
regions contain clusters of these SNPs and have lower heterozygosity than the genomic
background, consistent with selection acting on polymorphisms in these regions. These
SNPs are also enriched among genes expressed in Drosophila ovaries and many of
these genes have well-defined functions in Drosophila oogenesis. Additional genes
regulating egg development, growth, and cell size show evidence of directional
selection as genes regulating these biological processes are enriched for highly
differentiated SNPs. Genetic crosses performed with a subset of candidate genes
demonstrated that these genes influence egg size, at least in the large genetic
background. These findings confirm the highly polygenic architecture of this adaptive
trait, and suggest the involvement of many novel candidate genes in regulating egg
size.

Introduction
The advent of whole-genome sequencing and inexpensive genotyping has reinvigorated
strategies for identifying genes undergoing adaptive change. One approach involves
scanning along the genome to identify regions with patterns or signatures of
polymorphism indicative of recent selection (Nielsen, et al. 2007; Rubin, et al. 2010;
Sabeti, et al. 2006; Voight, et al. 2006). Genomewide scans of reduced heterozygosity,
for example, have identified selective sweeps in many species including humans (Pickrell,
et al. 2009; Tishkoff, et al. 2007), domesticated chickens (Rubin, et al. 2010), Drosophila
Arabidopsis (Hancock, et al. 2011). In only a few cases, however, has it been possible to
directly associate a phenotypic trait with molecular adaptations. Moreover, polygenic
adaptations that draw on standing variation may not be detectable by scanning the
genome to identify regions with low heterozygosity (Burke 2012; Hermisson and Pennings
2005; Hernandez, et al. 2011; Pritchard and Di Rienzo 2010; Pritchard, et al. 2010;
Przeworski, et al. 2005). Natural populations may also experience selective forces that
are locale-specific, further obscuring the adaptive phenotype to which selection is
responding. Thus, the inverse problem of relating polymorphism data to a population
genetic model of adaptation does not easily lend itself to the identification of the actual
trait(s) under selection.
Experimental evolution in laboratory populations followed by whole genome sequencing,
commonly called “Evolve and Resequence (E&R)” (Turner, et al. 2011), is an attractive
alternative for investigating the genetic basis of a selected trait (Kawecki, et al. 2012).
The key to this approach lies in the control an investigator has in specifying the phenotype
under selection. The approach is seeing a resurgence in interest because it is now
possible to affordably resequence samples from evolved and control populations.
Because nearly every single nucleotide polymorphism in the population is surveyed by
whole genome population sequencing, all targets of selection are potentially identifiable.
Evolve and Resequence has been applied in Drosophila with varying degrees of success
to investigate the genetic basis of longevity and aging (Burke, et al. 2010; Remolina, et

melanogaster (Cassidy, et al. 2013; Garud, et al. 2013; Karasov, et al. 2010), and

al. 2012), body size (Turner, et al. 2011), hypoxia tolerance (Zhou, et al. 2011), courtship
song (Turner and Miller 2012), bristle development (Cassidy, et al. 2013), adaptation to
novel environments (Orozco-terWengel, et al. 2012), temperature (Tobler, et al. 2014)
and diet (Reed, et al. 2014). Drawbacks of this approach include the introduction of “false
positives” caused by (a) linkage and hitchhiking, which can be exacerbated by linkage
disequilibrium created by the investigator in the establishment of the artificial populations,
(b) by genetic drift, and (c) by unintended natural selection in the laboratory populations.
Oogenesis is a complex developmental process involving a large number of genes and
between fly species (Azevedo, et al. 1997; Lott, et al. 2007; Markow, et al. 2009) and has
long been recognized as an adaptive trait. It is positively correlated with many aspects of
offspring fitness— egg hatchability, embryonic viability, and embryonic development rate
and is responsive to thermal selection in laboratory populations (Azevedo, et al. 1997).
Egg size exhibits geographic clines in many species (Azevedo, et al. 1996), generally
increasing with latitude (James, et al. 1997). There can be little doubt, therefore, about
egg size being an adaptive trait subject to selection within and between species.
Despite the obvious importance (and experimental tractability) of egg size in Drosophila,
genetic mechanisms underlying variation in egg size remains poorly investigated
(Azevedo, et al. 1997), in part because of its polygenic nature. To the best of our
knowledge only a single study, conducted at the dawn of Drosophila Mendelian genetics,
has attempted to identify the genomic regions regulating egg size in flies (Warren 1924).
This study revealed that egg size in D. melanogaster is governed by a large number of
loci distributed throughout the genome. The resolution of the study, however, was limited
to large chromosomal regions.
To identify genes and variants involved in regulating egg size, we resequenced thricereplicated laboratory populations of D. melanogaster derived from wild-caught flies (in
Illinois, USA) that were artificially selected for both large and small egg volume (Miles, et
al. 2011). The large- and small-selected lines diverged from the starting populations by
an average of 1.5σP and 1.2σP, respectively; no detectable deviation from the starting

pathways in Drosophila (Klusza and Deng 2011). Egg size varies heritably within and

population was observed in the control populations. Subsequent analysis showed the
eggs to differ in the number of cells composing the blastoderm embryo, and a correlated
effect on the spatial localization of pair-rule stripes along both anterior-posterior and
dorsal-ventral axes (Miles, et al. 2011).
The experimental protocol to evolve egg size employed a number of favorable attributes
for follow-up resequencing — laboratory population established from a large fresh
collection of a single natural population, a period of laboratory acclimation of the
population for ten generations, artificial selection for both smaller and larger egg volume
population, artificial selection applied every other generation to enhance recombination,
and triplicate control populations. Using whole genome pooled sequencing on the
divergently selected populations, we identified several thousand reproducibly diverged
single nucleotide polymorphisms between the large and small egg size treatments. We
then applied additional filters to address linkage (and hitchhiking) of SNPs on selected
haplotypes. Clusters of significantly diverged variants and mRNA expression data were
used to identify potential targets of selection. Additional variants not organized into linked
clusters also show evidence of both directional selection and hitchhiking effects. Taken
together several hundred genes are conservatively identified as candidates affecting egg
size. As expected, genetic crosses performed with flies carrying mutant candidate genes
indicate that unlike monogenic traits, the effect size of each gene is likely to be modest in
this complex trait.

Results
Selection for egg size and resulting phenotypes
The schematic representation of the selection regimen is shown in Figure 1A. Nine
replicate populations were established from a large starting base population generated
by allowing the direct descendants of 120 wild-caught D. melanogaster isofemale lines to
mate at random for ten generations. Three of these were used to select for large egg

in triplicate populations, retention of an “ancestral” sample from the starting base

sizes (LEP1, LEP2, LEP3), three for small egg sizes (SEP1, SEP2, SEP3), and three
were maintained by randomly selecting equal numbers of eggs (CP1, CP2, CP3). Mean
egg volume (±SEM) in LEP, CP, and SEP were 12.1±0.02, 10.0±0.02 and 8.7±0.02 (X103

mm3) respectively (Miles, et al. 2011), indicating that egg size changed significantly in

opposite directions in both LEP and SEP compared to the CP (Figure 1B). The difference
in egg volumes in the evolved populations are comparable to those from twelve
Drosophila species (Markow, et al. 2009). For example, the LEP population produced a
large egg that was second only to the large-egg producing D. sechellia and the egg sizes
in SEP were comparable to those in D. simulans (Supplementary Figure 1). These
2008). Isogenic lines derived from each of the divergent population cages retained their
respective changes in egg sizes after 40 generations of inbreeding in the absence of
further selection for egg size (Supplementary Figure 1). The artificial selection for egg
size, therefore, appears to have targeted polymorphisms that are not deleterious under
laboratory conditions (Schwarzkopf, et al. 1999; Warren 1924).
Egg size and ovariole numbers
Drosophila ovaries contain over a dozen ovarioles and each ovariole contains multiple
developing oocytes (Figure 2A). Changes in egg size are thought to influence maternal
fitness (Azevedo, et al. 1997), which is correlated with ovariole number in adults
(Boulétreau-Merle, et al. 1982). Comparison of ovaries from adult females revealed that
ovariole numbers differ significantly between isofemale lines derived from the selected
populations for large and small eggs (P<0.0001, ANOVA, Figure 2B). Furthermore, within
each ovariole, egg chamber lengths differed significantly between a large and a small
lines as early as stage 4 of oogenesis (P<0.05, ANOVA, Figure 2C). Consistent with
these observations, we also observed strikingly higher egg volumes in all of the LEP
derived lines relative to each of the SEP derived lines (P<0.0001, ANOVA, Figure 2D).
In other words, compared to the flies derived from small egg populations, flies derived
from large egg population not only have fewer ovariole numbers, but they also have larger
eggs. Thus, these results suggest that egg size is correlated with ovariole numbers, at

species diverged from a common ancestor approximately 400,000 years ago (Cutter

least in these laboratory selected lines and could potentially affect female reproductive
fitness.
Sequencing statistics and genetic diversity
To identify genetic variants for egg-size we performed pooled whole genome sequencing
on the starting population and the nine terminal populations: 3 large egg populations, 3
small egg populations, and 3 control populations, using an Illumina HiSeq2000. Each of
the samples had greater than 51X median sequence coverage; ~80% of the genome in
each of the populations was sequenced greater than 40X (except CP2, 56% genome over
genome in the starting population was sequenced over 100X (Supplementary Table 1).
A total of 2,103,160 biallelic variants in the five major chromosome arms passed a series
of stringent filters (see Material and Methods). The median minor allele frequency in the
starting population was ~10%. 86% of these variants were also identified in 162 inbred
lines comprising the Drosophila melanogaster Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP)
(Mackay, et al. 2012), indicating that a large percentage of the polymorphisms in our
Illinois collection are common geographically widespread variants. The bulk of the genetic
diversity (66%-78%) was present in all nine samples and only 0.41% of the variants
(n=8,696) not detected in the starting population were found in a single population
sample. Only 0.27% (5,623) variants were not found in any of the nine experimental
populations and most of these lost variants (>80%) were low-frequency alleles in the
starting population with allele frequency less than 10%. After removing these 5,623
variants 2,097,537 variants remained for further analysis. The allele frequency spectrum
of these variants in each population is shown in Supplementary Figure 2.
Allele frequency divergence
The experimental design allowed us to identify SNP frequency changes in the artificially
selected populations that are unlikely to be the result of either genetic drift or natural
selection in the laboratory. In particular, whereas inconsistent frequency changes across
replicates may be attributable to drift, reproducible allele frequency changes across

40X). Median sequencing depth in the starting population was 220X and 98% of the

replicate populations exposed to the same selective pressure are likely to be enriched for
natural or artificial selection (Pritchard and Di Rienzo 2010; Pritchard, et al. 2010). Since
natural selection is expected to act consistently within the replicated populations but
divergently between the two selection treatments, we attempted to identify SNPs whose
frequencies differ consistently across replicates between the divergently selected
populations. We first calculated allele frequency differences between the starting
population and each of the nine terminal populations, and focused our attention on SNPs
whose frequencies changed in the same direction in all three replicates. We reasoned
these SNPs are likely to be enriched for sites under both natural and artificial selection in
observed in both the SEP and LEP compared to the CP (median allele frequency = 7.9%,
8.3%, and 7.7%, respectively, P<2.2e-16 for CP vs SEP and CP vs LEP, Wilcoxon rank
sum test). Over one hundred fifty thousand variants showed large and reproducible allele
frequency divergence in opposite directions across all three replicates between the
divergently selected populations (median difference = 13.77%).
To identify variants that have consistently diverged in response to egg-size selection, we
compared allele frequency differences between the three independent populations of LEP
and SEP at the 2,097,537 variants using a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM, see
Materials and Methods). This approach quantifies reproducible differences in allele
frequencies between the two treatments while taking into account differences in
sequencing depth and deviations of allele frequencies in each replicate population.
Variants with extreme p-values, i.e., ones exhibiting consistent differences in allele
frequencies between the large and small treatments, are putative targets of egg-size
selection. After adjusting for genomewide multiple testing using a stringent empirical
False Discovery Rate, FDR<5e-6, we identified 4,137 polymorphisms (0.20% of all the
variants in the genome) as significantly diverged variants, hereafter referred to as SDV
(Figure 3A, Supplementary Table 2). Only ~4% (n=169) of the SDV were low frequency
variants in the starting population (allele frequency ≤ 5%) and 98% were shared with
DGRP. We compared the starting allele frequency from the ~4,137 SDV to all other nonSDV in the genome and to 1,000 sets of randomly sampled 4,137 non-SDV. In both

the laboratory populations. Small but significantly greater frequency differences were

cases, we found that the starting allele frequencies of the SDV are qualitatively higher
than that of the non-SDV (Supplementary Figure 3), indicating adaptation occurred from
common standing variants.
We employed a conservative approach to further characterize each SDV by identifying
the smallest allele frequency difference between all nine possible LEP-SEP comparisons,
called “diffStat” (Turner, et al. 2011). The median diffStat score for SDVs, 32.22%, is 2.7
times higher than the genomewide median diffStat score (12.1% for SDV + non-SDV,
P<2.2e-16, Wilcoxon rank sum test, Figure 3B), demonstrating the consistency of the
relative to the genomewide background was observed at the non-SDV (P>0.05). The
higher diffStat scores in the SDV are robust even after taking starting allele frequencies
and chromosomal locations into account (P<0.0001, Permutation test, Supplementary
Figure 4A and 4B).
False positives, genetic hitchhiking, and gene expression
An unknown fraction of the SDV are expected to have diverged in frequencies not as a
consequence of selection acting on these SNP but rather as a result of genetic hitchhiking
with linked variants that are targeted by artificial selection (Nuzhdin and Turner 2013;
Tobler, et al. 2014). Although natural populations of D. melanogaster have relatively short
spans of linkage disequilibrium (LD), generally measured in 10’s or 100’s of base pairs
(Mackay, et al. 2012), experimentally evolved populations are likely to have larger spans
of LD that were created in establishing the founder laboratory population and expanded
through the course of the artificial selection experiment. Since individual haplotype
information is not available from the pooled-sequencing data, we could not measure
extent of LD in these populations. Instead, we attempted to identify genomic regions with
clusters of SDV. To identify such genomic regions, we divided the genome into bins of
100, 50, and 10 kilobase (kb) sliding windows with 25, 10, and 2kb step sizes respectively,
and performed a hypergeometric test comparing the proportion of SDV in each of the bins
to the chromosomal background (see Material and Methods). Applying a stringent
genomewide FDR to minimize the false positives (FDR<0.005), a total of 245, 342, and
9

diverged variants between the two treatments. No significant increase in diffStat score

415 windows were significant for 100, 50, and 10 kb windows respectively. There was,
not surprisingly, a strong overlap of signals between the sliding windows of different sizes
(Supplementary Figure 5). We chose to focus our attention on the 10kb windows for
further analysis because nearly all of the significant 100kb and 50kb windows also contain
the significant 10kb windows (Figure 4).
We next investigated the genomewide heterozygosity in 10kb sliding windows (with 2kb
step sizes) averaged across replicates of the three egg size treatments (LEP, SEP and
CP) and in the starting population. Compared to the starting population, a modest
(median fold reduction relative to starting population = 13%), though this reduction was
not significantly greater for the two selected treatments than for the control treatment. We
then turned our attention to the 415 significant windows enriched for the divergent variants
and found a more pronounced reduction in heterozygosity in them than in the
genomewide background in the CP, and a stronger reduction in the LEP than SEP (mean
fold reduction relative to starting population = 17.5%; P = 1.64e-06, one-sided Wilcoxon
rank sum test). The heterozygosity in 415 significant windows in LEP, when contrasted
with that in ten thousand sets of equal number of randomly sampled windows matched
by chromosomal arm in CP, was significantly lower the vast majority of times (P=6.6e-03,
Permutation test, Supplementary Figure 4C and 4D). Some of the significant windows
overlapped with one another and these comparisons do not take this dependence into
account. We therefore compared the reduction in heterozygosity in significant windows
to those in the exact same genomic regions in the CP and found stronger reduction in
heterozygosity in the significant windows (P = 6.27e-08, one-sided Wilcoxon rank sum
test). Comparison of all the SDV and only those in the 415 significant windows also
revealed that the latter have lower starting ancestral allele frequencies in the starting
population (P = 0.01, one-sided t-test). Low frequency variants are expected to have
originated more recently than common variants on average, and as a consequence would
be expected to be in stronger linkage disequilibrium with other linked variants, including
the SDV that are targeted by selection. Low frequency variants, therefore, may be more
detectable as hitchhiking variants.

reduction in genomewide heterozygosity was observed in all three egg size treatments

The 415 significant 10kb windows could be further consolidated into a smaller number of
distinct blocks. We first merged overlapping SDV within each block and then to be
conservative, expanded these blocks to include other 10kb blocks (or SDV) that were
within 50kb of one another. This procedure yielded 85 distinct genomic blocks (median
size ~18kb) separated by a median distance of ~480kb. The relatively large distance
between the 85 distinct SDV islands compared to the size of the islands raises the
prospect that each is an independent response to selection for egg-size. Individual blocks
may contain more than one SDV targeted by selection in addition to SDV that hitchhiked
due to linkage disequilibrium with the targeted SDV (Figure 5A). The 85 differentiated
genes are relevant to egg size evolution, we quantified their expression in D.
melanogaster ovaries using the RNA-seq data generated by the modENCODE
consortium (Graveley, et al. 2011) because egg size likely depends upon genes that are
expressed in the ovaries (Azevedo, et al. 1997). Compared to the genomic background,
the differentiated blocks were enriched for genes expressed in the Drosophila ovaries (n
= 174 with RPKM>0, P = 0.011, hypergeometric test). As a control, we also tested
whether the differentiated blocks are enriched for genes expressed in testis and found no
enrichment (P = 0.91). To identify candidate genes influencing egg size, we identified
genes within each differentiated block with higher expression in ovaries than the average
of all adult tissues measured, or the gene with the highest expression in the ovaries (if
none exceeded the average across tissues). This resulted in a total of 110 candidate
genes in the differentiated blocks (Figure 5B, Supplementary Table 3).
Compared to all the genes in the dataset, the 110 candidate genes are enriched for genes
with known functions in Drosophila oogenesis (n = 12, P<0.007, hypergeometric test).
These 12 genes include: Cullin-4 (Cul-4), bazooka (baz), Cbl, closca (clos), female sterile
(2) ltoPP43 (fs(2)ltoPP43), Mothers against dpp (Mad), midline (mid), Tao, cut (ct),
division abnormally delayed (dally), eyes-absent (eya) and Leukocyte-antigen-related like
(Lar). Although these genes have well-defined functions in Drosophila oogenesis, they
have no previously described role in regulating egg size. As a control, we evaluated
whether the candidate genes are enriched for genes with no obvious function in egg

development— namely, genes associated with male gamete generation and male
courtship behavior. No enrichment was observed (P>0.05).
Sixty percent of SDV do not fall into the differentiated blocks; we refer to these as ‘orphan
SDV’. With a conservative empirical False Discovery Rate set at 5e-06, these orphan SDV
are either enriched for additional targets of selection or differentiated by long-distance
linkage disequilibrium with targets of selection. The sample of flies used to found the
starting population contained a reasonably large number of wild chromosomes (N≥480)
and almost all the SDV were common polymorphisms. The lack of LD between common

Enrichment analysis and identification of additional candidate genes
To elucidate the functional properties of genes for egg-size targeted by selection, we
investigated the enrichment of Gene Ontology (GO) terms for genes harboring SDV. We
employed GOWINDA (Kofler and Schlotterer 2012), an unbiased analysis of gene set
enrichment, to identify statistically significant GO terms (among 2,834 possible terms,
Supplementary Table 4). We carried out two analyses: (1) on the full set of ~4,100 SDV,
and (2) on a selective set of 1,634 SDV, corresponding to the 40% most significant SDV
in the GLMM analysis. The p-value threshold for the 40% selective cutoff was established
by formulating an empirical null distribution of smallest p-values for all annotated genes
in the Drosophila genome (~16,340) and determining the p-value threshold for the top
10% (see Material and Methods for details).
Results of GOWINDA for the full set of SDV yielded no significant GO terms at FDR<5%,
suggesting that a substantial fraction of SDV are variants that have diverged in
frequencies as a result of genetic hitchhiking over short distances rather than as direct
targets of selection. The more selective set of 1,634 SDV in contrast, were enriched for
genes in several GO categories associated with egg development (blue dots in Figure
6A), cell size regulation (orange dots in Figure 6A), and growth (red dots in Figure 6A,
for complete GOWINDA analysis see Supplementary Table 4). In addition to the 2,836

variants in D. melanogaster may account for why SDV targeted by selection may be found

GO terms, we also separately tested whether all SDV or the selective set of SDV are
enriched for maternally transcribed genes (276 genes compiled from (Brody 2015),
Supplementary Table 5) and found no enrichment (P<0.05).
To further prioritize these genes, we focused on specialized GO terms (FDR<5%) that
are relevant for egg development. These include regulation of cell size, female gamete
generation, oogenesis, ovarian follicle cell development, germ cell migration, cell growth,
and growth because these biological processes are likely to influence egg size.
Combining genes in these GO terms yielded 95 candidates that are largely distinct from
not fall in long-range linkage blocks can also be targets of egg-size selection. Combining
all analyses, 193 genes can be considered candidates for influencing egg size
(Supplementary Table 6).
Genetic crosses reveal complex genetic architecture of egg size
Many of the 193 candidate genes identified above (Supplementary Table 6) have mutant
alleles allowing genetic analysis of their effects on egg size. We chose to investigate three
candidate genes, eyes absent (eya), procollagen lysyl hydroxylase (Plod), and
longitudinals lacking (lola). All three regulate development in multiple tissues, including
the egg chamber. Eyes-absent (eya) is a regulator of follicle cell polarity in egg chamber
formation during oogenesis (Bai and Montell 2002; Klusza and Deng 2011).
eya[3]/eya[E(P)10] also has egg chambers which contain abnormal germline cells (Bai
and Montell 2002). Procollagen lysyl hydroxylase (Plod) and longitudinals lacking (lola)
are both highly expressed in the ovaries (Graveley, et al. 2011). RNAi mediated
knockdown of Plod is reported to produce “round” eggs (Lerner, et al. 2013). Germline
clones of lola have numerous defects in egg chambers, including failure of nurse cells to
transfer their cytoplasmic content to the egg and nurse cell nuclei failing to undergo
programmed cell death (Bass, et al. 2007).
We carried out crosses with a strong (i.e., presumptive functional null) allele of each
candidate gene. All three mutants are recessive, fully viable, and fertile as heterozygotes.

candidate genes within the differentiated blocks (Figure 6B), indicating that SDV that do

Given the large numbers of genes involved in oogenesis, the contribution of a single gene
is likely to be small. Nonetheless, a subtle effect in egg size can be expected in
heterozygotes, if these genes contribute to egg size evolution. To test this hypothesis, we
crossed males bearing mutant alleles with females from three genetic backgrounds: the
laboratory strain: w1118 (because isofemale lines from CP are not available), a small egg
size inbred line, and a large egg size inbred line, each derived through repeated brothersister mating of an SEP or LEP selected fly, respectively. The resulting F1 females carry
one copy of the genome from their respective genetic backgrounds and the other from
the mutant strain with either a balancer chromosome or a chromosome carrying the
to those from sisters carrying the balancer chromosomes as well as the parental lines.
These data provide a measure of control for the effect of genetic background.
Comparison of eggs from females with the balancers to those from parental lines showed
that introduction of balancers increased egg length in w1118 and the small genetic
background (P<0.001, ANOVA, Supplementary Figure 6). This increase in egg length
varied for the three different balancers, indicating that genetic variation in different
balancers contribute differently to egg size, as expected for a polygenic trait. Interestingly,
the effect of the balancer was far stronger than any effect from the mutant chromosome
in these genetic backgrounds (Supplementary Figure 6), raising the possibility that
genetic background alone might account for the effect in these genetic backgrounds. In
the large genetic background, however, none of the balancers had any effect on egg
length (grey bars in Figure 7), whereas chromosomes containing mutant Plod and lola
alleles decreased egg length (P<0.001, ANOVA, light yellow bars in Figure 7),
consistent with the hypothesis that Plod and lola contribute to egg elongation in flies. In
summary, the genetic crossing results demonstrate that the candidate genes have
modest effects on egg size. While their effects are indistinguishable from that of the
genetic background in w1118 or small lines, they are appreciable in the large lines that we
examined.

mutant allele. We then compared egg sizes from F1 flies carrying the mutant chromosome

Discussion
Insect ovaries are compound organs composed of multiple autonomously functioning
subunits called ovarioles (Hodin 2009) and ovariole number has been the subject of
extensive ecological and quantitative genetic studies. The number of ovarioles differs
both within and between species (Büning 1998; Markow and O'Grady 2007; TelonisScott, et al. 2005). Positive associations of ovariole numbers with female fecundity have
been reported (Boulétreau-Merle, et al. 1982; Cohet and David 1978), suggesting that
ovariole number is related to reproductive success. Ovariole number varies along both
al. 2005b), and altitudinal clines ((Klepsatel, et al. 2014); but see (Collinge, et al. 2006)),
suggesting that it is an adaptive trait. Ovariole number increases with latitude
(Delpuech, et al. 1995; Gibert, et al. 2004; Schmidt, et al. 2005a; Schmidt, et al. 2005b),
as does egg volume (Azevedo, et al. 1996). Positive genetic correlations have also
been reported between ovariole number and thorax length (Bergland, et al. 2008).
Thorax length, fecundity and ovariole number are also positively correlated among
various Dosophilid species (Kambysellis and Heed 1971; R'Kha, et al. 1997). However,
both Wayne et al. (Wayne, et al. 1997) and Bergland et al. (Bergland, et al. 2012) failed
to detect a genetic correlation between ovariole number and various aspects of
reproductive fitness. Clearly, the relationship among these life-history traits is a
complicated one, also involving possible trade-offs with longevity (Wayne, et al. 2001).
Here we report a negative relationship between egg size and ovariole number in
multiple isofemale lines derived from the populations that were directly, and rapidly,
selected for egg volume (Miles, et al. 2011). It may be that direct truncation selection on
egg size over the short interval involved (18 months) simply did not allow enough time
for other morphological traits to “catch up” with increasing egg size. The selected
populations did not differ in body size at cessation of selection (Miles, et al. 2011). Thus,
body size itself may have presented a physical constraint resulting in reduced ovariole
number in large lines. Lower ovariole numbers are correlated with larger egg size in
some Drosophilds (and other flies), especially those that have become ecologically
specialized (Kambysellis, et al. 1995; Markow, et al. 2009; R'Kha, et al. 1997). We are

continuing to examine sequence data in these inbred lines, as well as the process of
ovary morphogenesis itself, and comparing these to cold-adapted laboratory evolving
flies that came from the same base population.
Using experimental evolution followed by whole genome sequencing, we investigated
the genetic basis of egg size evolution in a well replicated experiment for both larger
and smaller egg volume. A notable feature of the experimental design was the
establishment of a base population from a large and fresh collection of flies, which was
then allowed to adapt to the laboratory environment as a large cage population for ten
smaller eggs and controls. Importantly, a sample was also collected from the base
population at the time the experimental cages were formed to compare with both the
control and selected populations. The experimental populations were maintained at
approximately 2,000 flies, although truncation selection reduced this number in
alternating generations to 110 (selected from 500 measured eggs). Seventeen rounds
of selection were imposed every other generation, allowing population size to rebound
and recombination to further mix the selected genomes.
We gained considerable statistical power by comparing the two divergently selected
treatments and found a large number of variants whose allele frequencies changed
consistently across the thrice replicated populations. Applying the stringent requirement
that an SDV must consistently diverge from the starting population in all three replicates
eliminated a number of targets of selection that diverged on average but almost
certainly also reduced the number of false positive SDV. Comparison of LEP and SEP
should also eliminate variants under background natural selection since all treatments
were adapting in identical cage conditions. As predicted, SDV identified from the
comparison of LEP and SEP treatments showed greater allele frequency divergence
than controls, indicating egg size specific selection was stronger than background
natural selection and affected several thousand variants. Within this embarrassment of
riches, the more challenging problem is to estimate how many of these variants are
targets of trait-specific selection and how many result from hitchhiking and/or long-range
linkage in the laboratory populations.

Large numbers of significant variants due to pervasive hitchhiking spanning thousands
of kilobases have been reported in experimental evolution studies (Cassidy, et al. 2013;
Orozco-terWengel, et al. 2012; Remolina, et al. 2012; Tobler, et al. 2014; Turner and
Miller 2012; Zhou, et al. 2011). Our study is also consistent with hitchhiking effects
acting over both short and long physical scales. Differentiated blocks contain clusters of
several significant SNP (median = 7, min = 4, and max = 20) spanning ~18kb on
average, all of which are unlikely to be targets of selection for egg size. Hence, several
variants included in each block must be hitchhiking with one or few variants that are
targeted by selection. Similarly, on a larger physical scale, the complete set of ~4,100
gene ontology enrichment. This lack of distinguishing characteristics may be evidence
of the prevalence of genetic hitchhiking or long range associations acting over long
physical distances (Nuzhdin and Turner 2013).
Nevertheless, hitchhiking or long-range association cannot be the sole reason for the
large number of SDV in our study, as evidenced by enrichment of genes related to
oogenesis found in the differentiated blocks. In fact, the majority of the SDV reside
outside of the differentiated blocks and the selective set of ~1,600 most significant SDV
(40% of all SDV) are enriched for gene ontology terms that are functionally relevant for
reproduction and egg development. Moreover, our genetic crosses demonstrate that
chromosomes bearing mutant alleles of two candidate genes, Plod and lola, influence
egg size, indicating that the candidate genes we have identified are functionally relevant
for egg size evolution. One may argue that other unknown variants on the chromosome
carrying these mutant alleles, but not these mutant alleles themselves, may have
contributed to the reduction in egg length. However, RNAi mediated knockdown of Plod
also results in reduced egg length in D. melanogaster (Lerner, et al. 2013).
Furthermore, several genes in our list of candidates have been shown to be associated
with ovariole number variation. The role of ecdysone signaling in establishment and
maintenance of the stem cell niche in the Drosophila ovary has received considerable
attention recently (Belles and Piulachs 2014). Two members of this pathway,
ultraspiracle (usp) and Eip75B, are present in our candidate list. Ultraspiracle regulates

SDV, which are separated by an average of ~28kb, displayed a complete absence of

the timing of ovarian morphogenesis and influences the number of functional niches
(Hodin and Riddiford 1998; König, et al. 2011). Overexpression of Eip75B, a nuclear
hormone receptor and target of the ecdysone cascade, results in changes in timing of
primordial germ cell differentiation into germline stem cells (Gancz, et al. 2011). Another
candidate gene Axin (Axn) is associated with ovariole numbers in D. melanogaster
(Wayne and McIntyre 2002). Axn is a negative regulator of wg/Wnt signaling (Willert, et
al. 1999). Wingless is expressed in both terminal filament and cap cells and is known to
regulate the maintenance of somatic stem cells in the ovary (Song and Xie 2003).
Hedgehog, also a candidate gene in our populations, is required for proliferation and
between the somatic and germline cells in the developing ovary (Besse, et al. 2005).
Similarly, another promising candidate in our list is Rassf, an antagonist of the Hippo
pathway, which is involved in regulation of proliferation and cell death, thereby
controlling cell number in many tissues (Polesello, et al. 2006) and limiting organ size
(Zhao, et al. 2010). Hippo activity has been shown to influence the total number of
terminal filament cells (Sarikaya, et al. 2012) and regulate the growth of stem cell niche
precursors in the developing ovary (Sarikaya and Extavour 2015). The presence among
our candidates of key members of pathways known to influence ovariole number
strengthens the idea that genes underlying the trait of egg size are also present.
Unfortunately, many fewer studies attempting to identify the genes and pathways
associated with variability in egg size have been completed. It is also noteworthy that
many SDV are located in genes that have no annotated functions in flies (CG genes) or
no known roles in egg development. For example, one of the differentiated blocks
contains a micro-RNA, miR-280, which has no known functions in egg development, but
has been implicated in the reduction of egg size in D. melanogaster (Nakahara, et al.
2005). Future functional analysis of these candidate genes may reveal their effects on
egg size.
Our results contrast with previous studies that have reported striking changes in allele
frequencies between divergently selected populations coupled with marked reduction in
heterozygosity after long term experimental evolution in laboratory lines (>100

generations) (Burke, et al. 2010; Turner, et al. 2011; Zhou, et al. 2011). Large reduction
in heterozygosity was also observed in a short term study (15 generations) when a few
isogenized laboratory fly lines were used to found the initial base population (Cassidy,
et al. 2013). The lack of congruence between results from our study and those from
previous studies may be attributed to three major differences in our experiment. First,
artificial selection was applied for a relatively small number of generations. With a
modest selection intensity (~20% threshold), not enough time may have passed for
beneficial alleles to approach fixation, thus limiting greater loss of heterozygosity.
Second, selection was imposed in alternating generations allowing population sizes to
derived from relatively large collection of wild-caught isofemales that were allowed to
adapt to the lab prior to establishing the treatment populations. Unlike isogenic lines or
strains that have been maintained in the laboratory for many generations, natural
populations of flies have abundant genetic diversity and polymorphisms are likely to be
distributed in multiple haplotypes by recombination. When variants such as these come
under selection, appreciable allele frequency differences can occur without
commensurate loss of genetic diversity at linked sites, as the theory of “soft sweeps”
and “polygenic adaptation” shows (Burke 2012; Hermisson and Pennings 2005).
Such signatures in our selected populations — marked allele frequency difference
accompanied by small reduction in heterozygosity— suggest that SDV are enriched for
common polymorphisms. Most of the significantly diverged variants in our evolved
populations are also present in the DGRP lines, which provides additional evidence that
adaptation likely occurred from common standing polymorphisms. However, it is
noteworthy that the experimental design and method to identify SDV has greater power
to detect common variants than rare variants for a number of reasons. First, even if they
are beneficial, rare variants can be easily lost during laboratory selection due to genetic
drift in the replicate cages. Second, artificial selection of a rare variant would only be
effective in one phenotypic direction. Our study compares differentiated SNPs between
large and small selected populations, and thus will be inherently biased towards
identifying common polymorphisms. For these reasons, this study may not address the

broader, historically important, question about the relative contributions of common vs.
rare mutations to complex fitness-related traits (Charlesworth 2015).
Interestingly even after including all the significant variants encompassed by the 193
candidate genes, a large proportion of the SDV remain unaccounted for. Some of these
SDV might be false positives that have persisted for reasons other than hitchhiking but
many are likely to be in genes that have yet uncharacterized functions in egg
development that were subject to selection. However, the large number of significant
variants may also be a result of compensatory adaptation in other developmental and
Hoffmann 2000). One of the genes with strong evidence of selection, for example is
Kruppel (Kr). While Kr itself is not known to be associated with egg size, it plays a
crucial role in embryonic patterning, which must scale with egg size (Lott, et al. 2007;
Lott, et al. 2011; Miles, et al. 2011). Furthermore, it is plausible that a proportion of the
SDV could be under selection to ameliorate maladaptive correlated effects resulting
from pleiotropy. Although it is difficult to pinpoint the numbers of variants that could be
under selection in response to egg size evolution, our results indicate that at least a few
hundred variants in over two hundred genes may have contributed to egg-size
evolution. That a large number of variants are relevant to selection in our experimental
populations is not unexpected: such signatures of polygenic adaptation are well known
in flies (Turner, et al. 2011) as well as human populations (Turchin, et al. 2012).
In addition to revealing candidate genes that affect egg size, our results also highlight
the limitations of experimental evolution approaches that have emerged as a common
theme in studies employing this technique. First, despite large population size
(N=2,000) truncation selection induced mild population reduction in alternating
generations resulting in 110 flies (220 chromosomes). Although allowing population size
to rebound allowed recombination to further mix the selected genomes, small population
size exacerbates linkage disequilibrium over short and long distances. To ameliorate
the effects of hitchhiking, increasing population sizes and/or the number of replicate
populations may aid future studies to identify the true targets of selection. Second, the
complexity of experimental evolution studies allows sources of error to be introduced at

several stages, all of which are difficult to take into account. For instance, we performed
high depth sequencing and used read depth rather than allele frequencies in the GLMM
to avoid read count induced variation in estimating allele frequencies. However,
additional unaccounted sources of variability that persisted may have inflated the
number of SDV. Third, whole genome forward simulations, especially that account for
all the events during an experimental evolution, is still a significant undertaking and
theoretical and computational advancements in this area are highly desirable. Hence,
our data may be useful in exploring designs to investigate genetic basis of complex
traits using this this powerful approach in future studies.

molecular evolution of complex traits. First, our results demonstrate that fly populations
have a large reservoir of common variation that can fuel their rapid response to a
selective challenge. The signature of selection from these variants is different from that
of new beneficial mutations — the reduction in heterozygosity may be relatively small
both in scope and magnitude — and will not be detectable by methods identifying hardselective sweeps. Methods to detect “soft” sweeps may be more relevant to detecting
QTL underlying polygenic traits such as egg size. Second, experimental evolution
followed by pooled whole genome sequencing can be an effective method for dissecting
the genetic basis of complex traits such as egg size evolution. With a well structured
experimental design, large numbers of variants responding to artificial selection can be
identified with confidence, and integrating additional publicly available information can
result in a refined list of candidate genes that can be tested for function. Our results
indicate that a few hundred naturally existing common variants in at least one hundred
genes are likely to regulate egg-size differences in D. melanogaster.

Materials and Methods
Drosophila melanogaster populations and phenotype
The selection scheme and egg volume measurements have previously been described
in detail (Miles, et al. 2011). Briefly, a base population, created from a sample of 120 wildcaught non-virgin female flies from Illinois, USA, was established. This base population
was then maintained at large population size allowing random mating for 10 generations
to allow adaptation to laboratory conditions. This population served as the starting base
population. Nine replicate populations were established by sampling individuals from the
(LEP) and three were used to select for small egg volumes (SEP). The remaining three
were maintained as controls (CP) in identical laboratory conditions but no artificial
selection on egg volume was applied. 19.1% truncation selection was applied in
alternating generations by measuring 500 eggs and selecting 110 eggs to found the
subsequent generation in each replicate population. We calculated egg volume using the
following formula:
Volume =

Selection was conducted for 16 generations. Each generation was 16 days and
generations were non-overlapping. Adult females from the 17th generation were used for
whole genome sequencing.
Ovariole numbers, egg size, and egg chamber length measurements
After the 17th generation, selection was stopped and inbred fly lines were derived from
the LEP and SEP population cages by isolating individual mothers and allowing brothersister mating of offspring for 40 generations. Ten of the inbred lines, five for large and
small eggs, were used to measure ovariole numbers. These flies were raised in low
density cultures at 25°C, over standard fly media. Non-virgin females were kept over
yeast for 3-4 days post-eclosion before ovaries were dissected with forceps under a

of potassium dichromate for approximately 10 minutes and tungsten needles were used
to tease apart the ovarioles. Ovariole number was manually counted using a
stereomicroscope. Egg volumes were measured as described above using 50 eggs from
each of the ten inbred lines (n=500 eggs in total). ANOVA with lines nested within the
treatments was used to assess difference between mean egg volumes between the LEP
and SEP derived lines. To measure egg chamber size, ovarioles were obtained from one

DNA extraction, sequencing, and alignment
Pooled DNA was extracted from 100 females per population using phenol chloroform to
create a total of ten pooled-DNA samples: 1 starting population, 3 LEP, 3 SEP, and 3 CP.
Each pooled-DNA sample was fragmented to 500bp using a Covaris sonicator. DNA
fragments were size selected and Illumina libraries were generated from each of the 10

Genotyping and identification of high-confidence variants
Bam files from all ten populations were merged and sequence reads with mapping

confidence. Samtools –pileup (Li, et al. 2009) was used to call SNP and small indels and
additional information such as base quality, mapping quality, and SNP quality at each

Over 40M variant positions were initially identified as polymorphic in the VarRef, many of
which appeared to be trialleleic positions reflecting potential sequencing errors. To
determine the threshold for sequencing errors empirically, we considered only the triallelic
positions. Assuming 90% of the third alleles are due to sequencing error, we set the
sequencing error threshold at the 90th quantile in the read count distribution of the third
allele position in the VarRef (read count = 13). Variant positions were the two nonreference allele counts were >13 were considered true triallelic variants and removed
from further analysis. Only those bi-allelic positions with non-reference allele count >13
were further considered. Over 8.1M bi-allelic positions passed these criteria. We further
removed highly (>90th quantile biallelic sites, >995X) and lowly (<10X in each of the ten
populations) covered bi-allelic positions and calculated 95% binomial confidence interval
for the minor allele at each variant position in each population. Positions with lower bound
95%CI for the minor allele above zero in any one of the ten populations were considered
high-confidence polymorphisms. A total of 2,149,584 high-confidence polymorphisms
were identified of which 2,103,160 were in the five major chromosome arms and were
used in subsequent analysis.

immediately upstream or downstream were considered.
Allele frequency divergence and diffStat
Allele frequency was estimated as a ratio of variant counts to coverage. To calculate allele
frequency changes due to laboratory or egg-size selection, we first identified variants that
have shifted in the same directions relative to the starting population in all three replicates
in each treatment and then calculated the average allele frequency change relative to the
starting population across each treatment, i.e, (abs(average(p1-starting population, p2allele frequency difference between the LEP and SEP, we first identified variants that
have shifted in the same direction relative to the starting population in all three replicate
populations of the LEP and SEP. We then calculated difference in average allele
frequencies between the two treatments.
To calculate diffStat statistic, we first calculated change in allele frequencies between all
nine possible combinations of large and small treatments. We then identified variants that
have changed in consistent directions in all nine comparisons. Then we calculated the
minimum absolute change in allele frequency difference between the two treatments as
the diffStat score i.e, abs(min(LEP1-SEP1, LEP1-SEP2, LEP1-SEP3, LEP2-SEP1,
LEP2-SEP2, LEP2-SEP3, LEP3-SEP1, LEP3-SEP2, LEP3-SEP3)).
Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM)
Although Fishers Exact Test (FET) has been used previously (Burke, et al. 2010;
Remolina, et al. 2012) to quantify allele frequency changes between two populations, this
method for quantifying selection from pooled-sequencing data has a high false positive
rate (Turner, et al. 2011). False positives could result because the variance in allele
frequencies between populations are not accounted for and errors in allele frequency
estimates due to varying sequencing depth in each sample are ignored.

In pooled sequencing, the basic statistics are the read counts at each variant position,
treatment-groups, and the number of replicate populations within each treatment. Since
these types of data are not expected to be normally distributed, traditional normality based
tests are also not useful but a Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) is appropriate
(Bolker, et al. 2009). A GLMM can be used to identify highly correlated and systematic
allele frequency changes between two treatments while simultaneously taking
fluctuations in allele frequencies between replicate populations within each treatment into
account. Systematic and reproducible changes in allele frequencies in multiple replicate
populations can be attributable to selection whereas, random changes can be due to drift.
account differences in sequencing depth at each variant position in each replicate
population. A p-value for the fixed-effects can be calculated for each variant in the dataset
and the extreme p-values represent highly correlated allele frequency differences
between the two treatments.
Hence, we implemented a Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) to quantify the allele
frequency divergence due to selection between the large and small egg size populations
using the R package ‘lme4’. For each variant, read count (reference=0, variant=1) was
the outcome variable. Read count at bi-allelic positions was assumed to be binomially
distributed and treatment groups (large-eggs and small-eggs) were specified to have fixed
effects while each replicate population was specified to have random effects. P-values
for each variant position were obtained using the default parameters. To assess
genomewide multiple-testing threshold, False Discovery Rate (FDR) was calculated
using q-values using “pi0.method=smoother” (Storey and Tibshirani 2003). For a very
stringent FDR of 0.0005% (FDR≤5e-6), the p-value cutoff was 1.29e-8. Hence, any variant
with p-value below 1.29e-8 was considered statistically significant. These variants are
among the most differentiated (extreme outliers) in the dataset and are likely to be
enriched for targets of selection.

Hypergeometric test and scans for reduced heterozygosity
To test whether the significantly diverged variants are overrepresented in certain genomic
windows, we performed a hypergeometric test for 100, 50, and 10kb sliding windows with
25, 10, and 2kb step size in each major chromosome arm as follows: the total number of
variants (n) and SDV (s) in each window were assessed. Given the total numbers of
variants (N) and total number of SDV (S) in each chromosome arm, we computed the
probability (P) of observing s SDV when n variants are sampled. For multiple-testing
adjustment, q-values were estimated as above and FDR≤0.005 was used as the

Maximum likelihood estimate of gene diversity (heterozygosity) in each replicate
population was calculated using the following equation as described in (Weir 1996):
𝑚

1
̂𝑃 = 1 − ∑ ∑ 𝑝̃𝑖2
𝐻
𝑚
𝑙=1 𝑖=1

Here 𝑝̃𝑖 is the observed allele frequency at each base and m is the non-overlapping
window-size where l polymorphic loci were identified. Genomewide pooled gene diversity
(HP) was calculated for all ten populations in 100, 50, and 10 kb sliding windows with 25,
10 and 2kb step sizes respectively. For each window size, fold reduction in heterozygosity
was calculated by averaging the HP scores across the three replicates in each treatment
and dividing that by the HP in the starting population. The fold change in the terminal
populations were also similar regardless of the window sizes.
Permutation test for diffStat and heterozygosity
To test whether the differentiated variants have higher diffStat scores compared to the
non-differentiated variants matched by chromosomal location, we compared the
differentiated variants to ten thousand sets of equal numbers of randomly selected
variants matched by the chromosome arm. We then asked whether it is possible to
observe median diffStat scores as high as or higher than that observed with differentiated
variants in the permuted set. We never observed higher median diffStat scores in the

permuted sets (P = 0/10,000 <0.0001). We also repeated the same procedure with
variants matched by chromosome arm and ancestral allele frequency but did not observe
higher median diffStat scores in the permuted sets (P = 0/10,000 <0.0001).
We contrasted the heterozygosity in 415 significant windows in LEP with that in ten
thousand sets of equal number of randomly sampled windows matched by chromosomal
arm in CP. For each set we asked whether as much as (15.29%) or stronger reduction in
median heterozygosity relative to the starting population can be observed in the permuted
set of windows and found that only 66 out of 10,000 permuted sets showed ≥15.29%

Enrichment analysis
We used GOWINDA (Kofler and Schlotterer 2012) to perform Gene Ontology enrichment
analysis. GOWINDA calculates p-values for enrichment of each GO term by simulating
large sets of randomly sampled SNP and such permutation of the genome eliminates
biases associated with gene length and reduces false positive GO terms (Kofler and
Schlotterer 2012). All the GO terms in D. melanogaster were downloaded using
FuncAssociate2.0 (Kofler and Schlotterer 2012). Gene sets *with less than 10 genes were
excluded which resulted in 3,317 GO terms of which 2,836 terms had at least one gene
with a SDV. We conducted 100,000 simulations for each of the 2,834 GO terms using
gene annotations based on D. melanogaster reference genome version 3.0 and full
coding region ± 500bp flanking regions were considered (-gene option in GOWINDA).
To generate a selected set of SDV, we first generated an empirical null distribution by
identifying the variant with smallest p-value from the GLMM for all genes in the entire
dataset (N~16,340). We then identified the variants in the top 10% tail of this distribution
as the selected set of variants. Since the 10% p-value threshold is at least an order of
magnitude higher than the genomewide significance threshold (P = 1.29e-8 at FDR<5e-6),
the SDV in this analysis reflect the most divergent variants in the data set.

[clift1]FRT40/CyO Act-GFP), and lola (cn[1] P{ry[+t7.2]=PZ}lola[00642]/CyO; ry[506],
Bloomington Drosophila stock center number 10946) were gifts from Sally HorneBadovinac. Crosses were raised at 25⁰C. Five males from each mutant line were
crossed with five females from each of the large, small, and w1118 lines. As the adult
flies began eclosing, virgin F1 females carrying the mutant genes were identified and
isolated in 6-8 hour intervals. These females were backcrossed with males of their
five females and five males. 20-25 eggs from each replicate for each mutant cross for
each gene were measured as described above and previously (Miles, et al. 2011). Eggs
from mothers carrying a mutant copy of the gene were compared to sisters carrying
balancer chromosomes as well as with parental lines in large, small, and w1118
backgrounds and statistical significance was measured using ANOVA. P-values less
than 0.05 were considered significant.

egg sizes due to artificial selection. On the x-axis are number of selected generations.
Mean egg volumes in each of the three large (yellow), small (green), and controls (grey)
in each selected generations are shown. Compared to the controls, egg volumes
increased and decreased significantly in the LEP, SEP respectively and no significant
difference was observed in the CP.

of the Drosophila melanogaster ovaries with ovarioles extending out with egg chambers
at various developmental stages. B) Mean ovariole numbers per female (±SEM) in ten
isofemale lines derived from the large (yellow) and small (green) selected populations
(n=10 pairs per line) are shown. P-value was obtained from a nested ANOVA performed
to compare ovariole numbers between large and small populations by nesting lines
within the treatments. Both lines and treatments were significant. C) Difference in mean
(±SEM) egg chamber lengths between a large and a small line at various stages of
oogenesis. D) Egg volumes of isofemale lines derived from the large (yellow) and small
populations (green, n=50 per line). The boxes indicate the first and third quartiles and
the whiskers indicate the interquartile ranges (1.5* IQR).

indistinguishable. Almost 50% of the significant windows are on chromosome 2 and
24% are on chromosome X.
Figure 5. A representative differentiated block and expression of candidate genes

regions. Notice two distinct peaks separated by several kb regions in the shaded area
(orange). Since these two peaks are less than 50kb apart, they are likely in long-range
linkage and thus, are considered a single significantly diverged block. Purple line
SDV are shown in black. Genes with at least one SDV and are expressed in the ovaries
are shown in blue. B) Gene expression of 110 candidate genes in adult tissues. Colors
indicate relative expression in each tissue (RE) compared to the average of all the adult
tissues. Rows are tissues and columns are genes.
Figure 6. Enrichment of SDV for biologically relevant GO categories. A) Selected set
of 1,634 SDV are enriched for genes in several GO categories. On the x-axis are number
of genes with at least one SDV in each category and y-axis indicates significance of
enrichment after correcting for multiple testing. Dotted purple line indicates FDR<5%.
Each dot is a GO category and size of the dots indicate the total number of genes in each
GO category. Dots in grey: broad GO categories containing several specialized GO
terms; dots in blue, red and orange: GO categories associated with reproduction (and
egg development), growth, and cell size, respectively. B) Overlap of genes harboring the
enriched SDV in GO categories associated with cell size, egg development, and growth.
Genes in differentiated blocks are largely distinct from those encompassed by the
differentiated blocks. All of the genes in the differentiated blocks are expressed in the
Drosophila ovaries (Figure 5B).
Figure 7. Genetic crosses show candidate genes affect egg size. Comparison of egg
length from parental isogenic lines derived from large population cages (dark yellow) to
those from F1 females carrying one copy of balancer (grey) or one copy of mutant
chromosome of the indicated genes (light yellow). No detectable difference in egg length

balancer (grey). However, females carrying chromosomes with the mutant alleles of Plod
and lola (light yellow) produced significantly shorter eggs. Y-axis indicates mean length
