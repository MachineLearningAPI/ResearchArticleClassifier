Schr¨
odinger’s thought experiment to prepare a cat in a superposition of both alive and dead states
reveals profound consequences of quantum mechanics and has attracted enormous interests. Here
we propose a straightforward method to create quantum superposition states of a living microorganism by putting a small bacterium on top of an electromechanical oscillator. Our proposal is
based on recent developments that the center-of-mass oscillation of a 15-µm-diameter aluminium
membrane has been cooled to its quantum ground state [Nature 475, 359 (2011)], and entangled
with a microwave field [Science, 342, 710 (2013)]. A microorganism with a mass much smaller than
the mass of the electromechanical membrane will not significantly affect the quality factor of the
membrane and can be cooled to the quantum ground state together with the membrane. Quantum
superposition and teleportation of its center-of-mass motion state can be realized with the help of
superconducting microwave circuits. More importantly, the internal states of a microorganism, such
as the electron spin of a glycine radical, can be prepared in a quantum superposition state and entangled with its center-of-mass motion. Our proposal can be realized with state-of-art technologies.
The proposed setup is also a quantum-limited magnetic resonance force microscope (MRFM) that
not only can detect the existence of an electron spin, but also can coherently manipulate and detect
the quantum state of the spin.

INTRODUCTION

In 1935, Erwin Schr¨odinger proposed a famous thought
experiment to prepare a cat in a superposition of both
alive and dead states [1]. He imagined that a cat, a small
radioactive source, a Geiger counter, a hammer and a
small bottle of poison were sealed in a chamber. If one
atom of the radioactive source decays, the counter will
trigger a device to release the poison. So the state of the
cat will be entangled with the state of the radioactive
source. After a certain time, the cat will be in superposition of both alive and dead states. The possibility
of an organism to be in a superposition state is counterintuitive and dramatically reveals the profound consequences of quantum mechanics. Besides their importance
in studying foundations of quantum mechanics, quantum
superposition and entangled states are key resources for
quantum metrology and quantum information [2]. Furthermore, the explanation of how a “Schr¨odinger’s cat”
state collapses is the touchstone of different interpretations of quantum mechanics. While many-worlds interpretations propose that there is no wave function collapse
[3, 4], objective collapse theories [5–8] propose that the
wave function collapse is an intrinsic event that happens
spontaneously.

The “Schr¨odinger’s cat” thought experiment has attracted enormous interest since it was proposed eighty
years ago [2]. Many great efforts have been made to create large quantum superposition states. Superposition
states of photons, electrons, atoms, and some molecules
have been realized [9]. Wavelike energy transfer through
quantum coherence in photosynthetic systems has been
observed [10, 11]. Recent developments in quantum optomechanics [12–15] and electromechanics [16–23] provide new opportunities to create even larger superposition states experimentally [24]. In 2009, Romero-Isart et
al proposed to optically trap a living microorganism in
a high-finesse optical cavity in vacuum to create a superposition state [25]. This paper increased our hope to
experimentally study the quantum nature of living organisms [1, 26, 27]. Meanwhile, Li et al demonstrated
optical trapping of a pure silica microsphere in air and
vacuum [28], and cooled its center-of-mass motion from
room temperature to about 1.5 mK in high vacuum [29].
Recently, parametric feedback cooling [30] and cavity
cooling of pure dielectric nanoparticles [31–33] were also
demonstrated. These are important steps towards quantum ground state cooling of a levitated dielectric particle.
Optical trapping of an organism in vacuum, however, has
not been realized experimentally. The main difficulty is
that the optical absorption coefficient [34] of organisms
is much larger than that of a pure silica particle, which
can lead to significant heating of an optically trapped microorganism in vacuum. Recently, Fisher proposed that
the nuclear spin of phosphorus can serve as the putative

2
quantum memory in brains [35].
Here we propose to create quantum superposition and
entangled states of a living microorganism by putting
a small bacterium on top of an electromechanical oscillator, such as a membrane embedded in a superconducting microwave resonant circuit (Fig. 1). Our proposal also works for viruses. Since many biologists do
not consider viruses as living organisms [27], we focus on
small bacteria in this paper. Our proposal has several
advantages. First, it avoids the laser heating problem
as no laser is required in our scheme. Second, quantum ground state cooling and advanced state control of
an electromechanical oscillator integrated in a superconducting circuit have been realized experimentally [16–
21, 23]. Quantum teleportation based on superconducting circuits has also been demonstrated [36]. In addition,
most microorganisms can survive in the cryogenic environment that is required to achieve ground state cooling
of an electromechanical oscillator. Although microorganisms are frozen in a cryogenic environment, they can be
still living and become active after thawing [37]. Cryopreservation is a mature technology that has been used
clinically worldwide [37]. Most microorganisms can be
preserved for many years in cryogenic environments [38].
Even some organs [39] can be preserved at cryogenic temperatures. More importantly, the internal states of a microorganism, such as the electron spin of a glycine radical
−
˙
NH+
3 CHCOO [40, 41], can also be prepared in superposition states and entangled with its center-of-mass motion
in the cryogenic environment. This will be remarkably
similar to Schr¨odinger’s initial thought experiment of entangling the state of an entire organism (‘alive’ or ‘dead’
state of a cat) with the state of a microscopic particle (a
radioactive atom).
Our proposed setup not only can be used to study
macroscopic quantum mechanics, but also has applications in quantum-limited magnetic resonance force microscopy (MRFM) for sensitive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of biological samples [42]. This will provide
more than structural information that can be obtained
by cryo-electron microscopy [43], which also requires the
sample to be cooled to cryogenic temperatures. This system can coherently manipulate and detect the quantum
states of electron spins, which enables single electron
spins that could not be read with optical or electrical
methods to be used as quantum memory.

THE MODEL

Recently, a 15-µm-diameter aluminum membrane with
a thickness of 100 nm has been cooled to quantum
ground state by sideband cooling with a superconducting inductor-capacitor (LC) resonator [17]. Coherent
state transfer between the membrane and a traveling microwave field [19], as well as entangling the motion of
the membrane and a microwave field [18] have been realized. The experiment in Ref. [17] was performed in a

FIG. 1. (a) Scheme to create quantum superposition states
of a microorganism by putting a small bacterium or a virus
with a mass of m on top of an electromechanical membrane
oscillator with a mass of Mmem . The membrane is the upper
plate of a capacitor embedded in a superconductor inductorcapacitor (LC) resonator. The LC resonator is coupled to a
transmission line. The membrane has an intrinsic mechanical
oscillation frequency of Ωm and a linewidth of Γm when the
microorganism is not on it. The LC resonator has a resonant
frequency of ωc and an energy decay rate of κ. Some microorganisms have smooth surfaces (b) while some have pili
on their surfaces (c).

cryostat at 15 mK. The mechanical oscillation frequency
of this membrane is about 10 MHz, with a mechanical
quality factor of 3.3 × 105 . The mass of the membrane
is 48 pg (2.9 × 1013 Da). As shown in Table I, this mass
is about four orders larger than the mass of ultra-small
bacteria and even more orders larger than the mass of
viruses [44–50]. We can use this membrane oscillator to
create quantum superposition states of a small microorganism. Among different cells, mycoplasma bacteria are
particularly suitable for performing this experiment because they are ubiquitous and their sizes are small [48].
In addition, they have been preserved at cryogenic temperatures [38]. It will also be interesting to create superposition states of prochlorococcus. Prochlorococcus is
presumably the most abundant photosynthetic organism
on the earth, with an abundance of about 105 cells/mL
in surface seawater [49, 51]. It can be used to study
quantum processes in photosynthesis.
As shown in Fig. 1a, we consider a bacterium or virus
on top of an electromechanical membrane oscillator. We
assume the mass of the microorganism m is much smaller
than the mass of the membrane Mmem . Some microorganisms have smooth surfaces (Fig. 1b) while some other
microorganisms have pili (hairlike structures) on their
surfaces (Fig. 1c). For simplicity, it will be better to use
microorganisms with smooth surfaces. One way to put
a microorganism on top of an electromechanical membrane is to spray a small amount of microorganisms to
air in a sealed glove box, and wait one microorganism
to settle down on the electromechanical membrane. The
process can be monitored with an optical microscope.
After being cooled down to a cryogenic temperature, the

microorganism can be exposed to high vacuum without
sublimation of the water ice. Techniques developed in
cryo-electron microscopy can be utilized here [43]. The
sublimation rate of water ice is only about 0.3 monolayers/hour at 128 K with a sublimation energy of 0.45 eV
[52]. The sublimation of water ice can be safely ignored
at millikelvin temperatures.
At millikelvin temperatures, a frozen microorganism
will be in a hard and brittle state like a glass. It will
be stuck on the membrane due to van der Waals force
or even stronger chemical bonds. The pull-off force between a 1 µm sphere and a flat surface due to van der
Waals force is on the order 100 nN [53], which is about
107 times larger than the gravitational force on a 1 µm
particle. So the microorganism will move together with
the membrane as long as there is a good contact between
them. The oscillation frequency of the membrane oscillator will change by roughly −Ωm m/(2Mmem ), where Ωm
is the intrinsic oscillation frequency of the membrane.
The exact frequency shift depends on the position of the
microorganism on the membrane. Nonetheless, this frequency shift will be small and will not significantly affect
the ground state cooling or other state control of the
membrane when m/Mmem << 1.
The change of the quality factor Q of the membrane oscillator due to an attached small microorganism
(m/Mmem << 1) will also be negligible. For a frozen
bacterium with a smooth surface (Fig. 1b), the lowest internal vibration frequency can be estimated by the speed
of sound in ice divided by half of its size. So the internal vibration modes of the main body will be larger than
1 GHz for a bacterium smaller than 1 µm. This is much
larger than the frequency of the center-of-mass motion
of the electromechanical membrane which is about 10
MHz. Thus these internal vibration modes of the main
body of a bacterium will not couple to the center-of-mass
vibration of the membrane. The situation will be a little complex for bacteria that have pili on their surfaces

(Fig. 1c) [54]. For a very thin and long pilus, it is possible
that its vibration frequency to be on the same order or
even smaller than the center-of-mass vibration frequency
of the electromechanical membrane. However, because
the quality factors of both the pili and electromechanical membrane are expected to be very high at milikelvin
temperatures, it is unlikely that their frequencies matches
within their linewidths to affect the ground state cooling
of the center-of-mass mode of the membrane. One can
also avoid this problem by embedding the pili in water
ice.

III. CENTER-OF-MASS MOTION: COOLING,
SUPERPOSITION AND TELEPORTATION

We assume the frequency of the center-of-mass motion
of the microorganism and the membrane together to be
ωm , which is almost the same as Ωm . The motion of the
membrane alters the frequency ωc of the superconducting
LC resonator. The frequency ωc can be approximated
with ωc (x) = ω0 + Gx, where x is the displacement of
membrane, and G = ∂ωc /∂x. The parametric interaction
Hamiltonian has the form HI = Ga† aˆ
x = Gˆ
nx0 (am +
a†m ), where a (am ) and a† (a†m ) are the creation and
annihilation operators for LC (mechanical) resonator, n
ˆ
is the photon number operator, and x0 =
/2Mmem ωm
is the zero point fluctuation for mechanical mode. We
denote the single-photon coupling constant g0 = Gx0 .
In order to enhance the effective coupling between
LC resonator and mechanical oscillator, the LC resonator is strongly driven with frequency ωd and Rabi frequency Ωd .The corresponding Hamiltonian reads Hd =
Ωd −iωd t
a + h.c.. The detuning between the driving mi2 e
crowave source and the LC resonator is ∆ = ωd − ω0 .
The steady state amplitude can be approximated as
α = Ωd /(2∆ + iκ), where κ is the decay rate of the LC
resonator. We assume that the steady state amplitude α
is much larger than 1. We expand the Hamiltonian with
a − α, and the total Hamiltonian reads
H = ∆a† a + ωm a†m am + g(a† + a)(a†m + am ), (1)
where g = αg0 . The detuning can be freely chosen to satisfy the requirements of different applications. In order to
cool the membrane resonator, we choose ∆ = −ωm . By
using rotating wave approximation under the condition
that ωm ≫ g, we get the effective equation as [55]
Heff = ga† am + gaa†m .

(2)

In order to cool the membrane oscillation to the ground
state, the system should fulfill the sideband limit ωm ≫
κ, γm , where γm is the decay rate of mechanical mode of
the whole system [56, 57]. γm will be almost the same
as the decay rate Γm of the mechanical mode of the electromechanical membrane alone when the frequencies of
internal modes of the microorganism do not match the

4
frequency of the electromechanical membrane. The master equation for the system is
ρ˙ = −i[Hef f , ρ]/ + La ρ + Lam ρ,

(3)

where the generators are defined by La ρ = κDa ρ,
¯ m γm Da†m ρ, and the nota¯ m )γm Dam ρ + n
Lam ρ = (1 + n
tion of the generators has Lindblad form Dx ρ = 2xρx† −
x† xρ − ρx† x. In the limit that κ ≫ g, we can adiabatically eliminate the a mode, and get the effective master
equation
ρ˙ = Lam ρ + L′am ρ,

(4)

where L′am = κ′ Dam , and κ′ = g 2 /κ. We define the total
¯ ′m γ ′ Da†m ,
¯ ′m )γ ′ Dam + n
generator L = Lam + L′am = (1 + n
′

′
′
where γ = γ + κ , and n
¯m = n
¯ m γ/γ . As long as κ′ >
γ, the steady state mean phonon number of mechanical
resonator n
¯ ′m is less than 1, which is in the quantum
regime. As a bacterium or virus are attached on the
top of membrane, it is also cooled down to the quantum
regime.
Once the mechanical mode is cooled down to the quantum regime, we can prepare the mechanical superposition
state by the method of quantum state transfer between
mechanical and LC resonators. For example, we can
√ first
generate the superposition state |φ0 = (|0 + |1 )/ 2 for
LC mode a with assistant of a superconducting qubit.
Here |0 and |1 are vacuum and Fock state with 1 photon
of mode a. Then, we turn on the beam-splitter Hamiltonian Eq. (2) between a and am . After the interaction
time t = π/g, the mechanical mode will be in the superposition state |φ0 . Here we suppose that the strong
coupling condition g > n
¯ m γ, κ fulfills. Therefore, the
coherence of the superposition state |φ0 can maintain
during the state transfer.
The quantum state of the center-of-mass motion of
a microorganism can also be teleported to another microorganism using a superconducting circuit. Quantum
teleportation based on superconducting circuits has been
demonstrated recently [36]. We consider two remote microorganisms, which are attached to two separate mechanical resonators integrated with LC resonators. They
are connected by a superconducting circuit as demonstrated in Ref. [36]. They are initially cooled down to
the motional ground states. We use the ground state and
the first Fock state |1 of both mechanical and LC resonators as the qubit states. The mechanical mode am1 of
the first microorganism and mechanical resonator is prepared to a superposition state |ψ1 = α|0 m1 + β|1 m1 ,
where α and β are arbitrary and fulfill |α|2 + |β|2 = 1.
The LC resonator modes a1 and a2 are
√ prepared to the
entangled state (|0 1 |1 2 + |1 1 |0 2 )/ 2, through quantum state transfer, or post selection [55]. Then by transferring the state a2 to the mechanical mode am2 of the
second microorganism and mechanical oscillator, the LC
mode a1 entangles with mechanical mode am2 . This entanglement can be used as a resource for teleporting the

state in mechanical mode am1 to the mechanical mode
am2 [58].
To do this task, we need to perform Bell measurements
on mode a1 and am1 , which can be accomplished by a
CPHASE gate between a1 and am1 , and Hadamard gates
on a1 and am1 [36]. In order to realize the CPHASE gate,
we tune the driving detuning ∆ − ωm = δ ≪ ωm . The
effective Hamiltonian between a1 and am1 becomes
†

†
†
Hef
f = δa1 a1 + ga am + gaam

(5)

In the limit δ ≫ g, we get an effective photon-phonon
coupling Hamiltonian by adopting second order perturbation method,
Hpp =

g2 †
a a1 a†m1 am1 .
δ 1

(6)

By turning on the Hamiltonian (6) for time t =
πδ/g 2 , the CPHASE gate between a1 and am1 accomplishes. The state of the system becomes |Ψ =
(α|0 m1 |0 1 |1 m2√
+ α|0 m1 |1 1 |0 m2 + β|1 m1 |0 1 |1 m2 −
β|1 m1 |1 1 |0 m2 ) 2. Then we perform two Hadamard
gates on a1 and m1 modes, and project measurements
on the basis |0 and |1 . There are four different output {00, 01, 10, 11}, which are one-to-one mapping to the
four Bell measurement basis. Based on the output, we
can perform the specific local operation on the mode am2
and recover the original state α|0 + β|1 .
IV. INTERNAL ELECTRON SPINS:
ENTANGLEMENT AND DETECTION

The internal states of a microorganism can also be
prepared in superposition states and entangled with
the center-of-mass motion of the microorganism at millikelvin temperatures. A good internal state of a microorganism is the electron spin of a radical or transition metal
ion in the microorganism. Radicals are produced during
metabolism or by radiation damage. Some proteins in
microorganisms contain transition metal ions, which also
have non-zero electron spins can be used to create quantum superposition states. The smallest amino acid in
proteins is glycine. The electron spin of a glycine radical
−
˙
NH+
has a relaxation time T1 = 0.31s and a
3 CHCOO
phase coherent time TM = 6µs at 4.2 K [40]. As shown in
Fig. 4 of Ref. [40], the phase coherent time increases dramatically when the temperature decreases below 10 K.
So it will be much longer at millikelvin temperatures.
Moreover, universal dynamic decoupling can be used to
increase the coherent time TM by several orders, eventually limited by the relaxation time T1 [59]. Thus we
expect the coherent time of the electron spin of a glycine
radical to be much longer than 1 ms at millikevin temperatures. The electron spin of some other radicals or
defects in a frozen microorganism may have even longer
coherence time at millikelvin temperatures.

FIG. 2. Scheme to couple the internal states of a microorganism to the center-of-mass motion of the microorganism with
a magnetic gradient. A ferromagnetic tip mounted on a rigid
cantilever produces a strong magnetic gradient. A RF current
iRF passing through a superconducting microwire generates
a BRF that excites an electron spin in the microorganism.
Different from a typical MRFM apparatus, the cantilever is
rigid, while the substrate (membrane) of the microorganism
is flexible to oscillate in this setup.

a magnetic tip is similar to the scheme used in MRFM.
Recently, single electron spin detection with a MRFM
[60], and nanoscale magnetic resonance imaging of the
1
H nuclear spin of tobacco mosaic viruses [42] have been
realized. A MRFM using a superconducting quantum
interference device (SQUID)-based cantilever detection
at 30 mK has also been demonstrated [61].
As shown in Fig. 2, in order to couple the internal spins
states of a microorganism to the center of mass motion of
the microorganism, a magnetic field gradient is applied.
Above the microorganism, there is a ferromagnetic tip
mounted on a rigid cantilever, which produces a magnetic field B with a large gradient. In a microorganism,
there are usually more than one radical that has unpaired
electrons. Because the magnetic field is inhomogeneous,
the energy splitting between electron spin states depends
on the relative position between an electron and the ferromagnetic tip. The Hamiltonian for N unpaired electron
spins reads
N

He =
i

gs µB Si (xi ) · B(xi )

(7)

where gs ≃ 2, µB is Bohr magneton, xi is the position of
the ith electrons, Si is the spin operator for ith electrons
spins. To make sure that the electron spin of interest
is initially in the ground state at 10 mK, we suppose
that the electron spin level spacings are larger than 500
MHz, which requires a magnetic field larger than 18 mT
at the position of the radical. Because the finite size of

the microorganism, the magnetic field at the position of
membrane can be smaller than 10 mT, which is the critical magnetic field of aluminium. So the membrane can be
made of aluminium [17] if necessary. However, superconducting materials (e.g. Nb) with a relative large critical
magnetic field will be better for making the membrane
and the RF wire [20, 61].
The oscillation of membrane induces a time-varying
magnetic field on electrons in the microorganism. We
define the single phonon induced frequency shift λ =
gs µB |Gm |x′o / , where x′0 is the zero field fluctuation of
microorganism, and Gm = ∂B(x1 )/∂x1 . Here x′0 is different from x0 of membrane. Usually, x′0 is two times
larger than x0 when the microorganism is at the center
of the membrane. Here we assume that the magnetic
gradient is (un)parallel to both the magnetic field B(x1 )
and the mechanical oscillation. The z axis is defined
along the direction of B(x1 ). We apply a microwave driving with frequency ωd′ , which is close to the electron 1’s
level spacing ω1 = gµB B(x1 ). The Rabi frequency is Ω′d ,
which is tuned to near the mechanical mode frequency
ωm . In all electrons, the level spacing ω2 = gµB B(x2 )
of the 2nd electron is closest to the 1st one. Under
the condition that gs µb |B(x1 ) − B(x2 )| ≫ |Ω|, we have
|Ω| ≪ |ω1 − ω2 |. Therefore, only electron 1 is driven by
the microwave. We can neglect the effects of all other
free electrons in microorganism. The Hamiltonian contains electron 1 and the motion of the membrane and the
microorganism reads [62]
Ω′
1
∆e
σz + d σx + λ(am + a†m )σz ,
2
2
2
(8)
where ∆e = ωd′ − ω1 . We rotate the electron spin axis
to diagonalize it, which has the effective level splitting
ωef f = ∆2e + Ω′2
d.
We first need to identify the position and frequency of
an electron spin in the microorganism. We can search it
by scanning the magnetic tip above the microorganism
[60]. The microwaves driving the LC resonator and the
electron spins are turned on with Rabi frequencies Ωd
and Ω′d , and frequencies ωd and ωd′ . Once the electron
spin resonance (ESR) reaches ωef f = ωm , the excitation
of the electron spin could be efficiently transferred to the
LC mode a, mediated with the mechanical mode am ,
and decay finally. We will observe the ESR signal on
the output spectrum of the LC mode. Then we want to
tune the ∆e to be zero and maximize the spin-phonon
coupling strength. First, we scan the frequency of the
microwave on the electron spins, under the specific Rabi
frequency Ω′d . The ESR peaks appear in pair with the
center frequency ω1 . Then we tune the frequency of the
microwave drive on electron ωd′ = ω1 , the ESR should
have only one peak. In this way, we find the resonant
frequency ω1 of the electron 1. The magnetic field B
near the electron can be got from the Eq. (7). Then we
can identify the relative location between the electron 1
and the magnetic tip. This setup can also detect nuclear
spins with lower sensitivity, which has broad applications
HeM = ωm a†m am +

6
[35, 42, 63].
Let’s suppose that ∆e has been tuned to be zero, and
denote the operators σ± = σz ± iσy , The qubit is defined
on the eigenstates of σx . In the limit λ ≪ ωm , |Ω′d |, we
set Ω′d = ωm and the effective interaction Hamiltonian
between electrons and the motion of microorganism is
HI = λσ+ a + h.c..

(9)

Here the rotating wave approximation is used. We may
also set Ω′d = −ωm , and the effective Hamiltonian has
the form
HI′ = λσ+ a† + h.c..

(10)

Recently, a mechanical decay rate as low as γm = 2π×9.2
Hz was realized in a similar electromechanical membrane
oscillator [64], which will be even better. The electron
spin decay and dephase can be both less than kHz [40,
59], which is also much less than λ. Therefore, strong
coupling condition is fulfilled. We can generate entangled
state and transfer quantum states between electron spin 1
and the mechanical mode am with either Hamiltonian (9)
or (10) [65, 66]. Thus this setup not only can detect the
existence of single electron spins like conventional MRFM
[60], but also can coherently manipulate and detect the
quantum states of electron spins. It enables some isolated
electron spins that could not be read out with optical or
electrical methods to be used as quantum memory for
quantum information.

If we use the parameters in Ref. [17], ωm = 2π × 10
MHz, Mmem = 48 pg, we have x0 = 4.2 × 10−15 m,
and x′0 ≃ 2x0 = 8.4 × 10−15 m. Under the magnetic
gradient |Gm | = 107 T/m, the single phonon induced
frequency shift λ = gs µB |Gm |x′o / = 14.8 kHz. The
mechanical decay rate γm = 2π × 32 Hz. The effective
mechanical decay under temperature 10 mK is n
¯ m γm ≃
20 × 2π × 32Hz = 4.0 kHz, which is much less than λ.
