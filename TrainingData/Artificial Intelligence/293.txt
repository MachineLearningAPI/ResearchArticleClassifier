Abstract- A new type of floating breakwaters (FBs) is introduced by changing the longitudinal section of œÄ-shaped
FBs into a stepwise shape. The hydrodynamic performance of so-called step floating breakwaters (SFBs) is
evaluated through 144 experiments on SFBs of different types as well as œÄ-shaped FBs. Initially, using the
experimental data, the performance of SFBs was evaluated by comparison against œÄ-shaped FBs with similar width
and draft depths. The experimental data were then used to develop a model for predicting transmission coefficient of
SFBs through Support Vector Machines. The accuracy of this model was assessed through statistical indices like
Correlation Coefficient and Root Mean Square Error and was found to be satisfactory. The experimentally obtained
data which were further extended using the developed model were utilized for assessing the performance of SFBs
when various geometrical and hydrodynamic parameters changed.
Keywords: floating breakwater, transmission coefficient, physical modeling, Support vector machine.

1. Introduction
Floating breakwaters (FBs) have been specially regarded in recent years by marine industry
specialists for protecting beaches and marine structures against invasion of short period waves. FBs
provide numerous advantages over fixed breakwaters including better compatibility with the environment,
mobility and easier installation, lower manufacture and construction costs and enhanced applicability in
deep waters and in areas with loose sea bed conditions.
The transmission coefficient (Ct) parameter is usually used for measuring the efficiency of a FB and
is calculated through Eq. 1. In this equation Hi and Ht are the heights of incident and transmitted waves
respectively.

The efficiency of FBs with different shapes has been investigated by many researchers (Brebner and
Ofuya, 1968, Fugazza and Natale, 1988, Murali and Mani, 1997, Mastunaga et al., 2002, Liang et al.,
2004, Dong et al., 2008, Ozeren et al., 2008, etc) addressing various hydrodynamic conditions. A review
of these researches show that the shape of FB can influentially affect its performance. Pontoon FBs are
among the standard shapes used for manufacture of these breakwaters. The parameters affecting the
performance of Pontoon FBs have been extensively studied in recent years (Sutko and Haden, 1974,
Drimer et al., 1991, Tolba, 1998, Koutandos et al., 2005). The results of these studies have revealed that
the width and draft depth of Pontoon FBs are too important regarding their efficiency. Further researches
on Pontoon FBs have been dedicated to introduction of œÄ-shaped FBs (with increased draft depth), double
and multiple FBs (with increased width) and a combination of them while the efficiency of the proposed
FBs was compared against Pontoon FBs (Koftis and Prinos, 2006, Gesraha et al., 2006, Abdolali et al.,
2011, Pena et al., 2011). These researches unveiled that addition of fins to Pontoon FBs and changing
293-1

them to œÄ-shaped FBs leads to an efficiency increase. Also, double and multiple FBs have been shown to
provide remarkably better performances than single FBs. The manufacture and maintenance costs of these
FBs is, however, considerably higher than single FBs.
On the other hand, soft computation techniques such as artificial neural network (ANN), fuzzy logic
(FL), supporting vector machine (SVM) and other optimization algorithms have been recently
incorporated in engineering problems. Nevertheless, few researches have utilized these techniques for
predicting transmission coefficient of FBs. Patil et al. (2011) used adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system
(ANFIS) for predicting transmission coefficient of pipe multi-layer FBs. In their study the
appropriateness of ANFIS method for predicting transmission coefficient was under consideration. Later
on they combined SVM regression and genetic algorithm (GA), for predicting the same parameter (Patil
et al., 2012). In their study, the utilization of GA for optimizing the vector machine parameters are
examined and base on obtained results it was concluded that the GA-SVM algorithm is useful for the
intended purpose.
The effect of step addition in longitudinal section of œÄ-shaped FBs is studied here. In this regard,
hydrodynamic performance of various types of SFBs and œÄ-shaped FBs with similar widths and draft
depths was evaluated, initially, using physical modeling method. A model was then developed for
predicting transmission coefficient of SFBs using experimentally collected data and SVM method. The
developed model was, subsequently, used for investigating the performance of SFBs in wider ranges of
parameters than those considered in the experimental program.

2. Methodology
2. 1. Experimental Equipment
The length, width and depth of the flume used in this study are, respectively, equal to 11, 0.3 and 0.4
meters. The flume is made up of Plexiglas sheets with 1 cm thickness. The used flap type wave generator
was able to generate regular waves with 1.3 to 3 second periods that were less than 18 cm high. At the
end of the flume, a wave absorber made up of porous wooden fibers was installed to prevent wave‚Äôs
reflection. The water surface level was measured using wave gauges installed around the breakwater. Two
wave gauges were installed at the sea side which were responsible for measuring time series and
separating incident and reflective waves, while another was used at the beach side for gauging the
transmitted waves. Accuracy of these wave gauges was 1mm and sample frequency was up to 100 Hz.
Fig. 1 shows the flume and the used equipment from an overall view.

2. 2. FB models properties and test conditions
Four different models of SFBs and œÄ-shaped FB with similar widths and draft depths are considered
in this study. All models are made up of 6 mm thick Plexiglas sheets and their drafts have been adjusted
by placing weights inside them. Geometrical characteristics of different models are illustrated in Fig. 2.

293-2

The width and draft depths of all models are selected to be 35 and 14 cm respectively. In order to
assess the effect of relative draft (ratio of draft depth to water depth) on the performance of SFBs, all
models have been tested in three 30, 25 and 20 cm water depths. Wave periods have been set to vary
between 1.3 and 2.2 s and the height of incident waves varied from 2 to 8 cm.

Manufacturing the SFBs will clearly consume less material than production of œÄ-shaped FBs. The
material weight reduction percentage provided by models B, C and D are, respectively, 4%, 7% and 11%
in compare with model A.
Experimental FB models are allow to move in the vertical direction (Heave motion). To provide this
freedom, four aluminium rails connected to the flume sides have been used. These rails could restrain the
horizontal movement of the models along with its rotation about the longitudinal axis.
2. 3. Support Vector Machine (SVM) method
To assess the performance of SFBs in a more extended range of parameters than that considered in
the experiments, the SVM method is utilized. The SVM method is a combination of support vector
classification (SVC) and support vector regression (SVR) that provide one of the most accurate and most
powerful data mining algorithms. The SVM concept was founded by Vapink (1995). The theoretical basis
of the SVM algorithms is formed by statistical learning theory. A superior characteristic of these
algorithms is their independence from data dimensions. Besides the strong mathematical reliance on
statistical learning theory, successful application of SVMs in scientific and practical fields have been
approved.
SVMs are learning systems that use a hypothesis space that is called feature space and contains linear
functions with large dimensions. A learner machine is responsible for finding a continuous function with
real values that can accurately predict output values in correspondence to each input value. This system is
trained using a learning algorithm that relies on optimization theory.
2. 4. Performance Evaluation Method for Models
The performance of the SVM method in predicting transmission coefficient of the models has been
evaluated using a number of commonly used statistical indices. The correlation coefficient (CC) and root
mean square error (RMSE) are utilized for this purpose which are defined as follows.

3. Discussion
The results obtained for various studied models are illustrated in Fig. 3. In this figure the variations
of transmission coefficients versus Hi/L is shown, with Hi being the height of incident wave and L the
wave length. According to the figure, all studied SFBs have shown better performances than œÄ-shaped
FBs with similar widths and draft depths. This observation reveals that introduction of steps in
longitudinal section of œÄ-shaped FBs leads to an improved performance of FBs in addition to the reduced
material used in their manufacturing. This figure also show that models with larger step widths have
exhibited better hydrodynamic performances than those with smaller step widths. From above
comparison, it can be concluded that increasing steps width will positively affect the hydrodynamic
performance of SFBs.

As previously mentioned, the SVM method has been incorporated, in this study, for predicting the
transmission coefficient values beyond the parameter ranges considered in the tests in order to provide
more extended performance evaluations. For this purpose, the dimensionless parameters Hi/L (previously
described), B/L (with B being the lower width of the breakwater), dr/d (with dr being breakwater‚Äôs draft
depth and d the water depth) and S/B (with S being the step width) have been chosen as the input
parameters of SVM model and the transmission coefficient parameter (Ct) has been used as the output.
Also, 75% of the experimental data have been used for training the models and the remaining 25% have
been addressed for evaluating its performance in predicting the transmission coefficient.
In order to train the SVM model, various function kernels such as polynomial, linear and radial basis
function (RBF) have been examined and the RBF kernel was found to provide the most accurate
293-4

predictions. The SVM model has two parameters C and Œµ and the RBF kernel function depends on the
parameter Œ≥. These parameters should be determined by the user and the accuracy of the model is highly
sensitive to their values. A search algorithm has been utilized in this study for selecting the values of
these parameters so that the value of RMSE index computed based on the measured and predicted values
could be minimized. The ultimate values selected for C, Œµ and Œ≥ parameters mentioned above are 100,
0.005 and 0.85 respectively.
After selecting the optimal values for the above parameters, the SVM model was trained using the
training data set and its accuracy was assessed using the test data set. Table 1 presents the evaluation
parameters of SVM model. Fig. 4 draws a comparison between the transmission coefficient values
measured through the tests and those predicted via the proposed model.

The results depicted in Fig. 4 and tabulated in Table 1 approve the superiority of the predictions
performed by the developed model as the comparison between predicted and measured data suggests.
This model is, therefore, said to be suitably capable of predicting the transmission coefficient of SFBs and
is employed for extending the experimental observations. Figures 5, 6 and 7 present these data and are
used for evaluating the performance of SFBs in a more extended range of parameters.
Fig. 5 depicts the variations in transmission coefficient of SFBs versus the values of the B/L
parameter.

The various curves shown in this figure are related to different values of the S/B parameter.
According to this figure, the transmission coefficient of SFBs decreases as the B/L parameter increases. In
addition, an increase to the S/B parameter has led to an improvement to the SFBs performance. The
degree of this improvement is not, however, constant and increases with increase of B/L parameter. The
figure‚Äôs curves also show that changing the dr/d parameter does not noticeably affect the distance
between different branches. Therefore, it can also be concluded that increasing the S/B parameter is more
effective in larger dr/d values according to the larger performance improvement percentage provided.
The graphs depicted in Fig. 6 show the changes in transmission coefficient of SFBs against dr/d
parameter.

The various branches present in this figure show different values of S/B parameter. According to this
figure, an increase in the dr/d leads to reduction of transmission coefficient of SFBs. Again, elevation of
the S/B parameter results in an improvement to the performance of SFBs. According to this figure, the
distance between various branches remains almost unchanged by changing the value of the dr/d parameter
leading to the conclusion that the effect of S/B parameter is more pronounced in larger values of dr/d
parameter. Ultimately, comparing the various graphs presented in Fig. 6, it can be stated that increasing
the period of incident waves causes the different graphs to get closer which in turn decreases the effect of
S/B parameter.
The graphs presented in Fig. 7 illustrate the hydrodynamic performance of SFBs when characteristics
of the incident waves change. This figure‚Äôs graphs depict the changes in transmission coefficient of SFBs
due to changes in the period (T) of waves. The various branches presented in this figure are related to
different heights of incident waves (Hi). According to the graphs in this figure, with reduction of incident
waves‚Äô period and increase of their height, the transmission coefficient of SFBs is decreased. Comparison
of different graphs reveal that, with increase of S/B parameter, the graphs‚Äô slopes are elevated and the
distance between them is remained nearly constant. Therefore, reducing the period and increasing the
height of incident waves yields in a performance improvement of SFBs whose percentage is elevated with
increase of S/B ratio. In other words, the effect of S/B parameter is more pronounced in case of waves
with shorter periods and larger heights.

4. Conclusion
Physical modeling method was used in this article to assess hydrodynamic performance of step
floating breakwaters (SFBs) and to draw comparison between the performance of these floating
breakwaters (FBs) and œÄ-shaped FBs with similar widths and draft depths. The support vector machine
(SVM) method was subsequently used on the experimental data to develop a model for predicting
transmission coefficient of SFBs and was utilized for further extending the obtained experimental data.
The following conclusions can be highlighted from this study.

Changing the longitudinal section of œÄ-shaped FBs to a stepwise shape leads to their
hydrodynamic performance improvement in addition to the material usage reduction.
The SVM method provides a satisfactory means for predicting the transmission coefficient of
SFBs.
Increasing the parameters B/L, dr/d and S/B as well as reducing the period and increasing the
height of incident waves lead to reduction of transmission coefficient of SFBs.
The effect of S/B parameter on hydrodynamic performance of SFBs is more pronounced in
larger values of parameters B/L and dr/d and in subjection to waves with shorter periods and
larger heights.
