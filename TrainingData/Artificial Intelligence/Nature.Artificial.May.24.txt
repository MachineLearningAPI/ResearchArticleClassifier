Artificial intelligence joins hunt for human–animal
diseases
Model predicts that the midwestern United States and Central Asia are at high risk for
outbreaks of rodent-borne pathogens.

The Northern flying squirrel carries diseases that can pass from animals to humans.

Lyme disease, Ebola and malaria all developed in animals before making the leap to infect humans.
Predicting when such a 'zoonotic' disease will spark an outbreak remains difficult, but a new study
suggests that artificial intelligence could give these efforts a boost.
A computer model that incorporates machine learning can pinpoint, with 90% accuracy, rodent

species that are known to harbour pathogens that can spread to humans, researchers report this
week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 1. The model also identified more than
150 species that are likely to be disease reservoirs but have yet to be confirmed as such.
Central Asia and the midwestern United States were among the regions with the greatest
concentrations of potential reservoir species. That surprised lead author Barbara Han, an ecologist at
the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies in Millbrook, New York. “I had thought, 'Didn't we discover
everything here already?'” she says.
Han and her colleagues began by training their model to identify
characteristics that are common to the 217 rodent species that are
known to carry zoonotic diseases. They set the model to analyse
databases of animal traits, such as species' geographic ranges,

Then the researchers used their model to analyse the disease-transmitting potential of the world's
2,277 rodent species. They identified more than 150 species — including some voles, squirrels and
guinea pigs — that are not known reservoirs of zoonotic diseases but seem likely to be, based on
factors identified by the model.
Felicia Keesing, a biologist at Bard College in New York, likes the study's use of animal traits such as
litter size or frequency of reproduction to identify disease risks. That could lead to more targeted
disease surveillance than previous work that focused on the locations of past outbreaks. “We can
predict not just where, but in what" species the next illness could arise, she says.
Sophisticated machine learning is beginning to be used more widely across ecology. Such work has
uncovered hidden patterns in everything from the dispersal of invasive plants2 to the flight paths of
birds3.
Studying ecology mostly used to be about going into the field and gathering data, says Reuben Keller,

increasingly learning how to deal with all the data we’ve gathered in rigorous ways”.

To the editor:
Non-clinical profiles used in the identification of diseases
The Deng's editorial [Artificial intelligence joins hunt for human-animal diseases, Nature],
examines a computer model that uses the census of rodent species, for the prediction of
epidemics in humans (1), and showing the relevance of the participation of other species in
its spread. Also previous works suggest considering migratory routes of birds and fish (2) in
the modeling of disease outbreaks.
Including a large number of variables (3) in the predictive models leads us to consider the
"core" the method, since the number of variables makes it unfeasible the use of deterministic
models, however, the stochastic models (4), are not affected by this increase, and their
computational implementation use distributed computation. For the foregoing reasons we
believe that this last scheme should be used preferably in the recreation of epidemic
outbreaks, which use a large number of variables
