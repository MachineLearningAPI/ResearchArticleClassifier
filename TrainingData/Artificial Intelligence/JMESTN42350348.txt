Abstract— This paper presents a control
strategy for power management in standalone
solar photovoltaic and wind hybrid power system
based on Artificial intelligence techniques. Solar
and wind energy are utilized as a primary sources
of energy and a battery unit is considered as
storage element to meet out the load demand in
case of insufficient power generation from
primary
sources.
To
ensure
efficiency
optimization of sources the Adaptive Neural Fuzzy
Inference System (ANFIS) strategy is employed to
achieve the maximum power point (MPP) for
photovoltaic (PV) panels and the Fuzzy Logic
Control (FLC) strategy is employed to achieve the
MPP of wind turbine. The fuzzy logic controller is
developed to manage the power flow between the
hybrid power sources and other devices in the
system. The controller choose the optimal
operating mode of power sources ensuring the
continuous supply of the load and maintaining the
battery state of charge (SOC) at acceptable levels.
Proposed controller provides effective utilization
of sources and minimizing usage of battery hence
improves battery life. A complete mathematical
modeling and MATLAB/Simulink model for the
proposed system is implemented to track the
system performance. Simulation results are
presented to show the effectiveness of the
proposed control system.

INTRODUCTION
Social, economic and industrial growth of any
country requires energy. Fossil fuels are the major
energy sources but still when over consumption takes
place lead to disastrous effects such as air pollution
and et cetera. Burning of fossil fuels releases harmful
gases that have severe consequences on the
habitats, also affect human health. They are nonrenewable sources of energy as they are derived from
pre-historic fossils and are no longer available if once
used. Their source is limited and they are depleting at
a faster rate. Renewable energy generation is the best
option for protecting environment as well as solution
towards the limited availability of fossil fuel.
The increasing of energy demand, high energy
prices, as well as the increasing concern on over

environmental aspects, health and climate change,
has attracted many researchers and communities to
move into alternative energy studies. Many studies
have been done to make use of renewable energy
sources (e.g. solar, biogas, wind, etc) that are stand
alone. Among these, solar and wind energy are two of
the most promising renewable power generation
technologies. Solar power or wind power is normally
used by remote off-grid areas where mains electricity
supply is unavailable.
The disadvantage of standalone power systems
using renewable energy is that the availability of
renewable energy sources has daily and some have
seasonal patterns which results in difficulties in
regulating the output power based on the load. For
example, the daily wind speed is not constant and
solar irradiation cut-off at night and cloudy days, thus,
the solar and wind system have low reliability and
cannot supply the load throughout a day. Since
neither the solar power nor wind power are available
constantly throughout the day, month or year,
exclusive solar or wind power systems cannot be
used on standalone basis for electrical installations
which require constant guaranteed power. Alternative
to this is the installation of hybrid energy systems.
The major limitation for these hybrid systems is the
control
requirement
for
optimal
efficiency.
Conventional
control
algorithms
require
a
mathematical model for the dynamic system to be
controlled. The mathematical model is then used to
construct a controller. In many practical situations,
however, it is not always feasible to obtain an
accurate mathematical model of the controlled
system. Artificial intelligent (AI) control offers a way of
dealing with modeling problems by implementing
linguistic, non-formal control laws derived from expert
knowledge [1]. Fuzzy logic control systems have
benefits of replicating all desired features of human
input, while maintaining all the advantages of closedloop automation control. One of the major problems in
the use of the fuzzy logic control is the difficulty of
choice and design of membership functions to suit a
given problem. A systematic procedure for choosing
the type of membership function and the ranges of
variables in the universe of discourse is still not
available. Tuning of the fuzzy controller by trial and
error is often necessary to get a satisfactory
performance. However, the neural networks have the
capability of identifying the characteristic features of a
system that can be extracted from the input-output

data. This learning capability of the neural network
can be combined with the control capabilities of a
fuzzy logic system resulting in a neuro-fuzzy inference
system [1].
In this paper, MATLAB/Simulink software is used
to model and develop controller that optimize energy
efficiency and also manage the power distribution on
PV-Wind hybrid system. The Adaptive Neural Fuzzy
Inference System is used to estimate a reference
voltage of a PV system which corresponds to the
maximum power that can be produce by the PV
system. The FLC is used to develop the MPPT of
Wind turbine. Finally the FLC is designed in such a
way it selects the best available energy source(s) and
protects the battery against overcharge and excessive
discharge.
Modeling of Hybrid System Components
In this section, the dynamic simulation model for
the system is described. The system consists of
several units, PV power and wind power units as
primary sources of energy, battery bank unit as
auxiliary source of energy, dc-dc and dc-ac
converters, load unit and control unit. The function of
controller unit is to ensure the management of the
power, which is delivered by the hybrid system to
satisfy the load and to charge the battery. The inverter
unit is used to convert the DC generated power from
renewable energy sources to feed the load with the
required AC power. The excessive charge from the
battery will be dumped to the dump load unit. The
dump load in this case is the battery storage which
can then be used to supply power to the load in case
of insufficient power generated by primary sources.
The block diagram describing the system components
is shown in Fig. 1. The mathematical models
describing the dynamic behavior of each of these
components are given below.

assessment. The following section describes the
mathematical model for estimating the power output of
PV. The equivalent circuit of a PV cell is shown in Fig
2. It includes a current source, a diode, a series
resistance and a shunt resistance [2], [4].

Fig. 2 The equivalent circuit of a PV cell
The current source Iph represents the cell
photocurrent. Rsh and Rs are the intrinsic shunt and
series resistances of the cell, respectively. Usually the
value of Rsh is very large and that of Rs is very small,
hence they may be neglected to simplify the analysis.
PV cells are grouped in larger units called PV
modules which are further interconnected in a parallelseries configuration to form PV arrays. The
photovoltaic panel can be modeled mathematically as
given in equations below:

The Wind Turbine

𝜌𝐴𝑉𝑤 =

Currently two types of configuration for wind
turbine exist, which is the vertical-axis wind turbine
(VAWT) configuration and the widely used horizontalaxis wind turbine (HAWT) configuration. HAWT have
the ability to collect maximum amount of wind energy
for time of day and season and their blades can be
adjusted to avoid high wind storm. Wind turbines
operate in two modes namely constant or variable
speed. For a constant speed turbine, the rotor turns at
constant angular speed regardless of wind variations.
One advantage of this mode is that it eliminates
expensive power electronics such as inverters and
converters. Its disadvantage however, is that it
constrains rotor speed so that the turbine cannot
operate at its peak efficiency in all wind speeds. For
this reason a constant wind speed turbine produces
less energy at low wind speeds than does a variable
wind speed turbine which is designed to operate at a
rotor speed proportional to the wind speed below its
rated wind speed [3]. The output power or torque of a
wind turbine is determined by several factors. Among
them are (i) turbine speed, (ii) rotor blade tilt, (iii) rotor
blade pitch angle (iv) size and shape of turbine, (v)
area of turbine, (vi) rotor geometry whether it is a
HAWT or a VAWT, (vii) and wind speed. A
relationship between the output power and the various
variables constitute the mathematical model of the
wind turbine. In this paper a model describing HAWT
is proposed.
For an object having mass m and velocity 𝑉 under
a constant acceleration, the kinetic energy 𝑊𝑤 is
given by
1

𝑊𝑤 = 𝑚𝑣 2

(5)

2

The power 𝑃𝑤 in the wind is given by the rate of
change of kinetic energy, i.e
𝑃𝑤 =

𝑑𝑊𝑤

1 𝑑𝑚
2 𝑑𝑡

𝑉𝑤 2

(6)

But the mass flow rate is given by
𝑑𝑚
𝑑𝑡

= 𝜌𝐴𝑉𝑤

(7)

Where 𝐴 is the swept area of the turbine, ρ is the
density of air. With this expression equation (7)
becomes
1

𝑃𝑤 = 𝜌𝐴𝑉𝑤 3
2

(8)

The actual mechanical power 𝑃𝑤 extracted by the
rotor blades in watts is the difference between the
upstream and the downstream wind powers [3], i.e.
1

𝑃𝑤 = 𝜌𝐴𝑉𝑤 (𝑉𝑢 2 − 𝑉𝑑 2 )
2

(9)

Where 𝑉𝑢 is the upstream wind velocity at the
entrance of the rotor blades in m/s and 𝑉𝑑 is the
downstream wind velocity at the exit of the rotor
blades in m/s.
From the mass flow rate, the equation can be
written as

𝜌𝐴(𝑉𝑢 +𝑉𝑑 )
2

(10)

𝑉𝑤 being the average of the velocities at the entry
and exit of rotor blades of turbine. With this
expression, equation (10) can be simplified and
becomes
1

𝑃𝑤 = 𝜌𝐴𝑉𝑤 3
2

(11)

Where 𝐶𝑝 is a fraction called the power coefficient.
The power coefficient represents a fraction of the
power in the wind captured by the turbine and has a
theoretical maximum of 0.593. 𝐶𝑝 is often called the
Betz limit after the Germany physicist Albert Betz who
worked it out in 1919. The power coefficient can be
expressed by a typical empirical formula as
1

𝐶𝑝 = (𝜆 − 0.022𝛽2 − 5.6)𝑒 −0.17𝜆
2

(12)

Where β is the pitch angle of the blade in degrees
and λ is the tip speed ratio of the turbine, defined as
𝜆=

𝑉𝑤 (𝑚𝑝ℎ)
𝑤𝑏 (𝑟𝑎𝑑𝑠 −1 )

(13)

Where 𝑊𝑏 is the turbine angular speed. Equations
(5) - (13) describe the power captured by the turbine
and constitute the turbine model.
Energy storage system
The harnessing of renewable energies presents,
however, a further set of technical and economic
problems. Unlike fossil and nuclear fuels, which are
concentrated sources of energy that can be easily
stored and transported, renewable forms of energy
are highly dilute and diffuse. Moreover, their supply
can be extremely intermittent and unreliable. So,
batteries are required to even out irregularities in the
solar and wind power distributions. The development
of battery behavior models has been the focus of
researchers for many years. Based on the model
given by Gu H et al [5] and incorporation of the
diffusion precipitation mechanism studied by Ekdunge
and Simonsson [6] in the reaction kinetics of the
negative electrode, Kim and Hong [7] analyzed the
discharge performance of a flooded lead acid battery
cell using mathematical modeling. Bernardi and
Carpenter [8] developed a mathematical model of lead
acid batteries by adding the oxygen recombination
reaction. Nguyen et al. [9] presented a model
analogous to the flooded type and examined the
dynamic behavior of the cell during discharge with
respect to cold cranking amperage and reserve
capacity. In general, these models are complex in
terms of the expressions and number of parameters
employed. Yang et al. [10] states that a lead acid
battery is characterized by two indexes, i.e. the state
of charge (SOC) and the floating charge voltage (or
the terminal voltage). Extensive SOC determination
methods have been introduced by Sabine Piller et al.
[11]. It concluded that the most used modeling
technique at this time for all systems is ampere-hour
counting method because it is the most direct and
transparent method and quite easily implemented with

satisfyingly accurate results for short- time
applications, especially if used in the range of low to
medium SOC. The lead-acid battery is proposed in
this paper for energy storage. The section below
describes the mathematical formulation of lead acid
battery model based on its state of charge.
At any hour the state of battery is related to the
previous state of charge and to the energy production
and consumption situation of the system during the
time from t-1 to t. During the charging process, when
the total output of PV and wind generators is greater
than the load demand, the available battery bank
capacity at hour t can be described by [12].
𝐶𝑏𝑎𝑡 (𝑡) = 𝐶𝑏𝑎𝑡 (𝑡 − 1) ∗ (1 − 𝜎) + (𝐸𝑝𝑣 (𝑡) +
𝐸𝑊𝐺 (𝑡) −

𝐸𝐿(𝑡)
𝜂𝑖𝑛𝑣

) 𝜂𝑏𝑎𝑡

(14)

On the other hand, when the load demand is
greater than the available energy generated, the
battery bank is in discharging state. Therefore, the
available battery bank capacity at hour t can be
expressed as
𝐶𝑏𝑎𝑡 (𝑡) = 𝐶𝑏𝑎𝑡 (𝑡 − 1) ∗ (1 − 𝜎) − (

𝐸𝐿(𝑡)
𝜂𝑖𝑛𝑣

𝐸𝑊𝐺 (𝑡))

− 𝐸𝑝𝑣 (𝑡) +

Where Cbat(t) and Cbat(t-1) are the available battery
bank capacity (Wh) at hour t and t-1, respectively,
ηbat is the battery efficiency (During discharging
process, the battery efficiency = 1) σ is self-discharge
rate of the battery bank. Epv(t) and EWG(t) are the
energy generated by PV and wind generators,
respectively; EL(t) is the load demand at hour t and ηinv
is the inverter efficiency [%]
At any hour, the storage capacity is subject to the

ANN Based PV MPPT
A typical solar panel can converts only 30 to 40
percent of the incident solar irradiation into electrical
energy. Maximum power point tracking technique is
used to improve the efficiency of the solar panel.
Therefore the MPPT of a photovoltaic array is an
essential part of a PV system. As such, many
maximum power point tracking (MPPT) techniques
have been developed and implemented. Among these
techniques, hill-climbing MPPT such as perturb and
observe (P&O), which is a simple algorithm that does
not require previous knowledge of the PV generator
characteristics and is easy to implement with
analogue and digital circuits. In this technique, first the
PV voltage and current are measured and hence the
corresponding power is calculated. Considering a
small perturbation of voltage or perturbation of duty
cycle of the dc/dc converter in one direction

corresponding power is calculated. Is then compared
with. If is more than, then the perturbation is in the
correct direction; otherwise it should be reversed. In
this way, the peak power point is recognized and
hence the corresponding voltage can be calculated
[13] [14]. The major drawbacks of P&O/hill-climbing
are occasional deviation from the maximum operating
point in case of rapidly changing atmospheric
conditions, such as broken clouds. Also, correct
perturbation size is important in providing good
performance in both dynamic and steady-state
response [15]. In addition, P&O technique may cause
many oscillations around the MPP, and this slows
down the response of the system.
Introduction of intelligent MPPTs in PV systems is
very promising. They achieved very good
performances, fast responses with no overshoot, and
less fluctuations in the steady state for rapid
temperature and irradiance variations [19]. FL-based
MPPT do not require the knowledge of the exact PV
model [16] [17]. Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-Based
MPPT Technique operates like a black box model,
requiring no detail information about the PV system
[17]. For MPPT, ANN input can be PV array
parameters like PV voltages and currents,
environmental data like irradiance and temperature, or
any combination of these, whereas the output signal is
the identified maximum power or the duty cycle signal
used to drive the electronic converter to operate at the
MPP. The ANN input and output data are obtained
from experimental measurement or model-based
simulation results. After learning relation of with
temperature and irradiance, ANN can track the MPP
online [17].
In this paper, intelligent control technique using
ANN is associated to an MPPT controller in order to
increase the tracking response and consequently
increase the tracking efficiency of the solar panel. The
neural network control (NNC) has two inputs the solar
irradiance and temperature. NNC is used to estimate
the PV panel operating voltage (Vref) which
corresponds to the maximum power (Pmax) at any
given solar radiation and cell temperature. The
network was trained to recognize the relationships
between the input and output parameters. The
developed PV model is used to collect the training
data. The operating temperature is varied from 15 C
to 65 C in a step of 5C and the solar irradiance level is
varied from 100 W/m2 to 1000 W/m2 in a step of 50
W/m2, to get the training data sets for ANFIS. For
each pair of operating temperature and irradiance
level the reference voltage which corresponding to the
maximum available power is recorded. Table1 shows
a sample of training data set for ANFIS. Proposed
ANN based MPPT of the PV system is shown in fig 3.
The fig 4 shows the training errors versus epochs of
the ANFIS, The ANFIS MPPT structure is shown in fig
5. Fig 6 and 7 shows the input membership function of
the controller and Fig 8 and 9 shows rule view and

FLC Based Power Management
The Fuzzy Logic Controller is used to control the
power generated by wind source, PV source, Battery
and dump load. Depending on the load demand and
available power, the controller selects individual
source or combination of sources that will meet the
load demand. It will also control the battery state of
charge (SOC) by activating the charger control switch
when there is excess power from primary sources and
activates the discharging switch in case of primary
sources do not meet the load demand. The controller
has four inputs named as Load Power (Pl), Wind
turbine power (Pw), Solar PV Power (Ppv) and Battery
Power (Pb). The outputs for controller are Wind power
switch (SW1), PV power switch (SW2), Battery power
switch (SW3), Charger controller switch (SW4), dump
load charging switch (SW5) and dump load
discharging switch (SW6). All four inputs has three(3)
triangular membership function such as Low, Medium
and High L,M,H and all output have two membership
function (ON and OFF).
The FLC relates the outputs to the inputs using a
list of if-then statements called rules. The if-part of the
rules describes the fuzzy sets (regions) of the input
variables. In this paper, the fuzzy variables Pw, Pl, Pw
and Pb are described by fuzzy singleton, i.e. the
measured values of these variables are used in the
interface process without being fuzzified. Specifically,
the fuzzy rules are in the form:
Rule i: IF Pl is Ai and Ppv is Bi and Pw is Ci and
Pb is Di, THEN sw1 is Ei and SW2 is Fi and SW3 is
Gi and SW4 is Hi and SW5 Ii and SW6 is Ji.
Where Ai, Bi, Ci and Di are fuzzy subsets in their
universes of discourse, and Ei, Fi, Gi, Hi, Ii and Ji are
fuzzy singletons. Each universe of discourse is
divided into three fuzzy subsets: L (Low), M (Medium),
and H (High) and all outputs have two membership
function ON and OFF. For the inputs low is defined
from 0-200W, medium range from 200-600W and high
considered to range from 600-1000w. All selector
switches will be ON when any of the sources is low.
The battery state of charge is limited from 20% to 80%
which means the battery charging switch will be ON
only when the state is below 80% and the discharging
switch will be ON only when the SOC is above 20%.
This paper proposes Sugeno type of fuzzy inference
system.

Conclusion
The photovoltaic and wind hybrid power system is
simulated using MATLAB/Simulink software. ANN and
FLC MPPT Control is applied for solar and wind
sources to make the system efficient. The
performance of the MPPT was compared with the
classical P& O technique. Results indicate that the
ANN-based model developed in this work can predict
the MPP for a PV panel with high accuracy. Moreover
the simulation results of the developed Fuzzy logic
based Power Management shows that the controller
provides uninterrupted power, effective utilization of
sources, minimizing usage of battery and hence
improve battery life. It was found that the hybrid
topology exhibits excellent performance under various
operating conditions, and maintain the battery SOC
between 20 – 80%. It can be concluded that the
controller can satisfactory manage energy supply in a
PV-Wind hybrid power system.
