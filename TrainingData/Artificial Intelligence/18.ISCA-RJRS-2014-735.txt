Abstract
Several civil engineering activities need dynamic time history analysis or other numerical simulations. In such cases, it is
very important to have accurate and adequate accelerograms. However in most situations, there is not enough data for a
specific site or region. Many powerful methods are developed in order to generate artificial earthquake records. This paper
is aimed at combining non-stationary Kanai-Tajimi model and artificial neural networks for generation artificial earthquake
records. More precisely, two radial basis neural networks (RBF) are applied to conjecture filter parameters from response
spectrum. Moreover, in non-stationary Kanai-Tajimi method one needs to guess proper pattern for filter parameters, based
on human intelligence or experience. These patterns vary from one accelerogram to other because of record characteristics.
General regression neural network (GRNN) are used in order to find better approximation of filter parameters without use of
human judgment, applied to original non-stationary Kanai-Tajimi method. A new method in selecting proper Moving-TimeWindow size, used in non-stationary Kanai-Tajimi method is presented in this paper. Finally, RBFs are trained and used in
artificial accelerogram generation for a given velocity response spectrum. Three earthquake records, including Bam 2003,
Gheshm 2005 and Zanjiran 1994, occurred in Iran are used to verify proposed method. At the end, the performance of
proposed method is investigated statistically. Statistical results indicate the accuracy of the proposed method.
Keywords: Artificial accelerogram, non-stationary Kanai-tajimi model, radial basis neural network, general regression neural
network, gaussian white noise, moving-time-window.

Introduction
A safe and economic design of heavy industrial structures like
dams, cooling towers, nuclear power plants and high-rise
buildings requires special considerations. It is suitable to use
spectrum analysis method in some of above mentioned
structures. On the other hand, structural engineers have to
simulate dynamical systems, using time history analysis under
specific circumstances. Spectrum analysis method is used to
compute responses, required for designing. However, spectrum
analysis is unable to provide time information about structural
responses and behavior during time. Dynamic time history
analysis requires accurate and adequate accelerograms. Each
accelerogram must consider geological conditions of the region
and have the closest spectrum to actual spectrum. Due to the
lack of real seismic accelerograms and increasing use of
dynamic time history analysis, generating artificial earthquake
records plays an important role.
Because of random nature of earthquakes, many researchers
have studied stochastic models and it was extensively used in
earthquake simulation1-2. The stationary filtered white noise
model of earthquake by Kanai and Tajimi has attracted
considerable attention3-4. Ahmadi and Fan proposed a method,
based on non-stationary variables and frequency content5.
Rofooei et al applied this model with some changes and

generated artificial accelerograms6. Nonetheless, Ghodrati,
Bagheri and Fadavi and Ghodrati and Bagheri developed
innovative methods based on non-stationary Kanai-Tajimi
model and wavelet analysis7-8.
Artificial neural networks have a wide range of usage in various
research disciplines. Depending on type a neural network, it can
be used for pattern recognition, classification or function
approximation. Ghaboussi and Lin and Lin and Ghaboussi have
valuable researches regarding artificial neural networks9-10.
Their main idea is: if the response spectrum computation is
considered as a direct problem, determining an accelerogram
regarding the response spectrum will be the reverse problem
which can be solved using artificial neural network. Many
another researches are done by Li and Han, Bargi, Rahami and
Loux and Ghodrati and Bagheri, Ghodrati, Bagheri and Seyed
Razaghi11-14.
The purpose of this paper is to present an innovative method in
order to create several artificial accelerograms, having
appropriate consistency with the target spectrum. In this study, a
combined method, based on non-stationary Kanai-Tajimi model
and artificial neural networks is presented. This method tries to
minimize the effect of human intelligence and engineering
judgments, used in non-stationary Kanai-Tajimi model,
increasing performance and reducing errors in generating

artificial earthquake records. Because of learning capabilities of
a radial basis function neural network (RBF), this type of neural
network is used to estimate the knowledge of the inverse
mapping from response spectrum to earthquake accelerogram.
More precisely, two artificial neural networks are applied to
conjecture the filter parameters from response spectrum.
Rofooei et al6 used Moving-Time-Window technique in nonstationary Kanai-Tajimi model. This technique is applied in the
present paper. Moreover, a new method suggested for selecting
window size automatically. As well as, General regression
neural network (GRNN) are used instead of regression analysis
in non-stationary Kanai-Tajimi model. In the next section, the
original non-stationary Kanai-Tajimi model is presented.

The non-stationary Kanai-Tajimi model
The generalized Kanai-Tajimi model is based on Kanai's
investigation on the frequency content of various earthquake
records3. Tajimi proposed equation (1) for the spectral density
function of strong ground motion with a distinct dominant
frequency4.

G ω =

1+4ξ2g ω ωg
1− ω ωg

(1)

In which ξg and ωg are the ground damping ratio and frequency
respectively and G0 is the constant power spectral intensity of
the bed rock excitation. In practice these parameters should be
estimated from local earthquake records or geological features.
Kanai-Tajimi power spectral density function, corresponding
with damping ratio is presented in figure-1.

This model assumes that earthquakes are stationary phenomena,
which is not correct. A stationary process in mathematics is a
process that does not change its character with respect to time 15,
while, earthquake records have intense non-stationary
characteristic. Ahmadi and Fan5 suggested a model, governed
by equations (2) and (3), capturing the non-stationary nature of
earthquake in order to overcome the drawbacks of Kanai-Tajimi
model.
X f + 2ξg t ωg t X f + ω2g t Xf = n t
X g = − 2ξg t ωg t Xf +

ω2g

(2)

t Xf e t

(3)

Where Xf is filtered response, 𝜔𝑔 t is time dependent ground
frequency, 𝜉𝑔 t is effective ground damping coefficient, Xg is
output ground acceleration, e t is the amplitude envelope
function and n(t) is a stationary Gaussian white noise process.5
Rofooei et al (2001) generated a new method according to this
model to generate artificial earthquake records. In this method,
ωg t and e t are estimated, using Moving-Time-Window
procedure. This method is summarized as following 6:
i. Time duration of strong ground motion is determined. ii.
Optimum size of Moving-Time-Window is computed. iii. So as
to estimate e t , Moving-Time-Window is used as a time
interval and moved from the beginning to the end of the
accelerogram. The standard deviation of each Moving-TimeWindow is calculated, using equation (4) and assigned to the
center point of current Moving-Time-Window.
σ=

E X2 − E X

(4)

Where, X is the value of accelerogram points residing in
Moving-Time-Window. A smooth algebraic time function 𝜎𝑎 𝑡
is fitted to the time variation of the standard deviation. This
function varies from one accelerogram to another and needs to
be selected using human intelligence or experience. The
amplitude envelope function, defined in equation-5 is
calculated.
e t = C0 . σa t

(5)

Where, C0 is a constant that will be determined by normalizing
the mean intensity of the synthetic accelerograms to the
intensity of actual accelerogram. In order to compute ωg t ,
Moving-Time-Window procedure is used again. As the first
step, the zero-crossing rate of accelerogram is calculated for
each Moving-Time-Window, using equation-6 and assigned to
the center point.

Where 𝑡𝑤 is the size of window. Again, a suitable algebraic
time-dependent function is fitted to the variation of the zerocrossing rate Fca t . Selecting the pattern of this function is
important and needs human intelligence. The ground frequency

faster than perceptron networks and they create a better
decision-making circumstance17.
(7)

Now, it is possible to generate artificial accelerograms. At first,
a Gaussian white noise is generated and after that, equations-2
and 3 are solved for Xg .
It is very important to select suitable time-window size. It
should be sufficiently short to capture the rapid changes in
frequency content and sufficiently long to provide stable
estimation of parameters and to capture significant low
frequency components. Attention was also given to the stability
of the parameter estimations for each record. In mentioned
study, the optimal time-window size is selected based on the
frequency content of the earthquake using a trial and error
method6.

In recent years, a wide range of researches for solving problems
based on pragmatic data in which there is either no solution or a
hard-to-deal-with one. One of the solutions is using the artificial
neural networks which transfer the rule or the knowledge
beyond the data to the network structure, processing the
practical data. Hence these systems are called intelligent
systems, because they learn the general rule through calculating
numeric data and instances. These systems try for modeling the
human's brain neuro-synaptic structure. There are diverse kinds
of networks. They all are formed by neurons and connections
between them. In fact each node is a calculative unit of the
network which obtains inputs, processes them and finally
provides the outputs. The performed process by neuron can
include the simplest one such as collecting inputs to the most
complex calculations. On the other hand, connections define the
quality of data transfer among neurons. In General form,
connections can be either unilateral or bilateral. The researches
have shown that only one neuron with many inputs is not
enough for solving the problems. In this case, one needs several
neurons to function in a parallel way. One or more neurons
juxtaposed to each other form a layer of the network. A network
can contain one or more layers. The meaning of training in
neural networks is computing all weights of all connections
between neurons16.

The artificial Neural Networks

In 1985, Powel achieved a method based on radial function for
multi-variant internal-exploration. In 1988, Broomhead and
Lowe employed this approach in neural networks and according
to that the neural networks based on radial based function which
are herein mentioned as RBF were created. RBF is a three-layer
feed-forward neural network which able to process each nonlinear mapping with the aid of changing parameters by using the
non-linear transform functions in the neurons. RBF architecture
accelerates the training speed by lining making in determining
the weight of connections. The RBF networks have recently
been used for practical issues like pattern recognition, signal
processing, etc. RBF networks have several advantages rather
than multi-layer perceptron networks. They usually train much

ym

The first layer is the input one. There is no processing in the
input layer. The second layer or the hidden layer creates a nonlinear conformity between the input space and a larger area in
which the patterns turn to the linear separable ones. Finally the
third layer produces the weight sum along with the linear
outputs. For function approximation, above mentioned RBF
network seems to be effective. However, in pattern recognition
problems, sigmoid function should be used as transform
function for output layer neurons in order to produce 0 or 1
values17.
A unique feature of RBF is process that is done in hidden layer.
Thus the radial basis function is used as transform function for
hidden layer neurons. The most usual radial function form is
defined as:
𝜙(r) = e

Equation-8 indicates a normal Bell-shaped curve as shown in
figure-3. Where, r is the numeric amount of the distance length
from the cluster center. The variant is defined as width or the
radial of the Bell-shaped and in compulsorily cases it is
sometimes assessed empirically.

The estimated distance to the cluster center is usually of
Euclidean type. When a neuron receives an input pattern, the
mentioned distance can be calculated through equation-9.

rj =

𝑥𝑖 − 𝑤𝑖𝑗

(9)

Where 𝑥𝑖 is input and 𝑤𝑖𝑗 is weight between neuron 𝑖 and 𝑗.
Thus the jth neuron output in the hidden layer is as follow:
𝜙𝑗 =

𝑛
𝑥 𝑖 −𝑤 𝑖𝑗
− 𝑖=1

(10)

Training neural networks with radial function is a kind of
supervised training, which needs a set of so called “training
data”, including a complete set of inputs and corresponding
outputs. Hidden layer of a RBF network has some weighted
units which are corresponding to the vector pointing out the
cluster center. The weights of hidden layer can be calculated
through traditional methods like "K-Mean" algorithm. After
training the hidden layer through the training algorithms, the last
stage of training the output layer will be fulfilled through using
a standard technique of gradient descent17.
General Regression Neural Network (GRNN): This type of
artificial neural network has been developed for identifying and
modeling practical problems by Specht18. The structure of this
network is very similar to RBF. The main characteristic of
GRNN is the ability to estimate any function by having a set of
input and output data, used as training set17. Suppose a function
with 𝑛 inputs of the form 𝑥 = (𝑥1 , 𝑥2 , … , 𝑥𝑛 ) and one output of
the form 𝑦. The expected average of an output can be calculated
by having a single input of 𝑥 through equation-12.
𝑦 𝑥 =

∞
−∞ 𝑦×𝑃𝐷𝐹 𝑥 ,𝑦 𝑑𝑦

𝑃𝐷𝐹 𝑥

(12)

This equation includes the function 𝑃𝐷𝐹(𝑥 , 𝑦) which is the joint
probability density function 𝑥 and 𝑦 and it computes the
probability when output is equal to 𝑦 and input is equal to 𝑥 .
The probability density functions are estimated through the sum
of Gaussian functions. Therefore the conditional probability
functions can be estimated by placing a Gaussian function
center on each existed inputs in a training set and multiplying
these Gaussian functions by each output corresponding to
inputs. Finally, it can be calculated through equation-13.

(13)

In this equation it is supposed that 𝑝 couples of data are
available in the training set. Each couple includes a training
pair, containing an input vector 𝑥𝑝 = (𝑥1𝑝 , 𝑥2𝑝 , … , 𝑥𝑛𝑝 ) and the
output 𝑦𝑝 corresponding to the input vector 𝑥𝑝 . 𝑑𝑝 indicates the

Euclidean distance between the new input vector and 𝑝𝑡𝑕 input
vector in training set. In order to compute output of a new input
vector, the distance of this vector and all other existed input
vectors in the training set will be calculated, afterward the
amount of each Gaussian distribution based on its distance to
new input will be estimated and multiplying by each output
corresponding to input vectors. The denominator of equation
(13) indicates the summation of outputs of the Gaussian
functions17.
The proposed Model: As mentioned before, this research
present a creative technique with admixture non-stationary
Kanai-Tajimi model and artificial neural networks for
generating artificial earthquake records which has good
performance and minimum effect of human intelligence or
judgment. In order to reduce human intelligence, two artificial
neural networks, called ANN-I and ANN-II have been trained to
receive the velocity response spectrum as the input and render
the smooth time functions of zero-crossing rate and standard
deviation as the output. In other word, Fca t and 𝜎𝑎 𝑡 will be
obtained using artificial neural networks. This means that there
is no need of judgment or experience for selecting a good
pattern for all smoothed functions. In fact, they are obtained
automatically. In the next step, one Gaussian white noise is
made for obtaining each artificial accelerogram. Then,
equations-2 and 3 will be solved for Xg . A schematic algorithm
of proposed method is presented in figure-4.
Suggested method has two general stages: Architecture
designing and training the neural networks, Modeling and
producing the artificial accelerograms.
In this research, two radial basis function neural network (RBF)
have been used. In order to train neural network, we need pairs
of data, input and its corresponding output. The inputs of the
networks are the velocity response spectrum which can be
calculated through the typical methods. The outputs of ANN-I
and ANN-II are smooth time functions of zero-crossing rate and
the standard deviation, respectively. Outputs are computed
using the ''Moving Time Window'' technique. Thus, a window
size is selected for each training accelerogram and the timedependent parameters such as zero-crossing rate and standard
deviation are calculated, using equation-4 and 6, within each
window and allocated to the central point. Finally, a smooth
algebraic time function is fitted to the time variations.
As noted before, the important point in using the Moving-TimeWindow technique is to choose the appropriate size of the
window; this size should be small enough to be able not only to
capture the rapid changes of the frequency content but also to
compute stable approximation of parameters in time interval.
Meanwhile it should be large enough to be able to capture the
lower frequency content. Because of using different
accelerograms for training the neural networks, the size of each
Moving-Time-Window should be calculated properly and
automatically. In this research a novel method is used for

selecting the size of Moving-Time-Window. In this method, the
Fast Fourier transform of each accelerogram is investigated. To
achieve a logical balance between the upper and lower
frequencies, a proportion of the energy from the whole
accelerogram is chosen. This proportion can be changed to
achieve the best responses. Then the frequency 𝑓𝑛 in which the
accelerogram reaches to this specific level of its whole energy

will be determined from Fast Fourier spectrum. The
corresponding period will be used as the size of the window. In
figure-5 different samples of window size selection is presented.
The outcomes of this research indicate that using the standard of
forty percent of the whole energy is a good selection in order to
achieve better results.

After selecting window size and computing the time-dependent
parameters of filter, a smooth algebraic time function is fitted to
these time variations. As mentioned before, these functions vary
between diverse accelerograms. For training ANN-I and ANNII, because of using different accelerograms two GRNN are
applied instead of regression analysis. In the recent years it has
been shown that the multilayer perceptron networks with a
hidden layer, containing sigmoid transform functions in the
middle layer and linear transform functions in the output layer
are able to estimate any give function with a specific error
tolerance16. In the other hand, amongst radial basis function
neural networks, GRNN networks are used in order to
approximate functions. GRNN is able to estimate any function
by having a set of input and output data. In present study, two
GRNN, called GRNN-I and GRNN-II are applied. The input of
GRNNs is the time. The outputs of GRNN-I and GRNN-II are
smooth time functions of zero-crossing rate and the standard
deviation, respectively. In order to train GRNN-I a set of time
and time variation of zero-crossing rate, as input and output data
are given to this network. Similarly, GRNN-II receives a set of
time and time variation of standard deviation for training. Now,

International Science Congress Association

GRNN-I and GRNN-II are able to provide a proper and smooth
approximation for zero-crossing rate and standard deviation. In
figure-6 different samples of smooth function approximation by
GRNNs is presented.
Velocity response spectrum and two smooth time functions,
zero-crossing rate and standard deviation, are prepared for each
accelerogram in training set. In the next step two RBF networks
are trained for these data. Afterwards, ANN-I and ANN-II are
able to provide a proper and smooth approximation for standard
deviation and zero-crossing rate as outputs, in return for
receiving velocity response spectrum as input.
After network training, to produce artificial earthquake records,
a spectrum corresponded to each test accelerogram is calculated
and is presented to ANNs as input. ANN-I is presented zerocrossing rate smooth time function and ANN-II standard
deviation smooth function in output. Then amplitude envelope
function e t and ground frequency function ωg t are
calculated using relations (5) and (7), respectively.

For computing the envelope function C0 is considered . Then, a
time series Gaussian white noise 𝑛(𝑡), must be created. Next,
the differential equation-2 is solved. For solving this equation
the numerical Runge-Kutta method is used which is able to
compute and illustrate error, simultaneously. By solving that
and determining the filtered responses and also placement in
equation-3, the artificial ground accelerations are generated.

Numerical simulations
In order to investigate the performance of the improved and
mechanized method, three earthquake records are used
separately and numerous artificial accelerograms are generated
from each actual record. The preliminary characteristics of
records are presented in table-1.
All used accelerograms have been recorded in 0.005s time
intervals, which is very time consuming in order to be analyzed
and simulated. Therefore a method has been used for decreasing
the number of pairs in each accelerogram. Considering Shannon
sampling theorem which has represented if a signal has finite
energy, the minimum sampling rate is equal to two samples per
period of the highest frequency component of the signal. 15 So,
when the sampling period of a signal is 0.02, the sampled signal
will have the capacity of the correct display up to the frequency
of 25 𝑕𝑒𝑟𝑡𝑧. Regarding the natural frequency specifications of

the earthquakes, this assumption is sufficient in order to
represent earthquake signal in 0.02s intervals.
In other hand, a new earthquake record is obtained from actual
one, using 211 = 2048 points. There are two possible
conditions; in the first case, the number of all remaining points
is less than 2048. In this circumstance, enough number of zero
acceleration points are added to the record. In the second case,
the number of all remaining points is greater than 2048. In such
situations, the number of data in record is reduced, using
Trifunac and Brady algorithms20. This algorithm considers only
ninety five percent of whole energy of earthquake as strong
duration. Finally, These records were scaled with their peak
ground acceleration to 1𝑔.
In training step, networks input are velocity response spectrum
in the period interval of 0.01 𝑠𝑒𝑐 to 4.6 𝑠𝑒𝑐 in 460 points,
which is computed by applying Newmark method with average

The performance of proposed method is investigated
statistically. For this purpose, fifty artificial accelerograms are
generated and comparison has been made between actual
response spectrum and the average of synthetic accelerograms
spectral values. To calculate the spectrum, Newmark method is
used and damping coefficient of the single degree of freedom
structure is assumed to be equal to five percent. Actual record of
each earthquake is presented in figures-7 through 9. In each
case, one artificial accelerogram is presented and statistical
results of fifty artificial records are computed and compared
with actual one. Numerical simulations show that the proposed
method has an acceptable accuracy, regarding actual results.
More statistical analysis is done, using fifty artificial
accelerogram for each actual record. The mean value and
standard deviation of velocity response spectrum are computed
through equations-14 and 15:

Moreover, present study tries to reduce human intelligence and
experience needed in selecting proper patterns for smooth
function approximation of standard deviation and zero-crossing
rate diagrams. More study is performed to adopt the MovingTime-Window technique, used in the original method with
proposed method in order to reduce human judgment in
selecting the size of Moving-Time-Window. Therefore, the
proposed method is automatic and is able to be used as
standalone software. Statistical results show the accuracy of the
proposed method. Maximum amount of error occurs for stiff
structures with a period less than 0.05s, which is not common in
ordinary buildings, so this automated method can be applied for
ordinary buildings safely.
The findings in this study are in accordance with Khodaie
Mahmoodi et al23, Sheeba and Rangarajan24, Ali Shah etal25,
Samadi et al26 and Nadeem Saher27.
