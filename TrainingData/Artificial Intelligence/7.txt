Abstract
In this paper, we introduced a robust approach to induction motor control combining fuzzy
logic and variable structure with a sliding mode control. Fuzzy tuning schemes are employed
to improve control performance as well as to reduce chattering in the sliding mode. This
combination ensures system high performance and fast dynamic response with no overshoot.
Becoming a very robust, insensitive to process parameters variation and external
disturbances.

1. Introduction
Induction motor (IM) is widely used in various industries as prime workhorses to produce
rotational motions and forces as it has many advantages, in terms of low cost, high
efficiency, good self starting, simplicity of design, the absence of the collector brooms system
and a small inertia. However, induction motor has disadvantages, such as complex, nonlinear
and multivariable of nature, in addition of being inherently unable of providing variable speed
operation. Generally, variable speed drives for induction motors require both wide operating
range of speed and fast torque response, regardless of load variations.
Field oriented control method is used for advanced control of induction motor drives. By
providing decoupling of torque and flux control demands, the vector control can govern an
induction motor drive similar to a separate excited direct current motor without sacrificing the
quality of the dynamic performance.
However, the field oriented control of induction motor drives presents two main problems
that have been providing quite a bit research interest in the last decade. The first one relies on
the uncertainties in the machine models and load torque, and the second one is the precise
computation of the motor speed without using speed sensors.
The decoupling characteristics of the vector control are sensitive to machine parameters
variations. Moreover, the machine parameters and load characteristics are not exactly known,
and may vary during motor operations. Thus, the dynamic characteristics of such systems are
very complex and nonlinear. Therefore, many studies have been made on the motor drives in
order to preserve the performance under these parameter variations and external load
disturbances, such as nonlinear control, optimal control, variable structure system control,
adaptive control and neural control [6-9] and [15].
Sliding mode control (SMC), based on the theory of variable structure systems (VSS), has
been applied to robust control of nonlinear systems [2]. Sliding mode control performs well in
trajectory tracking of some nonlinear systems. It employs a discontinuous control law to drive
the state trajectory toward specified sliding surface and maintain its motion along the sliding

surface in the state space. It is a common opinion that the major drawback of sliding mode
control is the so-called chattering phenomenon. Such a phenomenon consists of the
oscillation of the control signal, tied to the discontinuous nature of the control strategy, at a
frequency and with an amplitude capable of disrupting, damaging or, at least, wearing the
controlled physical system (e.g., in mechanical systems with backlash).
Several methods of chattering reduction have been reported. One approach [3-4] places a
boundary layer around the switching surface such that the relay control is replaced by a
saturation function. Another method [3, 5] replaces a max–min-type control by a unit vector
function. These approaches, however, provide no guarantee of convergence to the sliding
mode and involve a tradeoff between chattering and robustness.
Chattering Reduction be achieved without harming system robustness by combining the
attractive features of fuzzy control with SMC [11-13] and [18]. Fuzzy logic, first proposed by
Zadeh [14], has proven to be a potent tool for controlling ill-defined or parameter-variant
plants. By incorporating heuristics engineering rules, a fuzzy logic controller can cope well
with severe uncertainties, although a heavy computational burden may arise with some
implementations. Fuzzy schemes with explicit expressions for tuning can avoid this problem
[16].
This paper presents a robust control system using sliding mode control that incorporates a
fuzzy tuning technique. The proposed controller is applied to induction motor to control the
speed and flux. The control law superposes equivalent control and fuzzy control. An
equivalent control law is first designed then we introduce a fuzzy logic control (FLC) in this
later the sign function is replaced in order to limit the chattering phenomenon originated by
finite-frequency switching control and to preserve the main advantages of the original slidingmode approach (robustness, simplicity, and finite-time convergence).

The design procedure for a state based sliding mode controller can be divided into two
stages [1]:

S X

that divides the state

space into two disjoint parts: S  X  > 0 and S  X  < 0 .
Step 2: Designing a controller U, which insures that the sliding mode is reached and
subsequently maintained [1].

This can be expressed by:

This condition is called invariance condition of the sliding surface.

During the sliding mode and the permanent state, the surface is zero  S  X 
therefore, its derivative and the discontinuous part are also zero S  X   0 and
Hence, we deduce the expression of the equivalent control:

4.1. Synthesis of Sliding Mode Controllers SMC
The first step of sliding mode control design is to select a sliding surface that models the
desired closed-loop performance in state variable space. Then design the control such that the
system state trajectories are forced toward the sliding surface and stay on it. Now, suppose
that a sliding surface is given as:
S 1  e1    1  e1  e1
S 2  e 2    2  e 2  e 2

Our objective is to control rotor speed  and rotor magnitude flux given by:  r2

Here  rref and  ref are the desired flux and speed respectively.

5. Simulation and Discussion Results
The behaviour of the overall system is tested by simulation for three phase induction
machine represented in Figure 3.

Figure 3. Principe Scheme of the Proposed FLSMC of IM
A series of simulation tests were carried out on induction motor drive using both the
sliding mode controller SMC and fuzzy logic sliding mode controller (FLSMC), for various
operating conditions.
Figure 4 shows speed response with both the SMC and FLSMC controller. The FLSMC
controller performed with better performance as far as the rise time and steady state error are
concerned. The speed response is well damped within a rise time of 0.025s.

Figure 8. Simulation Results under Variations of the Moment of nertia
To be noted that, the variation of the moment of inertia has no significant influence on
performances of the FLSMC proposed control.

6. Conclusion
A new hybrid technique control system to indirect vector controlled induction motor
combining the features of SMC and fuzzy control has been presented in this paper. Fuzzy
tuning schemes are employed to reduce chattering and accelerate reaching the steady state
phase. The FLSMC has the advantage in handling the torque ripple phenomenon and
reducing the number of the fuzzy rules and these, themselves, were simplified. The drive
system has been simulated with fuzzy logic controller and SMC controller and their
performance have been compared. Here, simulation results shows that the designed FLSMC
controller realizes a better dynamic behavior of the motor with a rapid settling time, no
overshoot and has better performance than SMC controller. FLSMC control is more robust
with respect to parameter variations and external disturbances.
