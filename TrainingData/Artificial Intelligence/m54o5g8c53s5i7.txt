Abstract: This paper proposes a hybrid immune and simulated annealing algorithm (HISA) to solve equivalent current injection
based optimal power flow problem with both continuous and discrete control variables, which is known as discrete optimal power flow
(DOPF). Continuous and discrete variables are processed using different techniques; continuous variables (unit active power outputs and
generator-bus voltage magnitudes) are solved by current-based OPF, and discrete variable (transformer-tap settings and shunt capacitor
devices) using HISA. Computational results indicate that HISA incorporates unique features that include a novel diversity and affinity
calculation method, and a redefined crossover and mutation scheme. As a result, HISA performs better in terms of robustness and
efficiency in non-convex OPF problems.
Keywords: Equivalent current injection, discrete optimal power flow, immune algorithm, simulated annealing

1 Introduction
The optimal power flow (OPF) problem was first
mentioned by Carpentier [1] in 1962 as a network
constrained economic dispatch problem. The currentbased concept that was proposed to deal with the
unbalanced distribution system was extensively tested in
[2,3,4]; loads modeled by PQ buses and various
formulations could be formed according to network
parameters. The handling of non-convex OPF objective
functions, along with the unit prohibited operating zones
also present problems for mathematical programming of
optimal power flow.
In practical power system operation, the OPF problem
with both continuous and discrete control variables,
taking the valve-point loading effects of the thermal
generator into consideration, is a highly constrained,
large-dimensional, and non-convex optimization problem
[5,6,7]. [8] successfully implemented equivalent current
injection (ECI) based hybrid current-power optimal
power flow (ECIOPF) with predictor-corrector interior
point algorithm (PCIPA). Based on [8], continuous
variables could be solved for faster and more accurately.
OPF programs based on mathematical programming
have been designed for purely continuous-variable OPF.
However, OPF is a mixed-integer non-linear programm∗ Corresponding

ing (NLP) problem with discrete control variables, such
as switchable shunt devices, transformer tap positions,
and phase shifters. In the last few decades, several
stochastic optimization methods have been developed,
such as Genetic Algorithms (GA), Evolutionary Programming (EP), Evolution Strategies (ES), Immune Algorithms (IA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and
Simulated Annealing (SA) [9,10,11,12,13,14]. The
application of these algorithms in global optimization
problems is desirable because they provide better global
search capabilities compared to conventional optimization
algorithms. [9] presented a GA-based OPF algorithm for
security enhancement that identifies the optimal value of
generator active-power output and angle of the
phase-shifting transformers. [10] proposed an efficient
and reliable EP algorithm with discrete control variables
for solving the optimal power flow problem. [12]
addressed the short-term unit commitment problem by
applying an immune algorithm to power system
operation; the IA used an immune memory cell and
changed the crossover and mutation ratio from fixed
values to the fuzzy system. [13] described the application
of a PSO-based OPF method with the individual of
continuous control variables structure for solving the OPF
problem with the smooth fuel cost of generator.

C. H. Huang: A Hybrid Artificial Intelligence Algorithm for .....

In this paper, we propose a hybrid immune and
simulated annealing algorithm (HISA) for optimal power
flow intended for practical applications, which is based on
equivalent current-injection with continuous/discrete
control variables. This paper is organized as follows:
Section 2 formulates the ECIOPF model with PCIPA.
Discrete OPF (DOPF) with HISA is discussed in Section
3. Other stochastic search methods are summarized in
Section 4, and extensive numerical simulations using the
IEEE 30 bus demonstrate that the proposed method is
more robust and efficient in comparison. Conclusions are
presented in Section 5.

Comparing (4) with (1), the Jacobian has become statedependent. Jacobian elements with PQ buses do not need
to be updated and elements PV buses only need to update
some elements in each iteration.

2.2 PCIPA for ECIOPF
2 Current based OPF problem
The ECIOPF problem can be divided into two parts: 1)
the equivalent current injection model and 2) PCIPA for
ECIOPF.

In this paper, we formulate the OPF problem as a PCIPA
problem [15] where the objective is to minimize the
generator cost subject to various constraints. PCIPA is a
primal-dual path-following algorithm that solves
quadratic and linear formulations, and it is an extension
of interior-point. In this study, we discuss a general
optimization problem represented as

from (9), and the corresponding set of linear correction

represented by an integer matrix of dimension
PS*N (N = Nt + Nc ), where PS is the population size, and
Nt and Nc are the number of transformer-tap settings and
shunt capacitor devices, respectively. The antibodies are
generated randomly in the feasible space. For the purpose
of this study, each gene was between 0 and 20. The genes
were decoded as an antibody that was produced by (12).
Note that a population pool is composed of these
antibodies, and a group of genes forms an antibody.

The upper left block of (10) is an augmented Hessian
matrix. The elements of a Hessian matrix are the second
order partial derivatives of the augmented objective
function with respect to all variables. In this paper, PCIPA
is executed with a complete augmented gradient vector.
Since nonlinear terms are unknown, (10) can be solved by
following predictor and corrector steps [16].

3.2 Offspring
Offspring are formed by either the merging of two
antibodies from the current generation by a crossover
operator or modification of an antibody by a mutation
operator. This crossover operator was first proposed by
Yamamura, Ono, and Kobayashi [17]. This operator first
selects subtours from parents , where subtours contain the
common cities. Offspring are created by exchanging
subtours, as depicted in Figure 2.

3 Application of HISA in DOPF problem
The Hybrid Immune and Simulated Annealing Algorithm, which is described in this paper integrates the
Immune Algorithm and Simulated Annealing. In the
proposed method, objectives and constraints are first
represented as antigen input. This step is followed by
antibody production on a feasible space through genetic
operations. Genetic operators, such as crossover and
mutation through the Redefined Crossover and Mutation
Scheme (RCMS), are then processed to produce
antibodies in a feasible space. An affinity calculation is
also contained within the algorithm and it determines the
promotion/suppression of antibody productions. The
HISA procedure for the DOPF is described next.

3.1 Initialization and decoding
Antibody initialization with the structural gene chain
architecture is performed to generate solution candidates
for the DOPF problem. Each gene here indicates a

Fig. 2: Example of using the subtour exchange crossover
operator.

Mutation is a background operator that produces
random changes in various antibodies with a mutation
rate equal to Pm. The mutation operator is defined in (13).
The mutation operator of HISA is the same as SA, i.e. the
optimal parent is always used to form the next offspring.
If the offspring is infeasible, another parent will be
chosen until a feasible solution is obtained.

πioffspring : the i-th gene of the offspring
πioptimal : the i-th gene of the optimal parent
γ random variable between π max and π min
Redefined Crossover and Mutation Scheme (RCMS)
In the sample immune algorithm, crossover generally
executes before mutation. A higher crossover rate allows
the exploration of the solution space around the parent
solution. A high mutation rate explores new solution
territory. A lower rate may localize the solution at a local
optimum. The offspring lose their resemblance to the
parents and the algorithm does not learn from the past and
may become unstable. To overcome this, a modified
crossover and mutation scheme is proposed as follows:
(i) Generate offspring by introducing CP(g) with
(a) if rand < CP(g): using crossover
(b) if rand > CP(g): using mutation
where
rand: a uniform random number in (0, 1)
CP: the control parameter with initial value set to 0.5,
0 ≤ CP ≤ 1
g: the current generation number
In this case, offspring will be generated until all
parents have been processed. Since crossover and
mutation are both random operators, there is no way
of knowing which one is the better of the two. Figure
3 depicts the initial relationship between crossover
and mutation in RCMS. The sum of the probability of
crossover and mutation equals one.

there is higher likelihood for mutation to generate

as indicated in (15), and the variation of probability of

(i) The solutions just visited except the best solution in the
current generation,
(ii) The local optimum is ever visited,
(iii) The antibodies violate the constraints.

3.4 Fitness function evaluation
Each candidate solution is assigned a fitness score to
measure its optimality with respect to the objective being
optimized. The fitness score of each gene is found by
calculating the objective function of ECIOPF. If one or
more variables violate their limits, the corresponding
antibody will be put into the tabu list to avoid generating
the same infeasible solution again.

3.5 Diversity and affinity calculations
HISA produce diverse antibodies by recognizing the
affinities between antibodies or between antigens and

Appl. Math. Inf. Sci. 9, No. 1L, 197-204 (2015) / www.naturalspublishing.com/Journals.asp

antibodies. The quality of solutions in the feasible space
can be guaranteed better through the diversity embodiment. To calculate diversity, HISA uses the Euclidean
distance (ED) to substitute for information entropy theory
used in IA [19]. AdoptingSA into HISA, the diversity of
each antibody is calculated only between the 2 ∗ PS
antibodies (PS parents and PS offspring) and the best
antibody. Let the best antibody yi (0), i = 1, 2, 3, . . . , N,
and 2 ∗ PS competing antibodies Y (k) = [y1 (k), y2 (k),
. . . , yi (k), . . . , yN (k)], k = 1, 2, 3, . . . , 2 ∗ PS, be represented
as
Ybest = [y1 (0) y2 (0) · · · yi (0) · · · yN (0)]

(18)

The Euclidean distance between the best and
competing antibodies is calculated as

201

3.6 Ranking of selections
Antibodies will be ranked in ascending order according to
their total affinity scores by a sorting algorithm. The first
PS antibodies are selected and their (Aff)k is used for the
next generation. The current best solution (Point A in
Figure 6) may not reach the global optimum (Point G),
because it is too far. Generally, solutions with slightly
better cost (Point B) as calculated by (21) prevail, and so
this solution is premature. To prevent premature
termination of the algorithm, point G, which has slightly
worse cost than B, needs a higher rand value to be
selected. That is, a lower (Affb) k is obtained for a longer
ED (k). Therefore, the new offspring selected in (20)
could prevent premature termination of the algorithm and
converge to a global optimal solution.

where (Aff b is the affinity between the best antibody and

Therefore, this affinity value lies between zero and one.
The other affinity in HISA is the affinity between the
antigen and the antibody, where the combination intensity
between the objective and the solution is evaluated as
follows:
(21)
(Affg )k = Ob j fk
where the Obj f k is the value of the objective function with
relation to the k-th antibody. The total affinity is calculated
from the two affinities as:

4.2 Optimal solution with HISA

The proposed HISA algorithm was tested on a standard
IEEE 30-bus test system [20]. The system has 25 control
variables, which are as follows: six unit active power
outputs, six generator-bus voltage magnitudes, four
transformer-tap settings, and nine var-injection values of
the shunt capacitor. Three different cases were considered
in this study. First, the proposed current-based OPF was
applied to obtain the optimal-control variables, which are
continuous variables under normal conditions. In the
second case, the HISA algorithm was applied to solve the
discrete OPF with continuous and discrete variables. In
the third case, the proposed HISA algorithm is compared
with other AI algorithms, including IA, GA, EP, SA, and
ES.

The system has 25 control variables, which are as
follows: six unit active power outputs, six generator-bus
voltage magnitudes, four transformer-tap settings, and
nine var-injection values of shunt capacitor. The unit
power output and generator-bus voltage are continuous
control variables. The discrete variables are transformertap settings and shunt capacitor devices. The adjustable
range of the transformer-tap setting is 0.95 p.u. to 1.05
p.u., the step size is 0.005 p.u. The lower and upper limits
of the shunt capacitor devices are set from 0.0 to 10 Mvar,
respectively, and the step size is 0.5 Mvar. As the optimal
solution of the AI problem is different for each run, fifty
runs were performed and are examined in Section 4.2 and
4.3.
The optimal solution and the value of discrete
variables are shown in Table 2. The operating costs of the
best and worst solutions are 772.28 $/h and 773.94 $/h
(0.21% difference), respectively and the average solution
cost is 772.95 $/h. To show the convergence of HISA,
average statistics of the antibody over fifty trials are
plotted in Figure 9. The average number of iterations
taken to converge and CPU time are 62 times and 1042 s,
respectively.

4.1 Optimal solution without discrete variables
In this system, the continuous control variables are the
unit active power outputs and generator-bus voltage
magnitudes whose limits are listed in [10]. The load
demand is 189.2 MW and the objective function is 775.39
$/h. Convergence tolerance is 10−8 for the barrier
parameter µ , the CPU time is 0.86 seconds, and OPF
converges after 9 iterations. The optimal solution with
only continuous variables is shown in Table 1, and the
values of the objective function for each iteration are
shown in Figure 8.

experimental results are shown in Table 3 including CPU
time, unit cost and number of iterations. In addition, the
average, maximum, minimum, parameter setting, and the
number of iterations taken to reach global and sub-global
optimum are also listed. Table 3 shows that every method
reaches the optimal solution. However, HISA performs
better in terms of the number of generations it takes to
converge, the quality of the solution and performance.
Figure 10 depicts the convergence of the average over
50 trials. The HISA method has a steep convergence rate
towards an acceptable solution for all cases, thereby
demonstrating that the HISA method has a better
convergence property than other algorithms tested here.

An efficient HISA-based method for solving discrete
optimal power flow problems is presented in this study. A
novel approach is used to optimize the generator unit cost
by using IA and SA algorithms, and for expanding the
original IA and SA to the HISA algorithm. The proposed
approach searches the local and global neighborhoods to
search for optimal cost reduction by adjusting the
transformer-tap setting and shunt capacitor. The proposed
method performs better than other methods in terms of
solution quality, convergence rate and computation
efficiency.
The proposed HISA algorithm offers better performance due to the following features:
(1) It integrates the advantages of IA and SA and utilizes a
novel estimation of diversity and affinity derived from
IA,
(2) It integrates automatic regulation of the frequency of
crossover and mutation operations, particularly in
applications sensitive to probabilistic rates.
