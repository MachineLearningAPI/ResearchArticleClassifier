Prediction of Cancer Behavior Based on
Artificial Intelligence
Shayma M. Al-Ani, Maysam Abbod

ANNs are complex neural networks providing a nonlinear
relationship of input-to-output results. Multi-layer ANNs
comprise of an input layer, a hidden layer and an output layer
as illustrated in Fig. 1. Basically, the input layer provides an
input value to the network and each of the input cells has a
weighting factor, which identifies the effect of the cell on the
network[6]. As for the hidden and output cells, they represent a
function where the hidden layer is first computed, and then the
results are used in computing the output layer.

Abstract— Cancer has been one of the most famous conditions
discussed and researched about throughout the human history. Some
of the earliest medical records regarding cancer are dated back to
around 1600 BC. Cancer is a general condition which is subdivided
into a group of conditions that are concerned with an abnormal
growth in the cells within an organ or a tissue with the chance of
spreading and invading other parts of the body. Nowadays, there is a
growing number of cancer patients and with this increase arises the
necessity for new techniques to accurately diagnose and predict
cancer in its different forms and thus playing a huge part in improving
the quality of life. Moreover, techniques that depend on the principle
of intelligent systems and artificial neural networks are proven to be
very efficient in the field of cancer research.

Keywords—ANN, Cancer prediction, Ensemble model.
I. INTRODUCTION

C

ANCER has been known all the way through human
history. Other names for cancer are malignant tumor or
malignant neoplasm [1]. Genetic heritage, tobacco and alcohol
intake, obesity, radiation exposure as well as having a poor and
inactive lifestyle are some causes for abnormal cell growth and
thus providing higher risks of getting cancer. For such reasons,
cancer is considered as one of the most dangerous and
unpredictable diseases nowadays. Much of research is done on
the prevention of cancer and cancer treatment [2]. Innovative
and modern technology is being implemented in the goal of
providing proper diagnosis, prediction and in some cases
treatments for cancer. Artificial intelligence is one of the
methods for approaching cancer and understanding its nature
[3]. One of the most popular types of cancer being approached
by artificial intelligence is breast cancer in females.

Fig. 1 Artificial neural network model.

The data presented in this paper is patients suffering from
bladder cancer . This database is obtained for xx patient, each
patient is represented with different information as input data
such as the type of tumor, patient details (sex, age, tobacco
consumption) in addition to protein expression (p53, msh2,
mlh1) and DNA mutations (bat25, bat26, mfd15, apc,
d2s123). Furthermore, the output data will be represented with
the actual behavior of the tumor such as how long did and how
many times the tumor went back to appear. In addition the
time it took to advance to other stages, the time the cancer
spread and lead to patient’s death and whether or not the
cancer was the cause of death or there might be other causes of
death (e.g. complications).

An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is an imitation to the
basic human brain operation and it is an interconnected
neurons system that is capable of computing values using
mathematical functions in which they determine the activation
of the neuron[4][5]. To adapt to the environmental changes, a
learning system has to change itself. In addition, Multi-layers

The proposed ANN based prediction algorithm accurately
predicts the patient’s cancer records output by employing the
ensemble method shown in Table I. In In this method, the
patient’s record is equally divided into 10 window groups. In
15

New Developments in Circuits, Systems, Signal Processing, Communications and Computers

this method, the average of 10 ANN network functions under
different combinations of 10 window groups have been used in
order to find out the predicted output, in addition to improving
the prediction performance of a model with more accurate
results.

Output performances of the proposed algorithms are
analysed using various parameters such as Sensitivity,
Specificity, Accuracy, Receiver Operator Curve (ROC), Area
Under the Curve (AUC) and Mean Square Error (MSE) value.
Regression model is a statistical model for estimating the
relationships among variables. It includes many techniques for
modeling and analyzing several variables and statistical
models to compare it with the ANN model, output
performances of them are analysed using various parameters
like Sensitivity, Specificity, Accuracy, Roc, AUC and MSE
value.

The proposed model is trained by using three different ANN
networks which are cascade-forward back propagation
network (NEWCF), feed-forward input time-delay back
propagation network (NEWFFTD), and fitting network
(NEWFIT), each network is trained by using ensemble
methods under different combination of groups by applying
two methods which are the averaging and voting methods.
The averaging method is one of the major types of static
committee machines. The network design for such method
depends upon mean average of the networks. In addition,
ensemble averaging depends on the mean average networks
results. So in general, the whole idea of averaging method can
be summarized by the following; generating N experts each
having their initial values which are chosen from a random
distribution. After that, each expert will be separately trained
separately and finally, they are combined and their values are
averaged.

III. FINDINGS
The proposed ANN models are trained using three different
ANN networks, namely NEWCF, NEWFFTD and
NEWFIT[7][8]. First of all, randomly dividing the networks
into two groups called training records and testing
records[9][10][11]. Training records group contains about 70%
of the total records, which are used to train the ANN by using
80% for training and 20% for validation of the ANN networks.
The trained ANN networks are used to predict the output
parameter of testing records group which contain 30% of total
records .

As for the voting method, it does not consider the level of
significance by each network. This as a result, allows simple
integration of all different sorts of network architectures.
Majority voting is a simple voting method in which a group of
unlabeled instance are performed depending on the class with
the most frequent votes. This technique has been widely used
to compare newly proposed methods.

Moreover, three different methods have been used, average,
voting, and regression model[12][13][14]. Table II shows the
input variables used in the modeling analyses. Tables III and
IV show the performance of three methods for various ANN
training networks in which it follows the principle of 70%
training and 30% testing, while Tables V and VI show the
predicted patients records for three methods and three different
ANN trained networks using ensemble method.

Sensitivity relates to the test’s ability to identify positive
results which measures the proportion of actual positives
which are correctly identified as such.
While specificity relates to the test’s ability to identify
negative results, which measures the proportion of negatives
which are correctly identified.
The accuracy is the proportion of true results (both true
positive and true negative) in the population.

In the case of Artificial Neural Network model, the neuron
behaves as an activation function f(.) producing an output y =
f(net), where net is the cumulative input stimuli to the neuron
and f is typically a nonlinear function of net, where xi indicates
the inputs and wi indicate the weighting parameters.

Sensitivity=TP/(TP+FN)
Specificity=TN/(TN+FP)
Accuracy = (TP+TN)/ (TP+FP+TN+FN

IV. CONCLUSIONS
The proposed ensemble model, the artificial neural network
algorithm using two methods averaging, voting and for various
artificial neural network functions such as feed-forward input
time-delay back-propagation network, cascade-forward backpropagation network and radial basis network, successfully
and accurately predicted patient’s records. Output
performances of records are analyzed using various parameters
such as Sensitivity, Specificity, Accuracy, ROC, AUC and
MSE value and the results show that artificial neural network
methods obtain better predictive performance than could be
obtained from regression models and that was all based on the
different validations of the artificial neural networks.
