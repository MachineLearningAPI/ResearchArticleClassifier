ABSTRACT

RESUMEN

Forest fires importantly influence our
environment and lives. The ability of
accurately predicting the area that may
be involved in a forest fire event may
help in optimizing fire management efforts. Given the complexity of the
task, powerful computational tools are
needed for predicting the amount of
area that will be burned during a forest
fire. The purpose of this study was to
develop an intelligent system based on
genetic programming for the prediction
of burned areas, using only data related
to the forest under analysis and meteorological data. We used geometric semantic genetic programming based on
recently defined geometric semantic
genetic operators for genetic programming. Experimental results, achieved
using a database of 517 forest fire
events between 2000 and 2003, showed
the appropriateness of the proposed
system for the prediction of the burned
areas. In particular, results obtained
with geometric semantic genetic programming were significantly better
than those produced by standard genetic programming and other state of the
art machine learning methods on both
training and out-of-sample data. This

INTRODUCTION
Forest fires are well-known events, especially during summer. Forest fires, regularly
experienced in regions with hot, dry, or mediterranean climates, represent a risk to life and
extant infrastructure. In Portugal, there are
typically between 15 000 and 25 000 forest
fires each year (Mateus and Fernandes 2014),
burning from 150 000 ha to 250 000 ha. Notwithstanding the fact that these fires can cause
extensive economic damage (typically with
tangible repercussions for many years to
come), they also threaten human life. Furthermore, the aftermath of forest fires can have
other far-reaching consequences. For example, many physical, chemical, mineralogical,
and biological soil properties can be affected
by forest fires (Certini 2005). Negative effects
resulting from high levels of burn severity include significant removal of organic matter,
deterioration of both soil structure and porosity, considerable loss of nutrients through volatilization, ash entrapment in smoke columns,
leaching, and erosion. Also, the release of
hazardous chemicals significantly impacts human health and increases the risk of future diseases. As suggested by Lipsett et al. (2008),
wildfire smoke is accompanied by high concentrations of carbon dioxide, which can result
in consequences such as headache, mental
confusion, nausea, disorientation, coma, and
even death. Even at lower concentrations, the
effects of carbon dioxide should not be neglected; individuals with cardiovascular dis-

ease may experience chest pain and cardiac arrhythmia. A comprehensive study tracking
wildfire firefighter deaths from 1990 to 2006
reported that 21.9 % of their deaths occurred
from heart attacks (Mangan 2007).
The ability to predict fire progression and
area burned is crucial to mitigating the immediate and far-reaching consequences of wildfires. Existing studies have attempted to fill
this gap, mainly through mathematical models
(e.g. Rothermel 1972), but predictive techniques would enable decision makers to deal
with large amount of data in a more timely
manner. The Wildland Fire Management Research, Development & Application Organization (2012) proposed a wildland fire decision
support tool called FSPro (Fire Spread Probability). FSPro is a geospatial probabilistic
model that predicts fire growth, and is designed to support long-term (more than five
days) decision making. FSPro addresses fire
growth beyond the timeframes of reliable
weather forecasts by using historic climatological data. FSPro calculates and maps the probability that fire will spread to areas on the
landscape based on the current fire perimeter
or ignition point.
In this paper, we propose an intelligent
system based on genetic programming for the
prediction of burned areas of forest fires. In
order to build predictive models, we only considered data relating to forest characteristics
and meteorological data. Drawing on the idea
of using computational intelligence techniques
(and genetic programming in particular; e.g.

Page 108

Brumby et al. 2001, Manson 2005), we employed recently defined geometric semantic
genetic operators for genetic programming,
which were able to produce results significantly better than traditional methods.
Genetic Programming

Genetic Programming (GP) (Koza 1992;
Poli et al. 2008) belongs to the family of
bio-inspired computational intelligence techniques. The main idea of GP is to mimic the
biological evolutionary process in order to create, by stepwise iteration, more refined solutions to a given problem.
In GP, candidate solutions are represented
using a tree structure (Figure 1). In order to
create new solutions, GP uses stochastic operators called genetic operators, typically entitled crossover and mutation. In the standard
version of GP, these two operators work as follows: given two solutions (called parents),
crossover builds two new solutions (offspring)
by swapping a subtree of the first parent with a
subtree of the second parent. The subtrees are
usually chosen at random. Mutation acts on
one solution: given a tree, it creates a new
solution by replacing a randomly chosen subtree with a newly generated subtree. These
operators act on the structure (i.e., the syntax)
of the individuals and ignore the information
related to semantics. The application of standard crossover and mutation operators yields
new tree structures (Figures 2 and 3).

Figure 1. The genetic programming iterative
search process.

Figure 2. Example of the application of the standard, syntax-based, crossover operator. Given two
solutions (called parents), the crossover operator
builds two new solutions (offspring) by swapping
a subtree of the first parent with a subtree of the
second parent. The subtrees are usually chosen at
random.

Since its definition, GP has been used to
solve complex problems in several domains
(Koza 2010) using only syntax-based genetic
operators. Abstraction from semantics allows
GP to use simple genetic operators that are
easy to define and that are independent of any
particular application. Hence, standard genetic operators can be used for addressing regression, classification, or even clustering problems without changing their definition. A second advantage is the existence of a solid theory that guarantees asymptotic convergence of
standard GP towards optimal solutions (Poli
and Langdon 1998). Nevertheless, relying on
syntax-based genetic operators results in some
difficulties: abstraction from the semantics
will produce solutions that completely ignore
the knowledge associated with the available
data, and it is difficult for an expert of a particular domain to accept and adopt a model built
without considering this information. To offset this limitation, researchers have recently
focused on the definition of methods that are
able to integrate the semantic information in
the search process.

tree, the mutation operator creates a new solution
by replacing a randomly chosen subtree with a
newly generated subtree.
Geometric Semantic Operators

This section introduces the concepts related to the definition of semantic-based methods, describing the semantic genetic operators
that were used in this study. Even though the
term semantics can have several different interpretations, the most common interpretation
(and the one used here) is to identify the semantics of a solution with the vector of its output values on the training data (Vanneschi et

Castelli et al.: Predicting Burned Areas of Forest Fires
Page 109

al. 2014). From this perspective, a GP individual can be identified with a point (its semantics) in a multidimensional space known
as semantic space. The term Geometric Semantic Genetic Programming (GS-GP) indicates a variant of GP in which traditional
crossover and mutation operators are replaced
by so-called geometric semantic operators,
which exploit semantic awareness and induce
precise geometric properties on the semantic
space.
Geometric semantic operators, introduced
by Moraglio et al. (2012), are becoming more
and more popular in the GP community
(Vanneschi et al. 2014) because of their property of inducing a unimodal fitness landscape
on any problem consisting of matching sets of
input data into known targets (e.g., supervised
learning problems such as regression and
classification).
To understand this property (for a full
proof see Moraglio et al. 2012), let us first
consider a Genetic Algorithms (GAs) problem
in which the unique global optimum is known
and the fitness of each individual (to be minimized) corresponds to its distance to that global optimum (our reasoning holds for any employed distance). In this problem, if we use,
for instance, ball mutation (Krawiec and Lichocki 2009) (i.e., a variation operator that
slightly perturbs some of the coordinates of a
solution), then any possible individual different from the global optimum has at least one
fitter neighbor (another individual resulting
from its mutation). Similar considerations
hold also for many types of crossover, including various kinds of geometric crossover
(Krawiec and Lichocki 2009). Accordingly,
there are no local optima other than the global
optimum, and the fitness landscape is unimodal, resulting in a problem characterized by a
good evolvability.
Now, let us consider the typical GP problem of finding a function that maps sets of input data into known target values (e.g., regression and classification). The fitness of an indi-

Castelli et al.: Predicting Burned Areas of Forest Fires

Fire Ecology Volume 11, Issue 1, 2015
doi: 10.4996/fireecology.1101106

vidual for this problem is typically considered
to be represented as a distance between its predicted output values and the target ones (an error measure). Geometric semantic operators
simply define transformations on the syntax of
the individuals that correspond to geometric
crossover and ball mutation in the semantic
space, thus allowing us to map the considered
GP problem into the previously discussed GA
problem.
The definitions of semantic crossover and
semantic mutation follow.
Geometric semantic crossover. Given two
parent functions T1, T2: Rn → R, the geometric
semantic crossover returns the real function
TXO = (T1 · TR) + ((1 − TR) · T2) ,

(1)

where TR is a random function such that TR: Rn
→ [0, 1].
To constrain TR in producing values in [0;
1] we use the sigmoid function
�� �

1

1 � � ������

  ,

(2)

where Trand is a random tree with no constraints on the output values.
Geometric semantic mutation. Given a
parent function T: Rn → R, the geometric semantic mutation with mutation step ms returns
the real function
TM = T + ms · (TR1 − TR2) ,

(3)

where TR1 and TR2 are random real functions.
Moraglio et al. (2012) showed that geometric semantic crossover corresponds to geometric crossover in semantic space (i.e., the
point representing the offspring stands on the
segment joining the points representing the
parents), and geometric semantic mutation
corresponds to ball mutation on the semantic
space (and thus induces a unimodal fitness

landscape on the above mentioned types of
problem). Moraglio et al. (2012) further
showed that these operators create much larger
offspring than their parents and the fast growth
of the individuals in the population makes fitness evaluation unbearably slow, making the
system unusable. Vanneschi et al. (2013) and
Castelli et al. (2014) proposed a possible solution to this problem, consisting of an implementation of the Moraglio et al. (2012) operators that makes them not only usable in practice, but also very efficient. Their implementation is based on the idea that, besides storing
the initial trees, at every generation it is
enough to maintain in memory, for each individual, its semantics and a reference to its parents. Vanneschi et al. (2013) showed that the
computational cost of evolving a population of
n individuals for g generations is O(ng), while
the cost of evaluating a new, unseen instance is
O(g).
Geometric semantic operators have a
known limitation (Castelli et al. 2014; Vanneschi et al. 2014): the reconstruction of the best
individual at the end of a run can be a difficult
(and sometimes even impossible) task, due to
its large size. As a result, the interpretation of
the optimal GP individual can be difficult, and
the system can come to resemble a black box .
METHODS
To test the GP-GS method on a fire-frequent region, we selected Montesinho Natural
Park, a protected area located in the municipalities of Vinhais and Bragança, in the mountainous region of northeast Portugal (Figure
4). The park consists of 748 000 ha of natural
wooded landscape and traditional mountain
agricultural landscape, with highly variable
gradients. The park lies in the northeast Trásos-Montes plateau, part of the northern Iberian
Meseta, with elevations generally from 750 m
to 900 m (Castro et al. 2010). However, in
Montesinho, the elevation range is more than
1000 m: from the lowest point in the River

Mente (436 m), which is the park’s western
border, to peak of Sierra de Montesinho, at
1487 m. The main altitudinal belts correspond
to the main landforms found in the area. Climatic diversity within the park is high, with a
mean annual rainfall of 800 mm to 1500 mm
and an average annual temperature of 8 ºC to
13 ºC; this variation follows continental and altitudinal gradients (Raínha and Fernandes
2002). The summer drought period is usually
four months. Vegetation is dominated by extensive shrub land areas, with important and
flammable pine plantations (Pinus pinaster Aiton, P. nigra J.F. Arnold, and P. sylvestris L.).
Natural hardwood stands (Quercus rotundifolia Lam., Q. faginea Lam., and Q. pyrenaica

Willd.) occur as residual patches in the landscape (Castro et al. 2010). Schist is the most
widely represented soil parent material in the
area, but basic rocks, ultramafic rocks, granites, and migmatites are also important lithological groups (Fonseca et al. 2012). The spatial distribution of the soil groups is characterized by the strong dominance of Leptosols
(77.1 %), followed by Cambisols (20.1 %),
with the well-developed soils (Luvisols and
Alisols) covering 2 % of the territory.
The park includes 92 small villages inhabited by less than 8000 people. Intensive grazing takes place from May to August when
about 5000 sheep are transported from the surrounding lowlands to graze in the highlands.

The non-regulated use of fire is common and
related to agricultural and pastoral activities.
Consequently, this area is very often subjected
to wildfires, either naturally ignited or as a result of escaped human ignitions.
Data

We created a database of wildfire activity
within the boundaries of the Montesinho Natural Park from January 2000 to December 2003,
comprising 517 wildfires. Fuel and meteorological data related to the fires included the
forest Fire Weather Index (FWI) (Taylor and
Alexander 2006), which is the Canadian system for rating fire danger and includes five
components: Fine Fuel Moisture Code
(FFMC), Duff Moisture Code (DMC),
Drought Code (DC), Initial Spread Index (ISI),
and Buildup Index (BUI). The first three are
related to fuel codes and are measured at the
beginning of the year by means of a ground
surveythe FFMC denotes the moisture con-

tent of surface litter and influences ignition
and fire spread, while the DMC and DC represent the moisture content of shallow and deep
organic layers, which affect fire intensity. The
ISI is a score that correlates with fire spread,
while BUI represents the amount of available
fuel. Although different scales are used for
each of the FWI elements, high values suggest
more severe burning conditions (Taylor and
Alexander 2006).
For each forest fire, several attributes were
registered on a daily basis, such as the time,
date, spatial location, the type of vegetation involved, the five components of the FWI system, and the total burned area (Table 1). More
precisely, the areas affected by the fires were
assessed by the park’s personnel, using ground
survey with GPS and false color aerial photography. The FWI components were calculated
using meteorological information measured
every 30 min by an automatic weather station
located in the center of Montesinho Natural
Park. Temperature, relative humidity, and

wind speed were averages calculated during
the time the fire was burning. Rain information was the total amount of rain during the
time the fire burned. The full dataset of 517
instances is available at: https://archive.ics.uci.
edu/ml/datasets/Forest+Fires, and a complete
description of the data can be found in Cortez
and Morais (2007).
Following the same procedure reported in
Cortez and Morais (2007), month and day of
the week have been chosen as temporal variables. The day of the week could influence
forest fires (e.g., workdays vs. weekends),
considering that most fires have a human
cause. The BUI was discarded, since it is dependent on the other values (FFMC, DMC,
DC, and ISI). Regarding the meteorological
data, only the weather attributes used by the
FWI system have been considered.
Experimental Settings

We tested the proposed implementation of
GP with geometric semantic operators (GS-GP
from now on), and we compared it to a standard GP system (ST-GP) (i.e., to the system
that was originally defined in Koza 1992). All
of the parameters were obtained by means of a
preliminary tuning experimental analysis. We
performed a total of 50 runs with each technique. In each run, a different partition between training and test data was considered.
All the runs used populations of 100 individuals and the evolution was stopped after 500
generations. Tree initialization was performed
with the Ramped Half-and-Half method (Koza
1992) with a maximum initial depth of six.
The function set contained arithmetic operators, including division protected by returning
a numeric constant when the denominator was
equal to zero, a well-known method proposed
in Koza (1992) to avoid system failures due to
failures in the evaluation of the individuals.
Fitness was calculated as the mean absolute
error (MAE) between predicted and target values, defined as:

���

where yi is the predicted value given input i
(output of the generated model, evaluated on
the training data), and ti is the corresponding
target value.
The terminal set contained 12 variables,
each one corresponding to a different feature
in the dataset. To create new individuals, STGP used standard (subtree swapping) crossover and subtree mutation (Koza 1992) with
probabilities equal to 0.9 and 0.1, respectively.
For GS-GP, the crossover rate was 0.7, and the
mutation rate was 0.3. The mutation step parameter was 0.1. Survival from one generation to the other was always guaranteed to the
best individual of the population (elitism). No
maximum tree depth limit was imposed during
the evolution.
RESULTS
GS-GP vs. Standard GP

GS-GP outperformed ST-GP both on training and on out-of-samples data (Figure 5).
GS-GP returned a MAE of 12.0 on the training
set, whereas ST-GP produced a MAE of 13.8.
GS-GP was more explanatory on the test data,
with a MAE of 12.9, compared to ST-GP,
which produced a MAE of 21.0.
To examine the statistical significance of
these results, we tested the median errors. Preliminary analysis using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test showed that the data were not
normally distributed and hence a rank-based
statistic was used. The Wilcoxon rank-sum test
for pairwise data comparison was used with the
alternative hypothesis that the samples do not
have equal medians of burned area (P < 0.001
for training data, P = 0.002 for test data).

GS-GP vs. Other Machine Learning
Techniques

Besides comparing GS-GP with ST-GP, we
also compared GS-GP with other well-known
state-of-the-art machine learning methods. To
perform the comparisons with other machine
learning methods, we used the implementations provided by the Weka public domain
software (Machine Learning Project 2015).
As we did for the previous experimental phase,

we performed a preliminary analysis to tune
the parameters for each considered techniques.

gree, NN refers to feed-forward artificial neural networks, trained with the backpropagation
learning rule (Gurney 2003) and RF refers to
random forests (Breiman 2001). Median error
values for GS-GP were lower than those of all
other considered methods (Table 2). There
was a marked difference between the various
methods: GS-GP, SVM-2, and RF performed
well on this problem; LIN, RBF, and ISO performed less well; and NN performed poorly.
We speculate, therefore, that the relationships
hidden in the data cannot be satisfactorily approximated by a linear model. This speculation is supported by the fact that GS-GP, RF
(which can generate non-linear models), and
SVM-2 (which uses a quadratic kernel, and
thus produces non-linear models) outperformed LIN, RBF, and ISO. The poor performance of NN on this problem deserves further
discussion. One possible reason for the poor
performance of NN could be due to the high
number of unexpected events that affect some

particular instances of the data in the studied
problem. NN has difficulty integrating these
elements of discontinuities.
To assess the statistical significance of the
model comparisons, the same set of tests performed in the previous section were done, but
with a Bonferroni correction for the standard α
= 0.05 was applied (hence, the final value of α
was 0.014). The differences in terms of training and test fitness between GS-GP and the
considered machine learning techniques were
significant, except for the cases when GS-GP
and SVM-2 were compared as well as when
GS-GP and RF were compared (Table 3).
CONCLUSIONS
The new genetic operators of genetic programming, called geometric semantic operators, have the extremely interesting property of
inducing a unimodal fitness landscape for any
problem consisting of matching input data into

known output values (regression and classification are instances of this general problem).
Here we showed a new intelligent GP-based
system that makes use of these operators to examine burned area. The main objective was
the development of a system for predicting the
amount of area that will be burned during a
forest fire, based on explicit relationships between meteorological data, forest-related data,

and the amount of burned area. The comparatively small MAE obtained from experimental
results showed that geometric semantic genetic programming outperforms standard genetic
programming and produces results that are
better or comparable to the ones achieved with
state-of-the-art machine learning methods for
