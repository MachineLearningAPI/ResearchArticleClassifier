Being able to forecast time series accurately has been quite a popular subject for researchers both in the
past and at present. However, the lack of ability of conventional analysis methods to forecast time series
that are not smooth leads the scientists and researchers to resort to various forecasting models that have
different mathematical backgrounds, such as artiﬁcial neural networks, fuzzy predictors, evolutionary
and genetic algorithms. In this paper, the accuracies of different grey models such as GM(1,1), Grey Verhulst model, modiﬁed grey models using Fourier Series is investigated. Highly noisy data, the United
States dollar to Euro parity between the dates 01.01.2005 and 30.12.2007, are used to compare the performances of the different models. The simulation results show that modiﬁed grey models have higher
performances not only on model ﬁtting but also on forecasting. Among these grey models, the modiﬁed
GM(1,1) using Fourier series in time is the best in model ﬁtting and forecasting.

1. Introduction
A time series is a collection of data points which are generally
sampled equally in time intervals. Time series prediction refers
to the process by which the future values of a system is forecasted
based on the information obtained from the past and current data
points. Generally, a pre-deﬁned mathematical model is used to
make accurate predictions. Time series prediction models are
widely used in ﬁnancial area, such as predicting stock price indexes, foreign currency exchange rates (FX rates) and so on. The
ability to do prediction with a reasonable accuracy can change
the economic policy of large companies and governments and ensure a more reasonable behavior by the ﬁnancial actors.
Statistical and artiﬁcial intelligence (soft computing) based approaches are the two main techniques for time series prediction
seen in the literature. While AR (Auto Regressive), MA (Moving
Average), ARMA (Auto Regressive Moving Average), ARIMA (Auto
Regressive Integrated Moving Average) and Box–Jenkins models
(Box & Jenkins, 1976) can be mentioned as statistical models, neural network (NN) based models (Quah & Srinivasan, 1999; Rabiner,
1989; Roman & Jameel, 1996) are widely used as an artiﬁcial intelligence-based approach, back propagation being the most widely
used technique for updating the parameters of the model. However, not only are the statistical models not as accurate as the neural network-based approaches for nonlinear problems, they may be
too complex to be used in predicting future values of a time series.

One major criticism about the NN model is that it demands a great
deal of training data and relatively long training period for robust
generalization (Jo, 2003). Other intelligent approaches seen in the
literature for the analysis of time series include Linear regression,
Kalman ﬁltering (Ma & Teng, 2004), fuzzy systems (Kandel,
1991), hidden markov models (Rabiner, 1989) and the support vector machines (Cao, 2003). Some hybrid models are also seen in the
literature: in Versace, Bhatt, Hinds, and Shiffer (2004), a combination of genetic algorithms and neural networks has been proposed.
In Huang and Tsai (2009), support vector regression (SVR) and a
self-organizing feature map (SOFM) technique have been hybridized to reduce the cost of training time and to improve prediction
accuracies. High-order fuzzy logical relationships and genetic-simulated annealing techniques are combined in Lee, Wang, and Chen
(2008) for temperature prediction and the Taiwan futures exchange (TAIFEX) forecasting, where genetic-simulated annealing
techniques have been used to adjust the length of each interval
in the universe of discourse to increase the forecasting accuracy.
FX rates are highly nonlinear, stochastic and highly non-stationary ﬁnancial time series, and as such, it is very difﬁcult to ﬁt a model to them by the use conventional linear statistical methods or
artiﬁcial neural networks. In this paper, the use of grey prediction
theory is proposed to alleviate the problem.
Grey system theory is an interdisciplinary scientiﬁc area that
was ﬁrst introduced in early 1980s by Deng (1982). Since then,
the theory has become quite popular with its ability to deal with
the systems that have partially unknown parameters. As a superiority to conventional statistical models, grey models require only a
limited amount of data to estimate the behavior of unknown
systems (Deng, 1989).

E. Kayacan et al. / Expert Systems with Applications 37 (2010) 1784–1789

During the last two decades, the grey system theory has been
developed rapidly and caught the attention of many researchers.
It has been widely and successfully applied to various systems such
as social, economic, ﬁnancial, scientiﬁc and technological, agricultural, industrial, transportation, mechanical, meteorological, ecological, hydrological, geological, medical, military, etc., systems.
Some research studies in ﬁnancial area are as follows: In one study
(Wang, 2002), the combination of fuzziﬁcation techniques and the
grey system theory (GM(1,1) model with adaptive stepsize) is proposed to predict stock prices and it is shown that the approach is
very efﬁcient. In another study, the moving average autoregressive
exogenous (ARX) prediction model is combined with grey predictors for time series prediction in Huang and Jane (2009), and it is
proved that the hybrid method has a greater forecasting accuracy
than the GM(1,1) method. Another study (Chang & Tsai, 2008)
introduces a support vector regression grey model (SVRGM) which
combines support vector regression (SVR) learning algorithm and
grey system theory to obtain a better approach to time series prediction. In these studies and the others, it is seen that grey system
theory-based approaches can achieve good performance characteristics when applied to real-time systems, since grey predictors
adapt their parameters to new conditions as new outputs become
available. Because of this reason, grey predictors are more robust
with respect to noise and lack of modeling information when compared to conventional methods.
The spread of this new theory has taken place as follows: In
early 1990s, some universities located in Australia, China, Japan,
Taiwan, USA, have started offering courses on grey system theory. Chinese Grey System Association (CGSA) was established
in 1996. A conference on grey system theory and applications
is held by CGSA every year. For dissemination of research results,
an academic periodical; ‘‘The Journal of Grey System” is started
to be published in England in 1989. Additionally, more than
300 different academic periodicals accept and publish the grey
system related articles in the world (Liu & Lin, 1998). When
all the literature above is investigated, it can be seen that grey
system theory has aroused the interest of the scientists mostly
from the far eastern countries since it was introduced into the
scientiﬁc arena. Almost all the journal and conference papers
have been published by eastern scientists; the scientists from
the Western world have, to date, given only a limited attention
to this theory. Although a number of academic books and lecture
notes written in eastern languages can be found in the literature,
there are only two books in English which are also written by
eastern scientists.
In systems theory, a system can be deﬁned with a color that
represents the amount of clear information about that system.
For instance, a system can be called as a black box if its internal
characteristics or mathematical equations that describe its dynamics are completely unknown. On the other hand if the description
of the system is, completely known, it can be named as a white system. Similarly, a system that has both known and unknown information is deﬁned as a grey system. In real life, every system can be
considered as a grey system because there are always some uncertainties. Due to noise from both inside and outside of the system of
our concern (and the limitations of our cognitive abilities!), the
information we can reach about that system is always uncertain
and limited in scope (Lin & Liu, 2004).
There are many situations in which the difﬁculty of incomplete
or insufﬁcient information is faced. Even a simple motor control
system always contains some grey characteristics due to the
time-varying parameters of the system and the measurement difﬁculties. Similarly, it is difﬁcult to forecast the electricity consumption of a region accurately because of the various kinds of social
and economic factors. These factors are generally random and
make it difﬁcult to obtain an accurate model.

2. Fundamental concepts of grey system theory
2.1. Grey system based prediction
Grey models predict the future values of a time series based
only on a set of the most recent data depending on the window size
of the predictor. It is assumed that all data values to be used in grey
models are positive, and the sampling frequency of the time series
is ﬁxed. From the simplest point of view, grey models which will be
formulated below can be viewed as curve ﬁtting approaches.
2.2. Generations of grey sequences
The main task of grey system theory is to extract realistic
governing laws of the system using available data. This process
is known as the generation of the grey sequence (Liu & Lin,
1998).
It is argued that even though the available data of the system,
which are generally white numbers, is too complex or chaotic, they
always contain some governing laws. If the randomness of the data
obtained from a grey system is somehow smoothed, it is easier to
derive any special characteristics of that system.
For instance, the following sequence that represents the price of
a product might be given:

X ð0Þ ¼ ð820; 840; 835; 850; 890Þ:
It is obvious that the sequence does not have a clear regularity.
If accumulating generation suggested in grey system theory is applied to this sequence, X ð1Þ is obtained which has a clear growing
tendency.

X ð1Þ ¼ ð820; 1660; 2495; 3345; 4235Þ:
2.3. GM(n,m) model
In grey systems theory, GM(n,m) denotes a grey model, where n
is the order of the difference equation and m is the number of variables. Although various types of grey models can be mentioned,
most of the previous researchers have focused their attention on
GM(1,1) models in their predictions because of its computational
efﬁciency. It should be noted that in real time applications, the
computational burden is the most important parameter after the
performance.
2.4. GM(1,1) model
GM(1,1) type of grey model is the most widely used in the literature, pronounced as ‘‘Grey Model First Order One Variable”. This
model is a time series forecasting model. The differential equations
of the GM(1,1) model have time-varying coefﬁcients. In other
words, the model is renewed as the new data become available
to the prediction model.
The GM(1,1) model can only be used in positive data sequences
(Deng, 1989). In this paper, since all the primitive data points are
positive, grey models can be used to forecast the future values of
the primitive data points.
In order to smooth the randomness, the primitive data obtained
from the system to form the GM(1,1) is subjected to an operator,
named Accumulating Generation Operator (AGO) (Deng, 1989).
The differential equation (i.e. GM(1,1)) is solved to obtain the
n-step ahead predicted value of the system. Finally, using the predicted value, the Inverse Accumulating Generation Operator
(IAGO) is applied to ﬁnd the predicted values of original data.
Consider a time sequence X ð0Þ that denotes the price of a
product in USD (see Fig. 1)

The Verhulst model was ﬁrst introduced by a German biologist
Pierre Franois Verhulst. The main purpose of Velhulst model is to
limit the whole development for a real system and it is effective
in describing some increasing processes, such as an S-curve which
has a saturation region.

2.6. GM(1,1) rolling model
GM(1,1) rolling model is based on the forward data of sequence
to build the GM(1,1). For instance, using xð0Þ ðkÞ; xð0Þ ðk þ 1Þ; xð0Þ
ðk þ 2Þ and xð0Þ ðk þ 3Þ, the model predicts the value of the next
point xð0Þ ðk þ 4Þ. In the next steps, the ﬁrst point is always shifted
to the second. It means that xð0Þ ðk þ 1Þ; xð0Þ ðk þ 2Þ; xð0Þ ðk þ 3Þ and
xð0Þ ðk þ 4Þ are used to predict the value of xð0Þ ðk þ 5Þ. This procedure is repeated till the end of the sequence and this method is
called rolling check (Wen, 2004).
GM(1,1) rolling model is used to predict the long continuous
data sequences such as the outputs of a system, price of a speciﬁc
product, trend analysis for ﬁnance statements or social parameters.

The prediction of the foreign currency exchange rates (FX rates)
is a very important topic in ﬁnancial area. The estimated daily trading volume of FX rates is about 1 trillion US dollars (Hussain,
Knowles, Lisboa, & El-Deredy, 2008) On the other hand, it is very
difﬁcult to develop good mathematical models and thus make
accurate predictions for FX rates, because of the fact that the statistical properties of the data change over time (Magdon-ismail, Nicholson, & Abu-mustafa, 1998).
Time series prediction in ﬁnancial area is generally very difﬁcult
because of the factors listed below (Hussain et al., 2008):

ð25Þ

It is obvious that T will be an integer number and z will be selected as an integer number (Guo et al., 2005).

1. The statistical properties of the data change over time
(Nonstationary).
2. It is difﬁcult to use mathematical prediction models with linear
parameters (Nonlinearity).
3. Random, day-to-day variations (Highly noisy).

4.2. Moving Average Filter (MAF)
MAF is the most common ﬁlters in signal processing in order to
reduce the random noise because of its simple structure. In this
study, a MAF with different window sizes is used to make the
primitive data smoother. By this way, the effect of MAFs on different grey models are investigated. The impulse response of the ﬁlter

using a ﬁlter. Modiﬁed GM(1,1) models, TFGM(1,1) and EFGM(1,1),
are giving better performances when compared to GM(1,1) model
as expected. However, the performance of interpolation has increased more than the performance of extrapolation.
Tables 2 and 3 show that while the performances of GM(1,1)
models are decreasing, the performances of GVM models are
increasing when a moving average ﬁlter (MAF) has been used.
However, when the window size of the MAF is increased, the performance of GM(1,1) models has been decreased dramatically. This
is because while GVM models give better performances S-type

data, GM(1,1) models are good at monotonically increasing data
sets.
Table 4 is used to check the performances of GVM models when
the ﬁlter and prediction window size are increased. In this situation, GMV models give satisfactory performances both in interpolation and extrapolation. On the other hand, GM(1,1) models give
dramatically unsuccessful results.
5. Conclusion and future works
This paper compares the performances of the various modiﬁed
grey models in time series prediction. It is shown that the performance of the grey predictors can be further improved by taking
into account the error residuals. Highly noisy data, the United
States dollar to Euro parity, are used to show the efﬁciency of the
various error corrected grey models for this purpose. The model
accuracy examination results show that GM(1,1) model is able to
make accurate predictions for forecasting of the monotonous type
of processes. However, the model GM(1,1) cannot give the same
performance when the primitive data sequence increases like as
in an S-curve (like the data with a MAF used in this project) or it
has a saturation region. The simulation results show that modiﬁed
grey models have higher performances not only on model ﬁtting
but also on forecasting. Among these grey models, the modiﬁed
GM(1,1) using Fourier series in time is the best in model ﬁtting
and forecasting.
