The evaluation and selection of projects before investment decision is customarily done using, technical
and information. In this paper, proposed a new methodology to provide a simple approach to assess alternative projects and help the decision-maker to select the best one for National Iranian Oil Company by
using six criteria of comparing investment alternatives as criteria in an AHP and fuzzy TOPSIS techniques.
The AHP is used to analyze the structure of the project selection problem and to determine weights of the
criteria, and fuzzy TOPSIS method is used to obtain ﬁnal ranking. This application is conducted to illustrate the utilization of the model for the project selection problems. Additionally, in the application, it is
shown that calculation of the criteria weights is important in fuzzy TOPSIS method and they could change
the ranking. The decision-maker can use these different weight combinations in the decision-making process according to priority.

1. Introduction
Every project begins with a proposal, but not every proposal can
or should become a project. In a world of limited resources, choices
have to be made. Not every project has viability and amongst those
that do, limited resources (people, time, money and equipment),
must be applied judiciously. The goal of the project selection process is to analyze project viability and to approve or reject project
proposals based on established criteria, following a set of structured steps and checkpoints. Mehrez and Sinuany-Stern (1983) formulated a project selection problem as a multi-criteria decisionmaking (MCDM) problem and applied a utility function. Chu,
Hsu, and Fehling (1996) used a heuristic method based on the fuzzy
logic for ranking projects. The problem for the optimal project
funding implies decisions on the new projects and on the projects
to be continued. The decision on how to allocate the ﬁnancial resources between these two types of projects is very important issue
studied by Baker and Freeland (1975). Danila (1999) and Shpak and
Zaporojan (1996) surveyed a number of the project selection methodologies and discussed several multi-criteria aspects of the problem. Khorramshahgole and Steiner (1998) used goal programming
associated to a Delphi process for ﬁnding the utility map. Lockeett
and Straford (1987) presented several 0–1 mathematical programming models which take into account the hierarchical decisions
and the fund allocation problem between independent projects.
A different approach is based on the reference point and reference
level by Lewandowski and Grauer (1995) and Wierzbicki (1980)

the reference level is represented by a set of performance measures, which are associated to each attribute. The basic idea of
the method is to ﬁnd the nearest feasible non-dominated solution
from the point deﬁned by reference levels. Ghasemzadeh, Archer,
and Iyogun (1999) proposed a 0–1 integer linear programming
model for selecting and scheduling an optimal project portfolio,
based on the organization’s objectives and constraints. For a proper
and effective evaluation, the decision-maker may need a large
amount of data to be analyzed and many factors to be considered
(Ayag & Ozdemir, 2006; Kuma, Ordóñez, & Nasseriana, 2006).
This approach is employed for four reasons:
(1) TOPSIS logic is rational and understandable.
(2) The computation processes are straightforward.
(3) The concept permits the pursuit of best alternatives for each
criterion depicted in a simple mathematical form.
(4) The importance weights are incorporated into the comparison procedures (Wang & Chang, 2007).
This paper showed that AHP is used to analyze the structure of
the project selection problem and to determine weights of the criteria, and fuzzy TOPSIS method is used to obtain ﬁnal ranking.

2. Methods
2.1. The AHP method
AHP, developed by Saaty (1980), addresses how to determine
the relative importance of a set of activities in a multi-criteria

M.P. Amiri / Expert Systems with Applications 37 (2010) 6218–6224

decision problem. The process makes it possible to incorporate
judgments on intangible qualitative criteria alongside tangible
quantitative criteria (Badri, 2001). The AHP method is based on
three principles: ﬁrst, structure of the model; second, comparative
judgment of the alternatives and the criteria; third, synthesis of the
priorities. In the literature, AHP, has been widely used in solving
many complicated decision-making problems (Chan & Kumar,
2007; Dagdeviren & Yüksel, 2008; Kahraman, Ruan, & Dogan,
2003; Kulak & Kahraman, 2005). In the ﬁrst step, a complex decision problem is structured as a hierarchy. AHP initially breaks
down a complex multi-criteria decision-making problem into a
hierarchy of interrelated decision criteria, decision alternatives.
With the AHP, the objectives, criteria and alternatives are arranged
in a hierarchical structure similar to a family tree. A hierarchy has
at least three levels: overall goal of the problem at the top, multiple
criteria that deﬁne alternatives in the middle, and decision alternatives at the bottom (Albayrak & Erensal, 2004). The second step is
the comparison of the alternatives and the criteria. Once the problem has been decomposed and the hierarchy is constructed, prioritization procedure starts in order to determine the relative
importance of the criteria within each level. The pairwise judgment starts from the second level and ﬁnishes in the lowest level,
alternatives. In each level, the criteria are compared pairwise
according to their levels of inﬂuence and based on the speciﬁed criteria in the higher level (Albayrak & Erensal, 2004). In AHP, multiple pairwise comparisons are based on a standardized comparison
scale of nine levels (Table 1).
Let C = {Cj |j = 1, 2,...., n} be the set of criteria. The result of the
pairwise comparison on n criteria can be summarized in an (n_n)
evaluation matrix A in which every element aij (i,j = 1,2,..., n) is
the quotient of weights of the criteria, as shown:

At the last step, the mathematical process commences to normalize
and ﬁnd the relative weights for each matrix. The relative weights
are given by the right eigenvector (w) corresponding to the largest
Eigen value ðkmax Þ as:

Aw ¼ kmax w:

ð2Þ

If the pairwise comparisons are completely consistent, the matrix A has rank 1 and kmax ¼ n. In this case; weights can be obtained
by normalizing any of the rows or columns of A Wang and Yang,
2007. It should be noted that the quality of the output of the
AHP is strictly related to the consistency of the pairwise comparison judgments. The consistency is deﬁned by the relation between
the entries of A : aij Â ajk ¼ aik . The consistency index CI is:

CI ¼ ðkmax À nÞ=ðn À 1Þ:

The ﬁnal consistency ratio (CR), usage of which let someone to
conclude whether the evaluations are sufﬁciently consistent, is calculated as the ratio of the CI and the random index (RI), as
indicated.

CR ¼ CI=RI:

ð4Þ

The number 0.1 is the accepted upper limit for CR. If the ﬁnal
consistency ratio exceeds this value, the evaluation procedure has
to be repeated to improve consistency. The measurement of consistency can be used to evaluate the consistency of decision-makers as
well as the consistency of overall hierarchy (Wang & Yang, 2007).
2.2. The fuzzy TOPSIS method
The TOPSIS is widely used for tackling ranking problems in real
situations. This method is often criticized for its inability to adequately handle the inherent uncertainty and imprecision associated with the mapping of the decision-maker’s perception to
crisp values. In the traditional formulation of the TOPSIS, personal
judgments are represented with crisp values. However, in many
practical cases the human preference model is uncertain and decision-makers might be reluctant or unable to assign crisp values to
the comparison judgments (Chan & Kumar, 2007; Shyur & Shih,
2006). Having to use crisp values is one of the problematic points
in the crisp evaluation process. One reason is that decision-makers
usually feel more conﬁdent to give interval judgments rather than
expressing their judgments in the form of single numeric values. As
some criteria are difﬁcult to measure by crisp values, they are usually neglected during the evaluation. Another reason is mathematical models that are based on crisp value. These methods cannot
deal with decision-makers’ ambiguities, uncertainties and vagueness which cannot be handled by crisp values. The use of fuzzy
set theory (Zadeh, 1965) allows the decision-makers to incorporate
unquantiﬁable information, incomplete information; non-obtainable information and partially ignorant facts into decision model
(Kulak, Durmusoglu, & Kahraman, 2005). As a result, fuzzy TOPSIS
and its extensions are developed to solve ranking and justiﬁcation
problems (Büyükzkan, Feyzioglu, & Nebol, 2008; Chen & Tsao,
2007; Kahraman, Büyükzkan, & Ates, 2007; Onüt & Soner, 2007;
Wang & Elhag, 2006; Yong, 2006). This study uses triangular fuzzy
number for fuzzy TOPSIS. The reason for using a triangular fuzzy
number is that it is intuitively easy for the decision-makers to
use and calculate. In addition, modeling using triangular fuzzy
numbers has proven to be an effective way for formulating decision problems where the information available is subjective and
imprecise (Chang, Chung, & Wang, 2007; Chang & Yeh, 2002; Kahraman, Beskese, & Ruan, 2004; Zimmerman, 1996). In practical
applications, the triangular form of the membership function is
used most often for representing fuzzy numbers (Xu & Chen,
2007). In the following, some basic important deﬁnitions of fuzzy
sets are given (Raj & Kumar, 1999).

very useful in dealing with situations which are too complex or too
ill-deﬁned to be reasonably described in conventional quantitative

variable; its values are very low, low, medium, high, very high,
etc. These linguistic values can also be represented by fuzzy

3. The proposed model
The proposed model for the project selection problem, composed of AHP and fuzzy TOPSIS methods, consists of three basic
stages: (1) identify the criteria to be used in the model, (2) AHP
computations, (3) evaluation of alternatives with fuzzy TOPSIS
and determination of the ﬁnal rank. In the ﬁrst stage, alternative
projects and the criteria which will be used in their evaluation
are determined and the decision hierarchy is formed. AHP model
is structured such that the objective is in the ﬁrst level, criteria
are in the second level and alternative projects are on the third level. In the last step of the ﬁrst stage, the decision hierarchy is approved by decision-making team. After the approval of decision

hierarchy, criteria used in selection projects are assigned weights
using AHP in the second stage. In this phase, pairwise comparison
matrixes are formed to determine the criteria weights. The experts
from decision-making team make individual evaluations using the
scale provided in Table 1, to determine the values of the elements
of pairwise comparison matrixes. Computing the geometric mean
of the values obtained from individual evaluations, a ﬁnal pairwise
comparison matrix on which there is a consensus is found. The
weights of the criteria are calculated based on this ﬁnal comparison matrix. In the last step of this phase, calculated weights of
the criteria are approved by decision-making team. Project ranks

are determined by using fuzzy TOPSIS method in the third stage.
Linguistic values are used for evaluation of alternative projects in
this step. The membership functions of these linguistic values are
shown at (Fig. 2), and the triangular fuzzy numbers related with
these variables are shown in (Table 2). The selection project having
the maximum CCÃj value is determined as the optimal project
according to the calculations by fuzzy TOPSIS. Ranking of the other
project is determined according to CCÃj in descending order schematic. The criteria to be used in the model were determined by
the expert team from project managers in National Iranian Oil
Company. The application performed is based on the steps pro-

vided in Section 2 and explained step by step together with the results. Pairwise comparison matrices used to calculate criteria
weights were also formed by the same team. Diagram of the proposed model for project selection is provided in Fig. 3.

3.1. Identiﬁcation of criteria
Criteria to be considered in the selection of projects are determined by the expert team from National Iranian Oil Company.
These six criteria are as follows; size/complexity (C1), reasonableness of cost estimates (C2), scope–adequacy, level of detail (C3),
duration (C4), technology (C5), location (C6). As a result, only these
six criteria were used in evaluation and decision hierarchy is established accordingly (Table 3).

3.2. The weights of criteria
After forming the decision hierarchy for the problem, the
weights of the criteria to be used in evaluation process are calculated by using AHP method. In this phase, the experts in the expert
team are given the task of forming individual pairwise comparison
matrix by using the scale given in Table 1. Decision hierarchy
structured with the determined alternative projects and criteria
is provided in Fig. 4. Geometric means of these values are found
to obtain the pairwise comparison matrix on which there is a consensus (Table 4).

The results obtained from the computations based on the

Table 5.
Consistency ratio of the pairwise comparison matrix is calculated as 0.058 < 0.1. So the weights are shown to be consistent
and they are used in the selection process.
3.3. Evaluation of alternatives and determine the ﬁnal rank
At this stage, fuzzy evaluation matrix established by the evaluation of alternatives by linguistic variables in Table 2, is presented
in Table 6. Linguistic variables are in the upper section of Table 6,
the lower section is composed of the triangular fuzzy numbers
which are equivalent of linguistic variables. After the fuzzy evaluation matrix was determined, the second step is to obtain a fuzzy
weighted decision table. Using the criteria weights calculated by
AHP (Table 5) in this step, the Weighted Evaluation Matrix
(WEM) is established with Eq. (12). According to Table 7, it is seen

Finally, with using Table 8, the value of each alternative for ﬁnal
ranking will be:
Therefore, the ﬁnal ranking is:

A2 > A4 > A3 > A1 > A5:

4. Conclusion
The project selections process is a technique for evaluating the
basic suitable investment and to choose the best candidate by
using a multi-criteria approach that using linguistic preferences
can be very useful for uncertain situations. The AHP is used to analyze the structure of the project selection problem and to determine weights of the criteria, and fuzzy TOPSIS method is used to
obtain ﬁnal ranking. Similar calculations are done for the other

alternatives and the results of fuzzy TOPSIS analyses are summarized in Table 8. Based on CCj values, the ranking of the alternatives
in descending order are A2, A4, A3, A1 and A5. Proposed model results indicate that A2 is the best alternative with CC value of 0.386
(extension phases 3 – Khesht oil-ﬁeld). In the application, it is
shown that calculation of the criteria weights is important in fuzzy
TOPSIS method and they could change the ranking for other
project.
