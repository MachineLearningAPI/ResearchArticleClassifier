It is well known that ‘‘green’’ principles and strategies have become vital for companies as the public
awareness increased against their environmental impacts. A company’s environmental performance is
not only related to the company’s inner environmental efforts, but also it is affected by the suppliers’
environmental performance and image. For industries, environmentally responsible manufacturing,
return ﬂows, and related processes require green supply chain (GSC) and accompanying suppliers with
environmental/green competencies. During recent years, how to determine suitable and green suppliers
in the supply chain has become a key strategic consideration. Therefore this paper examines GSC management (GSCM) and GSCM capability dimensions to propose an evaluation framework for green suppliers. However, the nature of supplier selection is a complex multi-criteria problem including both
quantitative and qualitative factors which may be in conﬂict and may also be uncertain. The identiﬁed
components are integrated into a novel hybrid fuzzy multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) model
combines the fuzzy Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory Model (DEMATEL), the Analytical
Network Process (ANP), and Technique for Order Performance by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS)
in a fuzzy context. A case study is proposed for green supplier evaluation in a speciﬁc company, namely
Ford Otosan.

1. Introduction

improving quality and ﬂexibility to meet the needs of the customers, etc. For this reason, the aim of this study is to propose an
evaluation model to judge the appropriateness of suppliers for an
organization which has environmental goals and measure the
validity of the model with a real case study.
There are various mathematical techniques for evaluation of
suppliers, such as data envelopment analysis (DEA) (Wu, 2009),
heuristics (He, Chaudhry, Lei, & Baohua, 2009; Sen, Basßligil, S
ß en, &
Baraçli, 2007), analytic hierarchy process (AHP) (Sevkli, Koh, Zaim,
Demirbag, & Tatoglu, 2007), fuzzy AHP (Chan & Kumar, 2007; Lee
et al., 2009; Rao & Holt, 2005), fuzzy goal programming (Kumar,
Vrat, & Shankar, 2006; Tsai & Hung, 2009), fuzzy analytic network
process (ANP) (Lin, 2009; Tuzkaya & Önüt, 2008) in literature. For
the purpose of evaluating and selecting green suppliers, both qualitative and quantitative factors must be considered. Thus, green
supplier selection is a kind of multiple criteria decision making
(MCDM) problem and we need to employ MCDM methods to handle it appropriately. Here emphasis is placed on the relationships of
factors which can be handled by ANP (Saaty, 1996) effectively. The
ANP can deal with the dependence in feedback systematically. In
this study also Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory
(DEMATEL) method (Gabus & Fontela, 1972) is used to extract the
mutual relationships of interdependencies within criteria and the
strength of interdependence. Lastly to choose the alternative for
ideal solution of this problem, Technique for Order Performance

Money, components, processes and information ﬂows might
establish a supply chain management system but simultaneously,
due to government legislation and increasing awareness among
the people to protect the environment; ﬁrms today cannot ignore
environmental issues if they want to survive in the global market.
In this sense, green supply chain management (GSCM) has emerged
as a way for ﬁrms to achieve proﬁt and market share objectives by
lowering environmental impacts and increasing ecological efﬁciency (van Hock & Erasmus, 2000). In response to demands, companies have to ﬁnd ways to incorporate environmental and social
aspects into their supply chain management.
In order to reap the greatest beneﬁts from environmental management, ﬁrms must integrate all members in the green supply
chain (GSC) (Lee, Kang, Hsu, & Hung, 2009). Among these expectations, increasing attention is devoted to suppliers’ social responsibility with a particular focus on fair and legal use of natural
resources. Hence, strategic partnership with environmentally,
socially and economically powerful suppliers should be integrated
within the GSC for improving the performance in many directions
including reducing costs and lead time, eliminating wastages,

by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) is used. However it should
not be ignored that the fuzzy nature of human life makes these
kinds of MCDM analysis more difﬁcult. Yet for human being’s subjective judgment, a theory needed in measuring the ambiguity of
these concepts. Therefore, fuzzy logic (Zadeh, 1965) is used in evaluations that allows for uncertainty among factors.
Brieﬂy, fuzzy DEMATEL (Chen, Tseng, & Lin, 2008; Tseng, 2009a;
Wu & Lee, 2007); fuzzy ANP (Liu & Lai, 2009; Tuzkaya, Ozgen,
Ozgen, & Tuzkaya, 2009; Yüksel & Dag˘deviren, 2010); and fuzzy
_ &
TOPSIS (Salehi & Tavakkoli-Moghaddam, 2008; Yong, 2006; Iç
Yurdakul, 2010) approaches used by several authors are workable.
Because by applying these theories, it can be easy to discover
things inside the complex problem. In the literature there are some
works on these methods, but there is not any research that combines these three methods together. Thereby, this study proposes
a new integrated approach that could cope with the interdependencies among various criteria in fuzzy environment. Ford Otosan
is selected as a case company in this study for the evaluation of
green supplier alternatives. The supplied case study provides additional insights for research and practical applications.
The organization of the paper is then as follows. The paper
begins with the literature survey of GSCM. Then, after a brief
review of methodologies, various main components of the GSCM
are examined to structure a framework for green supplier evaluation. The next section includes the illustration of the proposed
green supplier methodology through the case of Ford Otosan. The
paper concludes with future directions.

2. Literature survey
Industrial production can have a great impact and damage on
the sustainability of the natural environment and human life such
as the impacts include depletive resource use, global environmental impacts, local environmental impacts, health impacts, and
safety risks. These environmental issues have received more and
more attention in recent years and supply chain operation with
sustainable consideration has become an increasingly important
issue. Thereby, these growing interest and importance to the supply function raise the importance of the environmental performance of suppliers (Faruk, Lamming, Cousins, & Bowen, 2002;
Hall, 2000; Sarkis, 2003; Simpson & Power, 2005). The beneﬁts to
the ﬁrm arising from advanced environmental management practice can include: cost reduction (efﬁcient use of raw materials,
reduction in ﬁnes, risks or insurance costs); quality improvement;
early adoption of new regulations; and better human resource
management practice (Simpson & Power, 2005; Theyel, 2001).
GSCs are gaining increasing interest among researchers and
practitioners. GSC is a broad concept that refers to a variety of
methods by which companies work with their suppliers to
improve and maintain the performance of their products or manufacturing processes of the suppliers, customers or both. The emergence of GSC is one of the most signiﬁcant developments in the
past decade, offering the opportunity for companies to align their
supply chains in accordance with environmental and sustainability
goals.
The most common GSCM practices involve organizations
assessing the environmental performance of their suppliers,
requiring suppliers to undertake measures that ensure environmental quality of their products, and evaluating the cost of waste
in their operating systems (Handﬁeld, Walton, Sroufe, & Melnyk,
2002). A high level of environmental performance achieved by a
ﬁrm may be broken down by a poor level of environmental management by its suppliers. Therefore, green suppliers and their
selection, evaluation, etc. processes are vital in a green supply
chain.

The past few years have led researchers to investigate the environmental concepts in management and supply chains. Lu, Wu,
and Kuo (2007) proposed environmental principles applicable to
green supplier evaluation by using multi-objective decision analysis. According to current environmental regulations, companies’
environmental policies, and nongovernmental organizations’ environmental guidelines; the main environmental criteria were determined as materials, energy use, solid residue, liquid residue,
gaseous residue. And this framework was evaluated using a fuzzy
AHP methodology. Ozgen, Önüt, Gülsün, Tuzkaya, and Tuzkaya
(2008) presented a two-phase possibilistic linear programming
methodology for multi-objective supplier evaluation and order
allocation problems. The required dimensions for evaluating suppliers were indicated as delivery reliability, ﬂexibility and responsiveness, cost, assets and environmental responsiveness. Tuzkaya,
Ozgen, Ozgen, and Tuzkaya (2009) evaluated the environmental
performance of suppliers with a hybrid fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach: fuzzy ANP and Fuzzy Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluations (PROMETHEE)
methodology. In their study, evaluation criteria are determined
as pollution control, green process management, environmental
and legislative management, environmental costs, green product,
and green image. Gumus (2009) introduced evaluation of hazardous waste transportation ﬁrms by using a two step fuzzy-AHP
and TOPSIS methodology. The determined criteria were hygiene
and safety, quality of service, complementary service, economic
factors, service time, taking care of the human health and environmental protection standards, problem solving ability, and the
owned vehicle ﬂeet. Lee et al. (2009) presented a green supplier
selection model for high-tech industry. The required dimensions
for evaluating green suppliers were indicated as quality, technology capability, pollution control, environment management, green
product, and green competencies/green image.
Recently, Bai and Sarkis (2010) proposed a study for green supplier development and performed an analytical evaluation using
rough set theory. The methodology generates decision rules relating the various attributes to the performance outcomes (environmental, business, and joint performance). Kuo, Wang, and Tien
(2010) integrated artiﬁcial neural network (ANN) and two multiattribute decision analysis (MADA) methods: DEA and ANP for
green supplier selection. Their green supplier selection structure
contains quality, cost, delivery, service, environment, and corporate social responsibility. Punniyamoorthy, Mathiyalagan, and Parthiban (2011) introduced a strategic model using structural
equation modeling and fuzzy logic in supplier selection. Their criteria of supplier selection are management and organization, quality, technical capability, production facilities and capacities,
ﬁnancial position, delivery, services, relationships, safety and environmental concern, and cost. Awasthi, Chauhan, and Goyal (2010)
proposed a fuzzy multi-criteria approach for evaluating environmental performance of suppliers. They used fuzzy TOPSIS for evaluation and their criteria were usage of environment friendly
technology, environment friendly materials, green market share,
partnership with green organizations, management commitment
to green practices, adherence to environmental policies, involvement in green projects, staff training, lean process planning, design
for environment, environmental certiﬁcation, and pollution control
initiatives.

3. Proposed green supplier evaluation framework
This study proposes a novel hybrid analytic approach based on
the fuzzy DEMATEL, fuzzy ANP, and fuzzy TOPSIS methodologies to
assist in GSCM strategic decisions. The general view of the proposed green supplier evaluation methodology is shown in Fig. 1.

Based on these steps, we ﬁrstly mention about the proposed techniques, and then we identify the green supplier evaluation criteria
and present the proposed evaluation model in the following sub
sections.

3.1. Proposed methodologies for the green supplier evaluation
framework
3.1.1. Fuzzy DEMATEL
The DEMATEL method, originated from the Geneva Research
Centre of the Battelle Memorial Institute (Gabus & Fontela,
1973), is especially pragmatic to visualize the structure of complicated causal relationships. DEMATEL is a comprehensive method
for building and analyzing a structural model involving causal
relationships between complex factors. It can clearly see the causeeffect relationship of criteria when measuring a problem (Chen-Yi,
Ke-Ting, & Gwo-Hshiung, 2007). It portrays a basic concept of contextual relation among the elements of the system (which is not a

part of this study because of its integrated methodology), in which
the numeral represents the strength of inﬂuence.
Although DEMATEL is a good technique for evaluating problems, the relationships of systems are generally given by crisp values in establishing a structural model. However, in this real world,
crisp values are inadequate. Many evaluation criteria are surely
imperfect and probably uncertain factors. Thus, fuzzy theory
(Zadeh, 1965) is applied to the DEMATEL method for solving such
a MCDM problem. Fuzzy DEMATEL method is used as many
researchers in the literature (Chang, Chang, & Wu, 2011; Chen
et al., 2008; Lin & Wu, 2008; Liou, Yen, & Tzeng, 2008; Tseng,
2009b; Wu & Lee, 2007), considering the fact that human judgment
about preferences are often unclear and hard to estimate by exact
numerical values.

3.1.2. Fuzzy ANP
ANP is a general form of the analytical hierarchy process (AHP)
ﬁrst introduced by Saaty (1996). While the AHP employs a

unidirectional hierarchical relationship among decision levels, the
ANP enables interrelationships among the decision levels and attributes in a more general form. Instead of a hierarchy, the ANP-based
system is a network that replaces single direction relationships with
dependence and feedback (Saaty, 1996). The ANP uses ratio scale
measurements based on pair wise comparisons; however, it does
not impose a strict hierarchical structure as in AHP, and models a
decision problem using a systems-with-feedback approach. The
ANP refers then to the systems of which a level may both dominate
and be dominated, directly or indirectly, by other decision attributes
and levels. Fig. 2 depicts the structure difference of a hierarchy and a
network.
The ANP approach is capable of handling interdependence
among elements by obtaining the composite weights through the
development of a ‘‘supermatrix’’. A node represents a component
(or cluster) with elements inside it; a straight line/or an arc denotes the interactions between two components; and a loop indicates the inner dependence of elements within a component. For
instance, when the elements of a component ‘‘Goal’’ depend on another component ‘‘Criteria’’, we represent this relation with an arrow from component ‘‘Goal’’ to ‘‘Criteria’’. The supermatrix
development is deﬁned in the next sub-section.
As indicated that human judgment about preferences are often
unclear and hard to estimate by exact numerical values, again fuzzy logic is necessary for handling problems characterized by
vagueness and imprecision. Therefore human judgments, which
are unclear, simultaneously address the issue of combining both
fuzzy set theory and ANP for green supplier assessment. In the literature many researchers such as Tuzkaya and Önüt (2008), Mohanty, Agarwal, Choudhury, and Tiwari (2005), Liu and Lai (2009),
Dag˘deviren and Yüksel (2010), Luo, Zhou, Zheng, Mo, and He
(2010), Liu and Wang (2010), Vinodh, Ramiya, and Gautham
(2011) applied fuzzy ANP to several research ﬁelds.
3.1.3. Fuzzy TOPSIS
TOPSIS is a multiple criteria method to identify solutions from a
ﬁnite set of alternatives and initially proposed by Chen and Hwang
(1992). The underlying logic of TOPSIS proposed by Hwang and
Yoon (1981) is to deﬁne the ideal solution and negative ideal solution. The optimal solution should have the shortest distance from
the positive ideal solution and the farthest from the negative ideal
solution. If to remind, human judgments are usually rely on imprecision, subjectivity and vagueness; so they address fuzzy logic.
Here evaluations expressed by linguistic terms and then set into
fuzzy numbers.
Fuzzy TOPSIS methodology requires preliminarily information
about the relative importance of the criteria. This importance is
expressed by attributing a weight to each considered criterion wj.
The weight of each criterion is evaluated by fuzzy DEMATEL and

fuzzy ANP steps as mentioned. There are various fuzzy TOPSIS
studies in various areas as clean agent selection (Aiello, 2009),
ﬁrms’ competence evaluation (Amiri, Zandieh, Soltani, & Vahdani,
2009), assessing thermal-energy storage in concentrated solar
power (CSP) systems (Cavallaro, 2010), development of a quick
credibility scoring decision support system (Iç & Yurdakul, 2010),
personnel selection (Kelemenis & Askounis, 2010), supplier selection (Roghanian, Rahimi, & Ansari, 2010), assessment of trafﬁc
police centers performance (Sadi-Nezhad & Damghani, 2010), evaluating the competitive advantages of shopping websites (Sun and
Lin; 2009), virtual enterprise partner selection (Ye, 2010), etc.
In the literature, there are some realized studies that combine
ANP, TOPSIS and DEMATEL methodologies. Chen and Chen (2010)
presented an innovation support system for Taiwanese higher education using a novel conjunctive MCDM approach based on DEMATEL, fuzzy ANP, and TOPSIS. Lin, Hsieh, and Tzeng (2010) evaluated
vehicle telematics system by using DEMATEL, ANP, and TOPSIS
techniques with dependence and feedback. However, although
these kinds of combined works have increased in the recent years,
there is not any study combines DEMATEL, ANP, and TOPSIS in fuzzy environment.
3.2. Criteria of green supplier evaluation framework
A detailed literature search with the concepts related to GSC is
realized. We can ﬁnd some concepts and elements which can be
served as the foundation for a decision framework for prioritizing
or selecting systems by the organization that would aid in selecting
green suppliers. These are summarized as follows:
Green logistics dimension: A more tactical set of organizational
elements that will inﬂuence how the supply chain is to be managed,
either internally or externally, can be described by green logistics
dimension of an organization. Major elements of the green logistics
dimension will typically include procurement, production, distribution, reverse logistics and packaging (Awasthi et al., 2010; Lee et al.,
2009; Punniyamoorthy et al., 2011; Rao & Holt, 2005; Sarkis, 2003;
Sarkis, Meade, & Talluri, 2004; Tuzkaya et al., 2009; Zhu, Sarkis, &
Lai, 2007; Zhu, Sarkis, & Lai, 2008). It is estimated that 80% of all
product related environmental impacts are determined in the
design phase, so integrating environmental considerations early in
the product design development cycle is the most effective way of
reducing their impact and the major elements of the design stage
are the selection of the materials and production design (Goosey,
2004). In an environmental friendly chain the ﬁrst step is procurement and vendor selection. Production inﬂuences the green supply
chain with the design and the production process. Within this function, environmental issues such as closed-loop manufacturing, total
quality environmental management, de-manufacturing and source
reduction make some form of value-adding contribution, even

though some of them also inﬂuence other functional areas (Sarkis
et al., 2004). For instance a well designed product should avoid the
need for using hazardous or restricted materials during the manufacturing process and should minimize waste during the manufacturing process (Jabbour & Jabbour, 2009; Kubokawa & Saito, 2000;
Kurk & Eagan, 2008). Distribution is another operation that effect
green supply chain. The carrier, the capacity of the carrier, the type
of fuel that the carrier uses, the frequency of transportation and
the distance to the customers are some items that affect the performance of the green distribution. A signiﬁcant trend in GSCM has
been the recognition of the strategic importance of reverse logistics.
The deﬁnition of reverse logistics from an environmental perspective focuses primarily on the return of recyclable or reusable products and materials into the forward supply chain. Designing
effective and efﬁcient RL networks is a key driver for providing the
economic beneﬁts necessary to initiate and sustain GSCM initiatives
on a large scale (Srivastava, 2007). Packaging characteristics such as
size, shape and materials have an impact on distribution due to their
affect on the transport characteristics of the products. Better packaging, along with rearranged loading patterns can reduce material
usage, increase space utilization in warehouses and in trucks, and reduce the amount of handling. Systems that encourage and adopt
returnable packaging will require a strong customer-supplier relationship and an effective reverse logistics channel.
Green organizational activities dimension: The major ﬁve green
organization activities dimensions are reduce, reuse, remanufacture, recycle and disposal (Awasthi et al., 2010; Humphreys, Wong,
& Chan, 2003; Lee et al., 2009; Meade & Sarkis, 2002; Rao & Holt,
2005; Sarkis, 2003; Simpson & Power, 2005; Tuzkaya et al.,
2009). Reduction is viewed as an in-process, relatively proactive,
measure that can be taken by organizations. The waste management hierarchy can typically be depicted by an inverted triangle
with reuse at the top which has maximum width, signifying maximum preference to this management option. Reuse is ‘the use of a
product or component part in its same form for the same use without remanufacturing. The reuse of product may be the reuse of the
entire product, for example the selling of second hand cars or computers, or it may be the reuse of components of a product, for
spares for example. Remanufacturing product involves bringing
used products up to quality standards which are as rigorous as
those for new products. Recycling is the process by which products
otherwise destined for disposal are processed to recover base
materials, for example, precious metals from computer chips. For
minimization of environmental impact the ideal scenario would
be maximum possible reuse and disposal in a landﬁll only when
it cannot be reused or recycled. As recycling is preferred over disposal in a landﬁll for the objectives of minimization of environmental impact and perceived risk, recycling of the waste would
be preferred even after it is no longer economically attractive than
disposal. This would mean a delay in shift from recycling stage of
hierarchy to disposal, as compared to the scenario of priority to
minimization of cost. However, when the objective shifts to minimization of cost, reuse will be preferred only if it is economically
more attractive than recycle and recycling would be continued
only if it is economically more attractive than disposal in a landﬁll.
Organizational performance dimension: There are four widely
accepted manufacturing performance indicators: cost, quality,
delivery and ﬂexibility (Jabbour & Jabbour, 2009; Kuo et al.,
2010; Lee et al., 2009; Tuzkaya et al., 2009; Punniyamoorthy
et al. (2011). These generic strategic performance requirements,
which may not be environmentally based, are necessary to help
identify how well various alternatives can perform on these factors. They are necessary because the alternative that is selected
should not only best support the green supply chain, but also
makes sense from a business perspective. The use of these organizational performance measures have been supported by a number

of strategic thinkers (Handﬁeld & Nichols, 2002; Ketchen & Hult,
2007; Vachon & Klassen, 2006). One characteristic of these performance measures is that they are not static. They tend to change
over time and will be greatly inﬂuenced by the product life cycle.
That is, in the introduction phases, ﬂexibility and time may be
more important than cost. Whereas cost efﬁciencies tend to gain
importance in more mature environments. These dynamical characteristics are incorporated into the decision framework.
Green supplier evaluation criteria: The major ﬁve evaluation criteria for green suppliers are organization, ﬁnancial performance,
service quality, technology, and green competencies (Awasthi
et al., 2010; Bai & Sarkis, 2010; Humphreys et al., 2003; Kou
et al., 2010; Lee et al., 2009; Punniyamoorthy et al., 2011; Rao &
Holt, 2005; Vachon & Klassen, 2006; Walker, Sisto, & McBain,
2008). Organization factor shows the supplier’s degree of compatibility to the GSC. Here business structure, degree of cooperation
relationship closeness and attitudes are the critical factors for the
supplier to be appropriate to GSC. The compatible organization cultures and degree of ﬁtness are some of the desired attributes.
Financial performance shows the performance and control of the
supplier economically. Financial position, economical stability
and price/cost can take part in ﬁnancial performance. There is no
doubt that ﬁnancial position of the supplier and the stability of
the ﬁnance is fundamental for the continuity of the supplier ﬁrms.
Service quality contains the factors that can improve the quality of
suppliers so GSC. The quality certiﬁcates that the supplier has as
ISO 9000, etc., information quality, capability of on time delivery
and on time response to request are the important factors for qualiﬁed suppliers. With these factors, they can improve their quality,
responsiveness and efﬁciency which are essential for a supplier’s
continuity. Technology is the factor that can facilitate innovations
and ﬂexibility to the supplier and SSC. Capacity, R&D capability,
and capability to manage environmental technologies, reverse
ﬂows, etc. are the contents of the technology factor. By this way,
suppliers can be more innovative, ﬂexible and environmentally
friendly. Lastly, green competencies show the competencies of
supplier in improving GSC management. It contains social responsibility, cleaner/environmental production and technologies environmental management system. The supplier organization should
also be capable of environmental management competencies and
environmental image.
Green supplier alternatives: Some green supplier alternatives are
identiﬁed for improving the environmental performance of the
supply chains of the organizations. Fig. 3 presents the network
structure of this evaluation framework.

17.5% market share, behind General Motors (24.6%) but ahead of
Toyota (15.4%) and Daimler Chrysler (14.4%). In the 2007 Fortune
500 list, Ford was the seventh-ranked American-based company
according to global revenues ($160.1 Billion). In 2006, Ford produced approximately 6.6 million automobiles, and employed about
280,000 employees at 100 plants and facilities worldwide (http://
www.ford.com).
Otosan started production in 1965 and since then has occupied
a major role in the development of Turkish automotive industry. In
1997, Ford Motor Company and Koç Holding signed an agreement
and created Ford Otosan as a joint venture. Each company holds
41% share in the venture. Today, Ford Otosan’s capital is 500 Million TL. Ford Otosan has three facilities in Turkey and is employing
8008 people. In 2006, Ford Otosan sold 113.857 vehicles just in
Turkey and has been the market leader last 5 years. In 2006, Ford
Otosan was the market leader with a 17.1% market share (http://
www.ford.com.tr). Ford Otosan’s plant, located in Kocaeli, is named
as ‘‘Best Plant in the World’’ having the best scores in 2002, 2003,
2004 and 2005 among European Ford Plants.
Today, Ford Otosan is one of the biggest and most technologically advanced automotive plants in the world and green practices
are implemented at all stages of the manufacturing process. For
these reasons Ford Otosan is selected as a case company in this
study to evaluate green supply chain management initiatives.
Decision makers were Vedat Okyar (Senior Purchasing ManagerTrim Parts in Gölcük Plant) and Serdar Aydın (New Project Chief
in Gölcük Plant). There were ﬁve possible green suppliers that
are thought they have speciﬁc green competencies.
4.2. The computational steps of the proposed integrated framework
Step 1: Determination of the evaluation model. After setting the
decision goal, construct a committee of experts with E members
and determine the alternatives and sets of criteria for evaluation.
The evaluation criteria have already been discussed in Section 3.2
and the evaluation model can be seen in Fig. 4.
Step 2: Design fuzzy linguistic scale for evaluations. In this step,
development of relationships within and among the attributes
using experts’ opinion through paired comparison analysis is
needed. Firstly, for the purpose of measuring the relationships, it
is required to design the comparison scale as shown in Table 1.
The different degrees of inﬂuence are expressed with eleven linguistic terms and the equivalent fuzzy membership functions for
linguistic values are shown in Fig. 5. Consensus of opinions exists
among experts in the evaluation process.
Step 2: Establish casual relations using the fuzzy DEMATEL.
Step 2.1: Acquire fuzzy direct-relation matrix. Experts make
sets of the pairwise comparisons in terms of inﬂuence and direce in which
tion within necessary criteria that is a n Â n matrix A,

direct-relation matrix for organization performance dimension.
Step 2.2: Acquire normalized fuzzy direct-relation matrix. After
producing the direct-relation matrix as the ﬁrst step, we can continue with normalizing the direct-direction matrix as in DEMATEL

Then the inner dependence matrix can be acquired to put in the unweighted supermatrix of ANP later. Table 5 shows the inner dependence matrix of organizational performance dimension and can be
seen in Fig. 6 as matrix B of the supermatrix.
Step 3: Establish remaining relations using the fuzzy ANP. In
ANP, like AHP, pair wise comparisons of the elements in each level
are conducted with respect to their relative importance towards
their control criterion. By using triangular fuzzy numbers again,
the relative strength of each pair of elements and the preferences
of the decision maker in the same hierarchy are indicated. Via

control the result of the method, the consistency ratio for each of
the matrices and the overall inconsistency for the hierarchy are calculated. The Consistency Ratio (CR) is used to directly estimate the
consistency of the pair-wise comparisons and should be less than
0.10. Then it can be said the comparisons are acceptable, otherwise
they are not acceptable. In this study, the inconsistency ratios for all
the comparison matrices were calculated for the mean values of the
fuzzy numbers. Because the lower and upper values provide ﬂexibility for human judgments, they are not expected to have rigid
consistency.

Step 3.2: Defuzzify the weights obtained from fuzzy matrices. In
this step, defuzziﬁcation of the weights is done in the same way as
Eq. (6).
Such an example, priority calculation of the production – one of
the green logistics dimensions – with respect to goal (from Table 6)
is as follows. By applying Eq. (8), the fuzzy weight is obtained as,

4.1: Solve the supermatrix. To complete this task, ﬁrstly each of
the columns may either be normalized by dividing each weight in
the column by the sum of that column. Then, the ﬁnal step in the
process is to obtain a priority ranking for each of the alternatives.
To derive the overall priorities of elements, the normalized
supermatrix is raised to limiting powers to calculate the overall

Then using this fuzzy vector and applying Eq. (6), defuzziﬁed
weight 0.4046 is obtained.
Step 4: Form a supermatrix. ANP uses the formation of a supermatrix to allow for the resolution of the effects of the interdependence that exists between the clusters within the decision
network hierarchy. The supermatrix is a partitioned matrix, where
each submatrix is composed of a set of relationships between two
clusters in the graphical model. A generic supermatrix is shown
in Fig. 6, with the notation representing the various relationships
from Fig. 4; for instance, ‘‘A’’ is the submatrix representing the inﬂuence relationship between green logistics dimension elements’ and
control factor of the goal of selecting a green supplier.
By entering the priorities found by fuzzy DEMATEL and fuzzy
ANP into the appropriate columns, initial supermatrix can be constructed. Table 7 presents the initial supermatrix of the study.

priorities, and thus the cumulative inﬂuence of each element on
every other element with which it interacts is obtained. In this
case, the supermatrix is raised to the power 25. This weighted
supermatrix is shown in Table 8.
According to this weighted supermatrix, weights of the criteria
on the objective of green supplier selection are shown in the ‘‘Goal’’
column to use in fuzzy TOPSIS steps later.
Step 5: Evaluate the alternatives by using fuzzy TOPSIS steps.
The technique is adapted from Chen (2000) and the steps of the
methodology are as follows.
Step 5.1: Establish fuzzy decision matrix for evaluation of the
green supplier alternatives. With m alternatives and n criteria, fuzzy MCDM problem can be expressed as:

Positive and negative distances of the green supplier alternatives
can be seen in Table 11.
Step 5.5: Rank the alternatives. The performance indices are
computed to rank the alternatives. Performance indices are sorted
in a decreasing order. Table 12 shows the ﬁnal ranking and according to this hybrid methodology, the best possible green supplier is
S3 with a score of 0.1767.

e represents the fuzzy decision matrix with alternatives A and criD
teria C, and can be seen with linguistic and fuzzy terms in Table 9.
Step 5.2: Normalize the decision matrix. Normalized fuzzy decie is calculated as:
sion matrix R

e ¼ ½~r ij  Ã ;

~r ij ¼

i ¼ 1; 2 . . . ; m;

j ¼ 1; 2 . . . n;

ð9Þ

where C þ
j ¼ maxi C ij .To avoid the complicated normalization formula used in the classical TOPSIS, the linear scale transformation
is used to transform the various criteria scales into a comparable
scale (Chen, 2000). Linear scale transformation for normalization
is also employed by Kuo et al. (2007) and Celik et al. (2009). Here
normalized decision matrix remains the same because max Cij = 1.
Step 5.3: Compute weighted decision matrix. Weighted normalized fuzzy decision matrix that is shown in Table 10 is computed
by using Eq. (11), where wj is the weight for the criterion j obtained
from supermatrix

v~ ij ¼ ~rij  w~ j ;

ð10Þ

~ ij mÃ n ; i ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; m; j ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; n.
where v~ ¼ ½v
Step 5.4: Calculate the distances from positive and negative
ideal points. Since the triangular fuzzy numbers are included in
[0, 1] range, positive and negative ideal reference points (FPIRP,
FNIRP) are as follows:

Aþ ¼ fv~ þ1 ; v~ þ2 ; . . . v~ þn g;

AÀ ¼ fv~ À1 ; v~ À2 ; . . . v~ Àn g;

5. Conclusion
This study suggests a novel hybrid MCDM approach to evaluate
green suppliers for the need of improving GSCM initiatives. Based
on the literature survey and with the validation of industrial experts, possible green supplier evaluation criteria were deﬁned
and a new evaluation model was formulated. The proposed model
was implemented in Ford Otosan, one of the pioneering companies
about environmental subjects in Turkey.
The combined fuzzy ANP and fuzzy DEMATEL approaches used
in this study offered a more precise and accurate analysis by integrating interdependent relationships within and among a set of criteria. Moreover, fuzzy TOPSIS method helped to choose the
alternative for ideal solution of this problem efﬁciently.
While it is believed that the presented model provides value,
there are also further points that can be included. To our knowledge, no previous work investigated such a problem by an integrated method with DEMATEL, ANP, and TOPSIS in fuzzy
environment. As the proposed approach is novel, it might be
applied to other MCDM problems.

The next step is to calculate the distance of alternatives from
FPIRP and FNIRP.
