During recent years, how to determine suitable suppliers in the supply chain has become a key strategic
consideration. However, the nature of supplier selection is a complex multi-criteria problem including
both quantitative and qualitative factors which may be in conﬂict and may also be uncertain. The VIKOR
method was developed to solve multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) problems with conﬂicting and
non-commensurable (different units) criteria, assuming that compromising is acceptable for conﬂict resolution, the decision maker wants a solution that is the closest to the ideal, and the alternatives are evaluated according to all established criteria. In this paper, linguistic values are used to assess the ratings
and weights for these factors. These linguistic ratings can be expressed in trapezoidal or triangular fuzzy
numbers. Then, a hierarchy MCDM model based on fuzzy sets theory and VIKOR method is proposed to
deal with the supplier selection problems in the supply chain system. A numerical example is proposed to
illustrate an application of the proposed model.

1. Introduction
In today’s ﬁerce competitive environment characterized by thin
proﬁt margins, high consumer expectations for quality products
and short lead-times, companies are forced to take the advantage
of any opportunity to optimize their business processes. To reach
this aim, academics and practitioners have come to the same conclusion: for a company to remain competitive, it has to work with
its supply chain partners to improve the chain’s total performance.
Thus, being the main process in the upstream chain and affecting
all areas of an organization, the purchasing function is taking an
increasing importance. Thus supply chain management and the
supplier (vendor) selection process is an issue that received relatively large amount of attention in both academia and industry.
Supplier selection is a fundamental issue of supply chain area
which heavily contributes to the overall supply chain performance.
Particularly for companies who spend a high percentage of their
sales revenue on parts and material supplies, and whose material
costs represent a larger portion of total costs, savings from supplies
are of particular importance. These, strongly urge for a more systematic and transparent approach to purchasing decision making,
especially regarding the area of supplier selection. Selecting the
suppliers signiﬁcantly reduces the purchasing cost and improves
corporate competitiveness, and that is why many experts believe

that the supplier selection is the most important activity of a purchasing department. Supplier selection is the process by which
suppliers are reviewed, evaluated, and chosen to become part of
the company’s supply chain. The overall objective of supplier selection process is to reduce purchase risk, maximize overall value to
the purchaser, and build the closeness and long term relationships
between buyers and suppliers (Chena, Lin, & Huangb, 2006).
Several factors affect a supplier’s performance. Dickson (1966),
Ellram (1990), Roa and Kiser (1980), Stamm and Golhar (1993)
identiﬁed, respectively 60, 18, 13 and 23 criteria for supplier
selection.
The supplier selection process is often in inﬂuenced by uncertainty in practice (de Boer, van der Wegen, & Telgen, 1998; Min,
1994). Due to strategic importance and involvement of various
uncertainties and risks associated with the supplier selection process, several decision makers from departments other than purchasing such as production, ﬁnance, and marketing are very
often involved in the decision making process for supplier selection
process. Therefore, some scholars emphasized the need for a rational and systematic group decision making process for supplier
selection (de Boer et al., 1998). In essential; the supplier selection
problem in supply chain system is a group decision making combination of several and different criteria with different forms of
uncertainty (Chena et al., 2006). Hence this problem is a kind of
multiple criteria decision making problem (MCDM) which requires
MCDM methods for an effective problem-solving. Due to nature of
the problem, the techniques of MCDM are coherently derived to

manage it. de Boer, Labro, and Morlacchi (2001) and Aissaoui,
Haouari, and Hassini (2007) gave a good review and classiﬁcation
of the methods for supporting supplier selection. We can roughly
divide these methods into six main categories: multi-attribute
decision making (MADM), multi-objective decision making and
mathematical programming (MP), statistics/probabilistic approaches, intelligent approaches, hybrid approaches and others.
Six categories, each with their own related approaches and examples, are listed in Table 1.
Methods of the ﬁrst category concentrate on selection activities.
They select a limited and countable number of predetermined
alternatives through multiple attributes or criteria. These methods
involves multi attribute utility theory (MAUT), outranking methods, analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and its sophisticated version, analytical network process (ANP) and technique for order
performance by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS). Among these
methods, it is difﬁcult to obtain a mathematical representation of
the decision maker’s utility function for using MAUT (Opricovic &
Tzeng, 2007). The outranking methods are normally not used for
the actual selection of alternatives, but they are very suitable for
the initial screening process (to categorize alternatives into acceptable or unacceptable). After the screening process another method
must be used to get a full ranking or actual recommendations
among the alternatives (Loken, 2007). Also AHP and ANP have their
own problems: rank reversal and difﬁculty in accommodating a
great many candidates. The other method in this category, TOPSIS,
is discussed in Section 2.
The methods in the second category optimize the interactions
and tradeoffs among different factors of interest by considering
constraints and different issues like discount, single or multiple
sourcing and logistic costs; which allow the buyer to make an
effective decision usually by determining the best order quantity/
period from the suitable supplier/suppliers. Several optimization
methods such as goal programming, linear programming, mixed
integer and data envelopment analysis have been applied in this
area. A signiﬁcant problem with using mathematical programming
methods is that most of them are too complex for practical use by
operating managers. The other fallback of these methods is their

25

lack to consider qualitative factors. Furthermore the methods in
this category are mainly used in multiple sourcing environments
for assigning order quantities between supplier/suppliers.
Statistical studies incorporate uncertainty; there are not many
articles in the literature that utilize statistics in the supplier selection process. The published statistical models only accommodate
for uncertainty with regard to one criterion at a time (de Boer
et al., 2001).
Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) based models are based on computeraided systems that in one way or another can be trained by a purchasing expert or historic data, however, the complexity of the system is not suitable for enterprises to solve the issue efﬁciently
without high capability in advanced computer programs.
The ﬁfth category is hybrid and innovative methods which
authors integrate one or more methods together to utilize their
both advantages. However the disadvantages of combined methods affect the effectiveness of hybrid models.
In other way the VIKOR method, a recently introduced new
MCDM method developed to solve multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) problems with conﬂicting and non-commensurable
(different units) criteria (Opricovic & Tzeng, 2007), may provide
the basis for developing supplier selection models that can effectively deal with characteristics of this problem. In this paper, we
used the concept of fuzzy set theory and linguistic values to overcome uncertainty and qualitative factors. Then, a hierarchy MCDM
model based on fuzzy sets theory and VIKOR method is proposed
to deal with the supplier selection problems in the supply chain
system.
The rest of this paper is structured as follows. In the next section, an overview and background of the VIKOR method is presented. In Section 3, an overview of the concepts of the fuzzy
approach is given. Section 4 will focus on the proposed model.
Then a numerical example is illustrated in Section 5. In the ﬁnal
section, some conclusions are drawn for the study.
2. VIKOR method
Opricovic (1998), Opricovic and Tzeng (2002) developed VIKOR,
the Serbian name: VlseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno
Resenje, means multi-criteria optimization and compromise solution (Chu, Shyu, Tzeng, & Khosla, 2007). The VIKOR method was
developed for multi-criteria optimization of complex systems
(Opricovic & Tzeng, 2004). This method focuses on ranking and
selecting from a set of alternatives, and determines compromise
solutions for a problem with conﬂicting criteria, which can help
the decision makers to reach a ﬁnal decision. Here, the compromise
solution is a feasible solution which is the closest to the ideal, and a
compromise means an agreement established by mutual concessions (Opricovic & Tzeng, 2007). It introduces the multi-criteria
ranking index based on the particular measure of ‘‘closeness” to
the ‘‘ideal” solution (Opricovic, 1998).
According to (Opricovic & Tzeng, 2004) the multi-criteria measure for compromise ranking is developed from the PLp -metric
used as an aggregating function in a compromise programming
method (Yu, 1973). The various J alternatives are denoted as
a1 ; a2 ; . . . ; aJ . For alternative aj , the rating of the i th aspect is denoted by fij , i.e. fij is the value of i th criterion function for the alternative aj ; n is the number of criteria. Development of the VIKOR
method started with the following form of Lp -metric:

½wi ðfi À fij Þ=ðfi À fi Þ
;

1 6 p 6 1;

ð1Þ

j ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; J:

Within the VIKOR method L1;j (as Sj in Eq. (15)) and L1;j (as Rj in Eq.
(16)) are used to formulate ranking measure. L1;j is interpreted as

26

A. Sanayei et al. / Expert Systems with Applications 37 (2010) 24–30

‘concordance’ and can provide decision makers with information
about the maximum group utility’ or ‘majority’. Similarly, L1;j is
interpreted as ‘discordance’ and provides decision makers with
information about the minimum individual regret of the ‘opponent’.
Also TOPSIS, another MCDM method, is based on aggregating
function representing ‘‘closeness to ideal”. In TOPSIS the chosen
alternative should have the ‘‘shortest distance” from the ideal solution and the ‘‘farthest distance” from the ‘‘negative-ideal”. The
TOPSIS method introduces two reference points, but it does not
consider the relative importance of the distances from these
points. These two MCDM methods use different kinds of normalization to eliminate the units of the criterion functions, whereas
the VIKOR method uses linear normalization, the TOPSIS method
uses vector normalization. The normalized value in the VIKOR
method does not depend on the evaluation unit of criterion function, whereas the normalized values by vector normalization in
the TOPSIS method may depend on the evaluation unit (Chu
et al., 2007).

3. Fuzzy approach
In dealing with a decision process, the decision maker is often
faced with doubts, problems and uncertainties. In other words natural language to express perception or judgment is always subjective, uncertain or vague. To resolve the vagueness, ambiguity and
subjectivity of human judgment, fuzzy sets theory (Zadeh, 1965)
was introduced to express the linguistic terms in decision making
(DM) process. Bellman and Zadeh (1970) developed fuzzy multicriteria decision making (FMCDM) methodology to resolve the lack
of precision in assigning importance weights of criteria and the ratings of alternatives regarding evaluation criteria.
The logical tools that people can rely on are generally considered the outcome of a bivalent logic (yes/no, true/false), but the
problems posed by real-life situations and human thought processes and approaches to problem-solving are by no means bivalent (Tong & Bonissone, 1980). Just as conventional, bivalent
logic is based on classic sets, fuzzy logic is based on fuzzy sets. A
fuzzy set is a set of objects in which there is no clear-cut or predeﬁned boundary between the objects that are or are not members of
the set. The key concept behind this deﬁnition is that of ‘‘membership”: any object may be a member of a set ‘‘to some degree”; and a
logical proposition may hold true”to some degree”. Each element
in a set is associated with a value indicating to what degree the element is a member of the set. This value comes within the range
[0, 1], where 0 and 1, respectively, indicate the minimum and maximum degree of membership, while all the intermediate values
indicate degrees of ‘‘partial” membership (Bevilacqua, Ciarapica,
& Giacchetta, 2006).
This approach helps decision makers solve complex decision
making problems in a systematic, consistent and productive way
(Carlsson & Fuller, 1996) and has been widely applied to tackle
DM problems with multiple criteria and alternatives (Wang &
Chang, 2007). In short, fuzzy set theory offers a mathematically
precise way of modeling vague preferences for example when it
comes to setting weights of performance scores on criteria. Simply
stated, fuzzy set theory makes it possible to mathematically describe a statement like: ‘‘criterion X should have a weight of
around 0.8” (de Boer et al., 2001).
Fuzzy set theory was also looked at as a tool for supplier selection because of the vagueness of the information related to parameters. Narasimhan (1983), Nydick and Hill (1992) handled
imprecise information and uncertainty in supplier selection models for ﬁnding the best overall rating supplier. Amid, Ghodsypour,
and O’Brien (2006) developed a fuzzy multi-objective linear model
to overcome the vagueness of the information. Chena et al. (2006)

developed a model that combines the use of fuzzy set theory and
TOPSIS.
In the following, for the purpose of reference, some important
deﬁnitions and notations of fuzzy sets theory from (Kaufmann &
Gupta, 1991; Dubois & Prade, 1980; Zadeh, 1975; Chena et al.,
2006) will be reviewed.
Let X be the universe of discourse, X ¼ fx1 ; x2 ; . . . ; xn g. A fuzzy

The height of a fuzzy set is the largest membership grade ate in the universe
tained by any element in that set. A fuzzy set A

to 1. A fuzzy number is a fuzzy subset in the universe of discourse
X that is both convex and normal.
Fuzzy membership function has more types. This paper adopts
the type of a trapezoidal fuzzy number. A positive trapezoidal fuzzy number (PTFN)c can be deﬁned as ða1 ; a2 ; a3 ; a4 Þ, shown in Fig. 1.
The membership function leðxÞ is deﬁned as:

4. Proposed method for supplier selection
A systematic approach to extend the VIKOR is proposed to solve
the supplier selection problem under a fuzzy environment in this
section. In this paper the importance weights of various criteria
and the ratings of qualitative criteria are considered as linguistic
variables. Because linguistic assessments merely approximate the
subjective judgment of decision makers, we can consider linear
trapezoidal membership functions to be adequate for capturing
the vagueness of these linguistic assessments.
In fact, supplier selection in supply chain system is a group multiple criteria decision making (GMCDM) problem, which may be
described by means of the following sets (Chena et al., 2006):
1. a set of K decision makers called E ¼ fD1 ; D2 ; . . . ; DK g;
2. a set of m possible suppliers called A ¼ fA1 ; A2 ; . . . ; Am g;
3. a set of n criteria, C ¼ fC 1 ; C 2 ; . . . ; C n g, with which supplier performances are measured;
4. a set of performance ratings of Ai ði ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; mÞ with respect to
criteria C j ðj ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; nÞ, called X ¼ fxij ; i ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; m; j ¼
1; 2; . . . ; ng
The main steps of the algorithms are:
4.1. Identify the objectives of the decision making process and deﬁne
the problem scope
Decision making is the process of deﬁning the decision goals,
gathering relevant information and selecting the optimal alternative (Hess & Siciliano, 1996). Thus, the ﬁrst step is deﬁning the
decision goal that here is to evaluate and select a favorable supplier/s. Making precise statement of the problem will help to narrow it. Giving clear and careful thought to this ﬁrst step is very
vital to selecting process. The way in which the process is deﬁned
will deterministic the character of all the other steps.
In this step, the scope of the problem is deﬁned in terms of the
product/service to be outsourced, time frame for outsourcing, justiﬁcation of decision, constraints in the supplier selection process,
available alternative sources to choose from etc. Then the objectives of supplier selection is derived from various areas of organization impacted by the decision, e.g. assembly line, supplier
quality assurance department, ﬁnance group, logistics department
etc. and aligning them with the overall organizational goals.
4.2. Arrange the decision making group and deﬁne and describe a ﬁnite
set of relevant attributes
As mentioned previously, in supplier evaluation and selection
process several people and experts from different functional areas
within the company are involved. So with considering the problem
scope deﬁned in previous section and its entire dimension, we
must form a group of decision makers.

Fig. 2. Linguistic variables for importance weight of each criteria.

Supplier selection ﬁrst requires identiﬁcation of decision attributes (criteria) then evaluation scales/metrics are determined in
order to measure appositeness of supplier. These criteria must be
deﬁned according to the corporate strategies, company’s competitive situation, the level of buyer–supplier integration (Ghodsypour
& O’Brien, 1998) and type of product which be outsourced. Then
with considering sub-criteria for each main criterion, hierarchical
form called ‘‘value tree” is structured.
4.3. Identify the appropriate linguistic variables
In this step we must deﬁne the appropriate linguistic variables
for the importance weight of criteria, and the fuzzy rating for alternatives with regard to each criterion these linguistic variables can
be expressed in positive trapezoidal fuzzy numbers, as in Figs. 1
and 2. It is suggested in this paper that the decision makers use
the linguistic variables shown in Figs. 1 and 2 to evaluate the
importance of the criteria and the ratings of alternatives with respect to qualitative criteria. For example, the linguistic variable
‘‘Medium High (MH)” can be represented as (0.5; 0.6; 0.7; 0.8), the
membership function of which is:

4.4. Pull the decision makers’ opinions to get the aggregated fuzzy
weight of criteria, and aggregated fuzzy rating of alternatives and
construct a fuzzy decision matrix

fuzzy ratings ð~

can be calculated as:

C2. Acceptable stability in decision making:
The alternative Að1Þ must also be the best ranked by S or/and R.
This compromise solution is stable within a decision making process, which could be the strategy of maximum group utility (when
v > 0:5 is needed), or ‘‘by consensus”v % 0:5, or ‘‘with veto”
ðv < 0:5Þ. Here, v is the weight of decision making strategy of maximum group utility.
If one of the conditions is not satisﬁed, then a set of compromise
solutions is proposed, which consists of
 Alternatives Að1Þ and Að2Þ if only the condition C2 is not satisﬁed,
or
 Alternatives Að1Þ ; Að2Þ ; . . . ; AðMÞ if the condition C1 is not satisﬁed;
AðMÞ is determined by the relation Q ðAðMÞ Þ À Q ðAð1Þ Þ < DQ for
maximum M (the positions of these alternatives are ‘‘in
closeness”).
5. Numerical example
The proposed model has been applied to a supplier selection
process of a ﬁrm working in the ﬁeld of automobile part manufacturing in the following steps:

4.5. Defuzzify the fuzzy decision matrix and fuzzy weight of each
criterion into crisp values

Step 1: The Company desires to select a suitable supplier
to purchase the key components of its new product. After preliminary screening, ﬁve candidate
suppliers (S1, S2, S3, S4, and S5) remain for further
evaluation.
Step 2: A committee of three decision makers, D1; D2 and
D3, has been formed to select the most suitable
supplier. The following criteria have been deﬁned:
 Product quality
 On-time delivery
 Price/cost
 Supplier’s technological level
 Flexibility

Deffuzzify fuzzy decision matrix and fuzzy weight of each criterion into crisp values using COA defuzziﬁcation relation proposed
in Section 3 (Relation 9).

Step 3: Three decision makers use the linguistic weighting
variables shown in Fig. 2 to assess the importance
of the criteria. The importance weights of the criteria determined by these three decision makers are
shown in Table 2. Also the decision makers use the
linguistic rating variables shown in Fig. 3 to evaluate the ratings of candidates with respect to each
criterion. The ratings of the ﬁve suppliers by the

6. Conclusion
Many practitioners and academics have emphasized the advantages of supply chain management. In order to increase the competitive advantage, many companies consider that a welldesigned and implemented supply chain system is an important
tool. Therefore being the main process in the upstream chain and
affecting all areas of an organization, the supplier selection problem becomes the most important issue to implement a successful
supply chain system.
The supplier selection problem is often inﬂuenced by uncertainty in practice, and in such situation fuzzy set theory is an
appropriate tool to deal with this kind of problems. In real decision
making process, the decision maker is unable (or unwilling) to express his preferences precisely in numerical values and the evaluations are very often expressed in linguistic terms. In this paper an
extension of the VIKOR, a recently introduced MCDM method, in

Step 5: The crisp values for decision matrix and weight of
each criterion are computed as shown in Table 6.
Step 6: The best and the worst values of all criterion ratings are determined as follows:
f1Ã ¼ 0:87; f2Ã ¼ 0:92; f3Ã ¼ 0:80; f4Ã ¼ 0:92; f5Ã ¼ 0:85;
f1À ¼ 0:65; f2À ¼ 0:72; f3À ¼ 0:40; f4À ¼ 0:70; f5À ¼ 0:65:

Steps 7 and 8: The values of S, R and Q are calculated for all suppliers as Table 6.
Step 9: The ranking of the suppliers by S, R and Q in
decreasing order is shown in Table 7.
Step 9: As we see in Table 6, the supplier S3 is the best
ranked by Q. Also the conditions C1 and C2 are

fuzzy environment is proposed to deal with the both qualitative
and quantitative criteria and select the suitable supplier effectively. It appears this method has some advantages which may
be useful in dealing with supplier selection problem.
The proposed method is very ﬂexible. Using this method not
only enables us to determine the outranking order of suppliers,
but also assess and rate the suppliers. These rating can be used
in combination with mathematical programming and other methods to deal with supplier selection in multiple sourcing environments. Also the proposed method for supplier selection in fuzzy
environment provides a systematic approach which can be easily
extend to deal with other management decision making problems.
