Multi-Criteria Decision Aid (MCDA) or Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) methods have received
much attention from researchers and practitioners in evaluating, assessing and ranking alternatives
across diverse industries. Among numerous MCDA/MCDM methods developed to solve real-world decision problems, the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) continues to
work satisfactorily across different application areas. In this paper, we conduct a state-of-the-art literature survey to taxonomize the research on TOPSIS applications and methodologies. The classiﬁcation
scheme for this review contains 266 scholarly papers from 103 journals since the year 2000, separated
into nine application areas: (1) Supply Chain Management and Logistics, (2) Design, Engineering and
Manufacturing Systems, (3) Business and Marketing Management, (4) Health, Safety and Environment
Management, (5) Human Resources Management, (6) Energy Management, (7) Chemical Engineering,
(8) Water Resources Management and (9) Other topics. Scholarly papers in the TOPSIS discipline are further interpreted based on (1) publication year, (2) publication journal, (3) authors’ nationality and (4)
other methods combined or compared with TOPSIS. We end our review paper with recommendations
for future research in TOPSIS decision-making that is both forward-looking and practically oriented. This
paper provides useful insights into the TOPSIS method and suggests a framework for future attempts in
this area for academic researchers and practitioners.

1. Introduction
Multiple-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) or Multiple-criteria
decision making (MCDM) is a sub-discipline and full-grown branch
of operations research that is concerned with designing mathematical and computational tools to support the subjective evaluation
of a ﬁnite number of decision alternatives under a ﬁnite number
of performance criteria by a single decision maker or by a group
(Lootsma, 1999). MCDA/MCDM uses knowledge from many ﬁelds,
including mathematics, behavioral decision theory, economics,
computer technology, software engineering and information systems. Since the 1960s, MCDA/MCDM has been an active research
area and produced many theoretical and applied papers and books
(Roy, 2005). MCDA/MCDM methods have been designed to designate a preferred alternative, classify alternatives in a small number
of categories, and/or rank alternatives in a subjective preference
order. A number of literature review papers, i.e., Behzadian,
Kazemzadeh, Aghdasi, and Albadvi (2010) on PROMETHEE and
Vaidya and Kumar (2006) and Ho (2008) on AHP, show the vitality
of the ﬁeld and the many methods that have been developed.

Among numerous MCDA/MCDM methods developed to solve
real-world decision problems, Technique for Order Preference by
Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) continues to work satisfactorily in diverse application areas. Hwang and Yoon (1981) originally
proposed TOPSIS to help select the best alternative with a ﬁnite
number of criteria. As a well-known classical MCDA/MCDM
method, TOPSIS has received much interest from researchers and
practitioners. The global interest in the TOPSIS method has exponentially grown, which we wish to document in this paper.
This paper provides a state-of the-art literature survey on TOPSIS applications and methodologies. A reference repository has
been established based on a classiﬁcation scheme, which includes
266 papers published in 103 scholarly journals since 2000. Scholarly papers are further categorized into application areas, publication year, journal name, authors’ nationality, and integrating other
MADM/MCDM methods into TOPSIS. Our contributions are threefold: developing a classiﬁcation scheme focused on these practical
considerations, a structured review that provides a guide to earlier
research on the TOPSIS method, and identifying research issues for
future investigation.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides
a brief overview and the implementation steps used in TOPSIS. Section 3 describes the methodology used in the literature review.
Section 4 provides the breakdown of the review, which contains

nine application areas. Section 5 distributes the selected papers
into four further categories. Finally, Section 6 presents concluding
remarks.
2. TOPSIS procedure
TOPSIS, developed by Hwang and Yoon in 1981, is a simple
ranking method in conception and application. The standard TOPSIS method attempts to choose alternatives that simultaneously
have the shortest distance from the positive ideal solution and
the farthest distance from the negative-ideal solution. The positive
ideal solution maximizes the beneﬁt criteria and minimizes the
cost criteria, whereas the negative ideal solution maximizes the
cost criteria and minimizes the beneﬁt criteria. TOPSIS makes full
use of attribute information, provides a cardinal ranking of alternatives, and does not require attribute preferences to be independent
(Chen and Hwang, 1992; Yoon & Hwang, 1995). To apply this technique, attribute values must be numeric, monotonically increasing
or decreasing, and have commensurable units.
Fig. 1 presents the stepwise procedure of Hwang and Yoon (1981)
for implementing TOPSIS. After forming an initial decision matrix,
the procedure starts by normalizing the decision matrix. This is followed by building the weighted normalized decision matrix in Step
2, determining the positive and negative ideal solutions in Step 3,
and calculating the separation measures for each alternative in Step
4. The procedure ends by computing the relative closeness coefﬁcient. The set of alternatives (or candidates) can be ranked according
to the descending order of the closeness coefﬁcient.
3. Framework for literature review
This literature review was undertaken to identify articles in
high-ranking journals that provide the most valuable information
to researchers and practitioners studying live issues concerning
the TOPSIS method. With this scope in mind, we conducted an

extensive search for TOPSIS in the title, abstract, and keywords of
scholarly papers. We particularly targeted library databases: Elsevier, Springer, Taylor and Francis, Emerald, John Wiley, IEEExplore
and EBSCO, covering major journals in operation research and
management sciences. Conference proceeding papers, master’s
theses, doctoral dissertations, textbooks, and unpublished working
papers were thus excluded from the literature review.
The primary data for this review were gathered from almost
400 cited articles in the library databases published since 2000.
As most scholarly papers on TOPSIS have been published since
2000, we choose this year as a starting date for search. An article
is included in the review if it thoroughly discusses the application,
development or modiﬁcation of the TOPSIS method or a performance comparison of TOPSIS with other MCDA/MCDM methods.
With this purpose in mind, we narrowed the list to 266 major research papers published in 103 journals. The target papers in this
review were analyzed, classiﬁed, coded, and recorded under a classiﬁcation scheme, shown in Table 1. As each paper was reviewed, it
was classiﬁed by several categories: publication year, authors’
nationality, journal title, application area, speciﬁc sub-area, if it
combined or compared other MCDA/MCDM techniques, and if
the techniques were applied as a group decision making approach.
Although this review cannot claim to be comprehensive, it covers a
large portion of the leading publications on TOPSIS methodologies
and applications and provides a valuable source for researchers
and practitioners.

4. Application areas
This wide range of real-world applications for the TOPSIS method imposed a strong motivation for categorizing applications
across different ﬁelds and speciﬁc sub-areas. Application research
studies include case studies, illustrative examples, and/or practical
experiences. To show similarities and differences, 266 papers were
categorized into nine areas: (1) Supply Chain Management and

Business and Marketing Management, (4) Health, Safety and Environment Management, (5) Human Resources Management, (6) Energy Management, (7) Chemical Engineering, (8) Water Resources
Management, and (9) Other topics. For those papers that fall into
more than one category, the best possible choice was selected
based on the target audience as deﬁned by the paper’s objective.
This ensures that no duplication existed in our classiﬁcation
scheme. The last area covers papers published in ﬁelds such as
Medicine, Agriculture, Education, Design, Government, and Sports.
Table 2 shows the number of papers and their respective percentages in each application area. The top 2 categories – ‘‘Supply Chain
Management and Logistics’’ and ‘‘Design, Engineering and Manufacturing Systems’’ – contain over 50% of the total published applications. Few applications have been devoted to ‘‘Chemical
Engineering’’ or ‘‘Water Resources Management’’.
The following sections present an extensive review of the 266
scholarly papers classiﬁed into nine application areas and their
speciﬁc sub-areas. First, some papers are brieﬂy mentioned in each
section, and each topic is further summarized by speciﬁc tables
corresponding to their sub-areas. The papers in each table are arranged in alphabetical order by author. The vast majority of application papers have proposed TOPSIS extensions or modiﬁcations,
which are classiﬁed under the ‘‘Other techniques combined or
compared’’ column of each table.
4.1. Supply Chain Management and Logistics
Supply Chain Management and Logistics is considered the most
popular topic in TOPSIS applications. Supply chain and logistics
management covers several speciﬁc sub-areas, including supplier
selection, transportation, and location problem.
For supplier selection, Chen et al. (2006) proposed a fuzzy systematic approach to extend TOPSIS to solve the supplier selection
problem based on supplier proﬁtability, relationship closeness,
technological capability, conformance quality, and conﬂict resolution factors. According to this extended approach, a closeness coefﬁcient was deﬁned to determine the ranking order of all suppliers
by simultaneously calculating the distances to the fuzzy positiveideal and fuzzy negative-ideal solutions. To handle outsourcing
decision-making problems, Kahraman et al. (2009) presented a
fuzzy group decision-making methodology based on TOPSIS. In this
study, the fuzzy TOPSIS approach was used to specify the ranking
of alternatives according to an aggregated decision matrix and
weight vector and was based on the individual decision matrices
and weight vectors. For the location problem, Yong (2006) presented a new TOPSIS approach to select plant locations, where
the ratings of various locations for each criterion and the weights
of various criteria were assessed using fuzzy linguistic terms.
Table 3 summarizes the TOPSIS papers addressed within Supply
Chain Management and Logistics.
4.2. Design, Engineering and Manufacturing Systems
Design, Engineering and Manufacturing Systems issue is a broad
area in the TOPSIS publications. The area typically includes papers

in modern manufacturing systems, automation, material engineering, mechatronics, product design, and quality engineering.
In this area, Lin, Wang, Chen, and Chang (2008c) presented a
framework that integrates AHP and TOPSIS to help designers identify customer requirements and design characteristics and provide
a ﬁnal design solution for competitive benchmarking. By analyzing
organizational management agility, product design, processing
manufacture, partnership formation capability and information
system integration, Wang (2009) proposed a mass customization
manufacturing agility evaluation approach based on the TOPSIS
method. Shih (2008) utilized a group decision-making process for
the robot selection problem using TOPSIS. Table 4 summarizes
the TOPSIS papers in Design, Engineering and Manufacturing Systems.
4.3. Business and Marketing Management
Business and Marketing Management is the third most popular
area in TOPSIS applications. It covers applications that use TOPSIS
for organizational performance, ﬁnancial measurement, investment projects, customer satisfaction, and competitive advantages.
Approximately 12.3% of all papers fall under the business and
marketing management category.
In this area, Aydogan (2011) proposed integrating AHP and fuzzy TOPSIS to evaluate the performance of four aviation ﬁrms using
ﬁve important dimensions: performance risk, quality, effectiveness, efﬁciency, and occupational satisfaction. Peng, Wang, Kou,
and Shi (2011)offered a new two-step approach to evaluate classiﬁcation algorithms for ﬁnancial risk prediction using an empirical
study that was designed to assess various classiﬁcations. Three
ranking methods, TOPSIS, PROMETHEE, and VIKOR, were used as
the top three classiﬁers. Zandi and Tavana (2011b) presented a
structured approach using a hybrid fuzzy group permutation and
a four-phase QFD model to evaluate and rank agile e-CRM frameworks according to their customer orientation in a dynamic manufacturing environment. Table 5 summarizes TOPSIS papers
found under Business and Marketing Management.
4.4. Health, Safety and Environment Management
Health, Safety and Environment Management is a more recent
topic that utilizes the TOPSIS methodology. It covers several

4.5. Human Resources Management

4.7. Chemical Engineering

Most papers in Human Resources Management are related to
evaluating and employing candidates for a professional job. Kelemenis, Ergazakis, and Askounis (2011) proposed a multi-criteria
approach based on fuzzy TOPSIS group decision-making to select
a middle-level manager in a large IT Greek ﬁrm. Boran, Genç, Kurt,
and Akay (2011) employed an intuitionistic fuzzy TOPSIS approach
to select appropriate personnel from candidates when selecting a
sales manager at a manufacturing company. Table 7summarizes
papers in Human Resources Management.

With only 2.6 percent of the total papers, Chemical Engineering
contains a small portion of TOPSIS publications. Papers on this topic are often concerned with evaluating and optimally selecting
chemical ingredients in experimental environments.
Rao and Baral (2011) described a methodology for the evaluation, comparison, ranking and optimum selection of feed stock
for anaerobic digestion using TOPSIS and graphical methods. Sun,
Liang, Shan, Viernstein, and Unger (2011) used TOPSIS to evaluate
the total natural antioxidants and antioxidant activities across
different regions. They concluded that fruits in arid harsh and
high-altitude regions can accumulate higher levels of natural
antioxidants and display stronger antioxidant activities. Table 9
presents a list of TOPSIS publications in Chemical Engineering.

4.6. Energy Management
Most TOPSIS attempts in Energy Management have concentrated
on evaluating and selecting energy generation methods and
technologies as well as energy system performance. Kaya and
Kahraman (2011) proposed a modiﬁed fuzzy TOPSIS methodology
to select the best energy technology according to technical, economic, environmental and social criteria.Yan, Ling, and Dequn
(2011)applied a new GRD–TOPSIS method to investigatetheperformance of coal enterprise energy conservation and pollutant emission reduction.Table 8 summarizes papers in Energy Management.

4.8. Water Resources Management
The TOPSIS papers in Water Resources Management have been
devoted to evaluating and selecting alternative water networks
and water management scenarios. Dai et al.(2010) presented a
combined gray relation analysis and TOPSIS approach for the integrated water resource security evaluation in Beijing city. Afshar,

social aspects. Albayrak and Erensal (2009)combined TOPSIS and
the linear programming technique for multidimensional analysis
of preference (LINMAP) to identify decision making problems in
knowledge transfer. Rahimi, Gandy, and Mogharreban (2007) proposed a modiﬁed TOPSIS approach to implement a web-based medical diagnostic system. They utilized fuzzy logic to describe the
patients’ symptoms. Sadi-Nezhad and Khalili Damghani (2010) presented a TOPSIS approach based on the preference ratio method
combined with an efﬁcient fuzzy distance measurement for a fuzzy
multiple criteria group decision-making problem. The proposed approach was efﬁciently applied to assess trafﬁc police centers. Table
11 summarizes the TOPSIS publications under ‘‘other topics’’.
5. Other classiﬁcation schemes
This section organizes a distribution of TOPSIS publications by
the following attributes: (1) combined or compared with other
methods, (2) publication year, (3) publication journal, and (4)
authors’ nationality.
5.1. Distribution by combined or compared with other methods
The recent trend of TOPSIS papers has shifted towards applying
the combined TOPSIS rather than the stand-alone TOPSIS. These
combinations have made the classical TOPSIS method more representative and workable when handling practical and theoretical
problems. Tools commonly used to extend the TOPSIS method include the fuzzy set approach, group decision-making approach,
AHP, ANP, entropy method, mathematical programming, and genetic algorithm.
The fuzzy set approach seems to be the most commonly used
method in TOPSIS. As the classical TOPSIS method assumes that
alternative ratings and criteria weights are crisp numbers, more
than half of the TOPSIS publications (52.2%) utilized linguistic variables and fuzzy numbers to handle problems with imprecise information. Many TOPSIS publications (76 papers) were related to
group decision making issues, as groups of managers or experts
make most crucial and signiﬁcant decisions in organizations. Decisions made collectively tend to be more effective than decisions
made by an individual. Many authors have also suggested using
the AHP method in combination with TOPSIS to analyze the structure of complicated decision-making problems and determine criteria weights. When the criteria are independent, the AHP method
is a powerful technique. Several studies (13 papers) employed ANP,
the more general form of the AHP, while considering complex
interrelationships among decision levels and criteria.
A hybrid integration of entropy method with TOPSIS to determine criteria weights has achieved satisfactory results in many
TOPSIS publications. Moreover, the TOPSIS approach was combined with multi-objective mathematical programming to identify
the optimal compromise solution from the optimal solution set of
Pareto distribution.
Other publications compared TOPSIS performance to other
MCDA/MCDM methods, including AHP, ELECTRE PROMETHEE,

VIKOR, DEMATEL and SAW. The purpose of the comparative papers
has been to deﬁne the ranking differences between the TOPSIS
methods and other MCDA/MCDM methods. Table 12 shows the
number and percentage distribution of techniques combined or
compared with TOPSIS.
5.2. Distribution by publication year
Table 13 gives valuable information regarding the frequency
distribution by publication year. Since 2010, there was a considerable growth in the number of papers published on TOPSIS. Almost
half (48.9%) of the total number of papers were published since
2010.
5.3. Distribution by journals
Table 14 shows the number and percentage distribution of
scholarly papers by journal publication. Seventy-three of the103
journals have just one paper on TOPSIS. According to Table 14,
Expert Systems With Applications is the most popular avenue, as it
has published 65 papers (24.4%) of the total TOPSIS papers. The
International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology and
the Mathematical and Computer Modeling, which respectively published 17 and 13 papers on TOPSIS, are two other popular journals.
5.4. Distributions by authors’ nationality
Table 15 shows that 31 countries and nationalities participated
in TOPSIS publications. The geographical distribution of the TOPSIS
papers in both numbers and percentages shows that most productive authors are from Taiwan, China, Iran, Turkey, and India. The
value N = 305 in Table 15 stands for the total number of authors
from a particular nationality or country that have published paper(s) in TOPSIS. It also shows that 228 out of 266 published papers

two countries, and one paper has authors from three countries.
Most TOPSIS publications come from Taiwanese authors (i.e.,63 papers or 20.9%). Chinese, Iranian, and Turkish researchers contributed 44, 40, and 38 papers, respectively. Many papers are from
the Asian continent (N = 185), compared to Europe (N = 84), North
and South America (N = 29), Australia (N = 6) and Africa (N = 1).
6. Concluding remarks
This paper performs a state-of the-art literature review to classify and interpret the ongoing and emerging issues that apply the
TOPSIS methodology. The review categorized 266 scholarly papers
from 103 journals since the year 2000 into nine application areas.
They are further classiﬁed by publication year, publication journal,
authors’ nationality, and other methods combined or compared
with TOPSIS. Overall, we ﬁnd that though the TOPSIS methodology
has been successfully applied to a wide range of application areas
and industrial sectors with varying terms and subjects, it requires
broader emphasis on interdisciplinary and social decision problems.
Future research on TOPSIS anatomy can be extended in several
directions. We can create a window of opportunity to develop the
TOPSIS model, particularly in relation to the distance from the positive and negative solutions and the relative closeness to the ideal
solution. Although several techniques have been combined or integrated with the classical TOPSIS, many other techniques have not
been investigated. These techniques make the classical TOPSIS
more representative and workable in handling practical and theoretical problems. Another future research direction, which could be
an area of theoretical study, is investigating the marked similarities
and differences between TOPSIS and other MCDA/MCDM methods.
The insights identiﬁed in this review will help channel research
efforts and fulﬁll researchers’ and practitioners’ needs for easy
references to TOPSIS publications.

The last author would like to express his gratitude to Universiti
Sains Malaysia for partially supporting this research under the research grant, 1001/pmaths/817060.
