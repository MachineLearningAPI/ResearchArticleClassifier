With respect to multiple attribute group decision-making problems with linguistic information of attribute values and weight values, a group decision analysis is proposed. Some new aggregation operators
are proposed: the extended 2-tuple weighted geometric (ET-WG) and the extended 2-tuple ordered
weighted geometric (ET-OWG) operator and properties of the operators are analyzed. Then, A method
based on the ET-WG and ET-OWG operators for multiple attribute group decision-making is presented.
In the approach, alternative appraisal values are calculated by the aggregation of 2-tuple linguistic information. Thus, the ranking of alternative or selection of the most desirable alternative(s) is obtained by the
comparison of 2-tuple linguistic information. Finally, a numerical example is used to illustrate the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed method.

1. Introduction
Multiple attribute decision-making problems are wide spread in
real-life decision-making situation (Arrow, 1963). A multiple attribute decision making problem is to ﬁnd a desirable solution from a
ﬁnite number of feasible alternatives assessed on multiple attributes, both quantitative and qualitative. In order to choose a desirable solution, decision maker often provide his/her preference
information which takes the form of numerical values, such as exact values, interval number values and fuzzy numbers. However,
under many conditions, numerical values are inadequate or insufﬁcient to model real-life decision problems. Indeed, human judgments including preference information may be stated in
linguistic terms. Thus, multiple attribute decision-making problems under linguistic environment is an interesting research topic
having received more and more attention from researchers during
the last several years. In the process of multiple attribute decisionmaking, the linguistic decision information needs to be aggregated
by means of some proper approaches so as to rank the given decision alternatives and then to select the most desirable one. Several
methods have been proposed for dealing with linguistic information. These methods are mainly as follows:
(1) The method based on extension principle, which makes
operations on the fuzzy numbers that support the semantics
of the linguistic terms (Degani & Bortolan, 1988).

(2) The method based on symbols, which makes computations on the
indexes of the linguistic terms (Delgado, Verdegay, & Vila, 1993).
(3) The method based on 2-tuple linguistic representation
model, which composed by a linguistic term and a real number (Herrera & Martínez, 2000a, 2000b, 2001; Herrera,
Martínez, & Sánchez, 2005). 2-tuple linguistic model has
exact characteristic in linguistic information processing. It
avoided information distortion and losing which occur formerly in the linguistic information processing. In recent
years, 2-tuple linguistic model has been widely used in
group decision making problems (Herrera & Martínez,
2001; Herrera et al., 2005; Herrera-Viedma, Martinez, Mata,
& Chiclana, 2005; Jiang & Fan, 2003a, 2003b; Jiang, Fan, &
Ma, 2008; Kim, Choi, & Kim, 1999; Martínez, 2007; Martínez,
Liu, Ruan, & Yang, 2007; Tang & Zheng, 2006; Wei, 2008;
Wei & Lin, 2008). Herrera and Martínez (2000a) developed
2-tuple arithmetic averaging (TAA) operator, 2-tuple
weighted averaging (TWA) operator, 2-tuple ordered
weighted averaging (TOWA) operator and extended 2-tuple
weighted averaging (ET-WA) operator. Zhang and Fan (2006)
proposed the extended 2-tuple ordered weighted averaging
(ET-OWA) operator. Herrera et al. (2005) presented a group
decision-making process for managing non-homogeneous
information. The non-homogeneous information can be represented as values belonging to domains with different nature as linguistic, numerical and interval valued or can be
values assessed in label sets with different granularity,
multi-granular linguistic information. Herrera-Viedma
et al. (2005) presented a model of consensus support system
to assist the experts in all phases of the consensus reaching

process of group decision-making problems with multigranular linguistic preference relations. Wang and Fan
(2003b) proposed a TOPSIS method for solving multiple
attribute group decision-making problems with linguistic
assessment information. Liao, Li, and Lu (2007) presented a
model for selecting an ERP system based on linguistic information processing. Wei and Lin (2008) developed GRA (grey
relational analysis) method for multiple attribute group
decision-making based on 2-tuple linguistic information.
Wei (2008) utilized the maximizing deviation method to
solve the 2-tuple linguistic multiple attribute group decision
making with incomplete attribute weight information. Jiang
and Fan (2003b) proposed the 2-tuple weighted geometric
(TWG) operator and 2-tuple ordered weighted geometric
(TOWG) operator. Herrera, Herrera-Viedma, and Martínez
(2008) developed a fuzzy linguistic methodology to deal
with unbalanced linguistic term sets. Wang (2009) presented a 2-tuple fuzzy linguistic evaluation model for selecting appropriate agile manufacturing system in relation to
MC production.
In this paper, for the group decision-making problems, in which
both the weights and the attribute preference values take the form
of 2-tuple linguistic information, we have developed some new
geometric aggregation operators: the extended 2-tuple weighted
geometric (ET-WG) and the extended 2-tuple ordered weighted
geometric (ET-OWG) operator and properties of the operators are
analyzed. Then, A method based on the ET-WG and ET-OWG operators for multiple attribute group decision-making is presented.
The remainder of this paper is set out as follows. In the next section, we introduce some basic concepts and operational laws of
2-tuple linguistic variables. In Section 3 we develop some geometric aggregation operators with 2-tuple linguistic assessment
information. In Section 4 we develop a new approach based on
the ET-WG and ET-OWG operators to multiple attribute group
decision-making with 2-tuple linguistic information processing.
In Section 5, we give an illustrative example to verify the developed approach and to demonstrate its feasibility and practicality.
In Section 6 we conclude the paper and give some remarks.

Deﬁnition 2. Let S = {s1, s2, . . . , st} be a linguistic term set and
b 2 [1, t] is a number value representing the aggregation result of
linguistic symbolic. Then the function D used to obtain the 2-tuple
linguistic information equivalent to b is deﬁned as:

D : ½1; t ! S Â ½À0:5; 0:5Þ
&
si ; i ¼ roundðbÞ
DðbÞ ¼
a ¼ b À i; a 2 ½À0:5; 0:5Þ

ð1Þ
ð2Þ

where round (Á) is the usual round operation, si has the closest index
label to b and a is the value of the symbolic translation (Herrera &
Martínez, 2000a, 2000b, 2001; Herrera et al., 2005).
Deﬁnition 3. Let S = {s1, s2, . . . , st} be a linguistic term set and (si, ai)
be a 2-tuple. There is always a function DÀ1 can be deﬁned, such
that, from a 2-tuple (si, ai) it return its equivalent numerical value
b 2 [1, t] & R, which is (Herrera & Martínez, 2000a, 2000b, 2001;
Herrera et al., 2005).

DÀ1 : S Â ½À0:5; 0:5Þ ! ½1; t
À1

D ðsi ; aÞ ¼ i þ a ¼ b

ð3Þ
ð4Þ

From Deﬁnitions 1 and 2, we can conclude that the conversion
of a linguistic term into a linguistic 2-tuple consists of adding a value 0 as symbolic translation:

Dðsi Þ ¼ ðsi ; 0Þ

ð5Þ

Deﬁnition 4. Let (sk, ak) and (sl, al) be two 2-tuple, they should have
the following properties (Herrera & Martínez, 2000a, 2000b, 2001;
Herrera et al., 2005).
(1) If k < l then (sk, ak) is smaller than (sl, al),
(2) If k = l then,
(a) if ak = al, then (sk, ak), (sl, al) represents the same
information,
(b) if ak < al then (sk, ak) is smaller than (sl, al),
(c) if ak > al then (sk, ak) is bigger than (sl ,al).
Deﬁnition 5. A 2-tuple negation operator.

Let S = {siji = 1, 2, . . . , t} be a linguistic term set with odd cardinality. Any label, si represents a possible value for a linguistic variable,
and it should satisfy the following characteristics (Herrera & Martínez, 2000a, 2000b, 2001; Herrera et al., 2005):
(1) The set is ordered: si > sj, if i > j; (2) Max operator: max(si, sj) = si, if si P sj; (3) Min operator: min(si, sj) = si, if si 6 sj. For
example, S can be deﬁned as

where t is the cardinality of S, S = {s1, s2, . . . , st} (Herrera & Martínez,
2000a, 2000b, 2001; Herrera et al., 2005).
Up to now, many operators have been proposed for aggregating
information. Two of the most common operators for aggregating
arguments are the weighted averaging operator and the ordered
weighted averaging operators which are deﬁned as follows,
respectively.

S ¼ fs1 ¼ extremely poor; s2 ¼ v ery poor; s3 ¼ poor; s4 ¼ medium;

Deﬁnition 6. Let WA: Rn ? R, if WA

s5 ¼ good; s6 ¼ v ery good; s7 ¼ extremely goodg
Herrera and Martínez (2000a, 2000b) developed the 2-tuple fuzzy
linguistic representation model based on the concept of symbolic
translation. It is used for representing the linguistic assessment
information by means of a 2-tuple (si, ai), where si is a linguistic label from predeﬁned linguistic term set S and ai is the value of symbolic translation, and ai 2 [À0.5, 0.5).
Deﬁnition 1. Let b be the result of an aggregation of the indices of
a set of labels assessed in a linguistic term set S, i.e., the result of a
symbolic aggregation operation, b 2 [1, t], being t the cardinality of
S. Let i = round(b) and a = b À i be two values, such that, i 2 [1, t]
and a 2 [À0.5, 0.5) then a is called a Symbolic Translation (Herrera
and Martínez, 2000a, 2000b, 2001; Herrera et al., 2005).

Then WA is called a weighted averaging operator, where

x = (x1, x2, . . .P
, xn)T is the weight vector of (a1, a2, . . . , an), with
xj 2 [0, 1]and nj¼1 xj ¼ 1; R is the set of all real numbers (Harsanyi,
1995).
Deﬁnition 7. An ordered weighted averaging operator of dimension n is a mapping OWA: Rn ? R that has an associated vector
P
w = (w1, w2, . . . , wn)T such that wj > 0 and nj¼1 wj ¼ 1. Furthermore,

where (r(1), r(2), . . . , r(n)) is a permutation of (1, 2, . . . , n), such that
ar(jÀ1) P ar(j) for all j = 2, . . . , n (Yager, 1988).
From Deﬁnitions 6 and 7, we know that the WA operator ﬁrst
weights all the given arguments and then aggregates all these
weighted arguments into a collective one. The fundamental aspect
of the OWA operator is the reordering step; it ﬁrst reorders all the
given arguments in descending order and then weights these ordered arguments, and ﬁnally aggregates all these ordered weighted
arguments into a collective one. The WA and OWA operators, however, have usually been used in situations where the input arguments are the exact values. Herrera and Martínez (2000a, 2000b)
extended the WA and OWA operators to accommodate the situations where the input arguments are 2-tuple linguistic assessment
information.
Deﬁnition 8. Let x = {(r1, a1), (r2, a2), . . . , (rn, an)} be a set of 2-tuple,

3. Some extended geometric aggregation operators with 2-tuple

2000a, 2000b).
The ordered weighted geometric (OWG) operator is an aggregation operator that Chiclana, Herrera, and Herrera-Viedma (2000)
deﬁned and characterized to design multiplicative decision-making models (Chiclana, Herrera, & Herrera-Viedma, 2001; Herrera,
Herrera-Viedma, & Chiclana, 2001, 2003). It is based on the ordered
weighted averaging (OWA) operator (Yager, 1988) and on the geometric mean. The OWG operator can only be used in situations
where the input arguments are the exact numerical values. Recently, Jiang and Fan (2003b) extended the OWG operator to
accommodate the situations where the input arguments are linguistic variables.

From Deﬁnitions 15 and 16, we know that the ET-WG operator
weights the given arguments, and the ET-OWG operator ﬁrst reorders the weighted arguments in descending order and weights
these ordered arguments by the ET-OWG weights, and ﬁnally
aggregates all the weighted arguments into a collective one.

with 2-tuple linguistic assessment information

which both the weights and the attribute preference values take

Let us suppose there is an investment company, which wants to
invest a sum of money in the best option (adapted from Herrera &
Herrera-Viedma (2000b)). There is a panel with ﬁve possible alternatives to invest the money: A1 is a car company; A2 is a food company; A3 is a computer company; A4 is an arms company; A5 is a TV
company. The investment company must take a decision according
to the following four attributes: G1 is the risk analysis; G2 is the
growth analysis; G3 is the social-political impact analysis; G4 is
the environmental impact analysis. HT = (P, EP, VP, M) is the linguistic weighting vector of the attributes Gj (j = 1, 2, 3, 4). The ﬁve possible alternatives Ai (i = 1, 2, . . . , 5) are to be evaluated using the
linguistic term set

For the multiple attribute group decision making problems, in
which both the weights and the attribute preference values take
the form of 2-tuple linguistic information, we have developed
some new aggregation operators: the exteded 2-tuple weighted
geometric (ET-WG) and exteded weighted geometric (ET-OWG)
operator and properties of the operators are analyzed. Then, a
method based on the ET-WG and ET-OWG operators for multiple
attribute group decision-making is presented. In this approach,
alternative appraisal values are calculated by the aggregation of
2-tuple linguistic information. Thus, the ranking of alternative or
selection of the most desirable alternative(s) is obtained by the
comparison of 2-tuple linguistic information. Finally, a numerical
example is used to illustrate the applicability and effectiveness of
the proposed method. Theoretical analyses and numerical results
all show that the method is straightforward and has no loss of
information. In the future, we shall continue working in the application of the geometric aggregation operators with 2-tuple linguistic assessment information to other domains.
