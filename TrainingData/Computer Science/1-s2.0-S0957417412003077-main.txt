In order to determine how data mining techniques (DMT) and their applications have developed, during
the past decade, this paper reviews data mining techniques and their applications and development,
through a survey of literature and the classiﬁcation of articles, from 2000 to 2011. Keyword indices
and article abstracts were used to identify 216 articles concerning DMT applications, from 159 academic
journals (retrieved from ﬁve online databases), this paper surveys and classiﬁes DMT, with respect to the
following three areas: knowledge types, analysis types, and architecture types, together with their applications in different research and practical domains. A discussion deals with the direction of any future
developments in DMT methodologies and applications: (1) DMT is ﬁnding increasing applications in
expertise orientation and the development of applications for DMT is a problem-oriented domain.
(2) It is suggested that different social science methodologies, such as psychology, cognitive science
and human behavior might implement DMT, as an alternative to the methodologies already on offer.
(3) The ability to continually change and acquire new understanding is a driving force for the application
of DMT and this will allow many new future applications.

1. Introduction
Data mining techniques (DMT) have formed a branch of applied
artiﬁcial intelligence (AI), since the 1960s. During the intervening
decades, important innovations in computer systems have led to
the introduction of new technologies (Ha, Bae, & Park, 2000), for
web-based education. Data mining allows a search, for valuable
information, in large volumes of data (Weiss & Indurkhya, 1998).
The explosive growth in databases has created a need to develop
technologies that use information and knowledge intelligently.
Therefore, DMT has become an increasingly important research area
(Fayyad, Djorgovski, & Weir, 1996).
Of the data mining techniques developed recently, several major kinds of data mining methods, including generalization, characterization, classiﬁcation, clustering, association, evolution, pattern
matching, data visualization and meta-rule guided mining, are
herein reviewed. The techniques for mining knowledge from different kinds of databases, including relational, transactional, object
oriented, spatial and active databases, as well as global information
systems, are also examined. Potential data mining applications and
some research issues are discussed.
As an element of DMT research, this paper surveys the development of DMT, through a literature review and the classiﬁcation of
articles, from 2000 to 2011. The various applications of DMT, during that period, are reviewed. This period is especially important,
because the Internet was opened to general users, in 2000, and

the newly widespread availability of information and communication technology has played an important role, not only in the ﬁeld
of DMT, but also in the development of methodologies for the collection of data from online databases.
The period of interest, for this literature survey, begins in January
2000. In August, 2011, a search was made of the keyword indices on
the Elsevier SCOPUS, Springerlink, IEEE Xplore, EBSCO (electronic
journal service) and Wiley InterScience online database, for article
abstracts containing the phrase, ‘‘data mining technique’’. For the
period from 2000 to 2011, 14,972 articles were found. Topic ﬁltering
reduced this number to 216 articles, from 159 journals, which were
related to the keyword, ‘‘Data mining application’’. Using these 216
articles on DMT applications, this paper surveys and classiﬁes DMT,
using nine categories: Neural networks, Algorithm architecture,
dynamic prediction-based, Analysis of systems architecture,
Intelligence agent systems, Modeling, knowledge-based systems,
System optimization and Information systems, together with their
applications in different research and practical domains.
The remaining part of the paper is organized as follows. Sections
3–11 present the survey results for DMT methodologies and applications, based on the categories mentioned, above. Section 12 is a
discussion of suggestions for the future development of DMT methodologies and their applications. Finally, Section 13 contains a brief
conclusion.
2. Trend in data mining techniques
The data collected dates from 2000, until August 2011. The
trend for the keywords; Data mining, Decision tree, Artiﬁcial

computing, dyadic wavelet, pre-fetching, fault restoration prediction models, fault prediction models, ﬁnancial distress prediction
models, Vlasov–Maxwell equations, chemical reactivity predictions, real time vehicle tracking, forecasting, anomaly detection,
churn prediction, comparative genomics, clinical predictions and
predictive models. Table 4 categorizes predictions into read-set
predictions and write-set predictions.

neural network, Clustering, Association rule, Artiﬁcial intelligence,
Bioinformatics, Customer relationship, Fuzzy logic, and their applications, are shown in Table 1.
3. Neural networks and their applications
The term, neural network, is traditionally used to refer to a network, or circuit of biological neurons. Modern use of the term often
refers to artiﬁcial neural networks, which are composed of artiﬁcial
neurons, or nodes. As well as electrical signaling, other forms of
signaling arise from neural transmitter diffusion, which have an effect on electrical signaling. As such, neural networks are extremely
complex.
Some applications for neural networks are radial basis function
networks, neural classiﬁcation, Bayesian conﬁdence propagation
neural networks, gene regulatory networks, fuzzy recurrent neural
networks, neural nets, back-propagation artiﬁcial neural networks,
Bayesian networks, general regression neural networks and ﬂow
networks. The neural network technique and its applications are
detailed in Table 2.

6. Analysis of system architecture and its applications
The analysis of system architecture uses a conceptual model
that deﬁnes the structure, behavior and other aspects of a system.
Systems architecture makes use of elements of both software and
hardware, which allows the design of composite systems. A good
architecture may be viewed as a ’partitioning scheme’, or algorithm, which completely partitions all of the system’s present
and foreseeable requirements into a workable set of clearly
bounded subsystems.
Some applications of the analysis of system architecture are
semantic analysis, regression analysis, statistical analysis, discriminative analysis, association analysis, penalized discriminative
analysis, process parameter analysis, cluster analysis, decision
making, decision support systems, consumer behavior analysis,
binary logistical regression analyses, M5 model trees, factor
analysis, market basket analysis, collaborative ﬁltering, data
analysis, decision tree based models, principal component analysis,
multi-feature selection, intrusion detection and hem dialysis.
These System architectures and their applications are listed in
Table 5.

4. Algorithm architecture and its applications
Algorithm architecture is expressed as a ﬁnite list of well-deﬁned instructions, to calculate a function. Algorithms are used for
calculation, data processing and automated reasoning. Simply
put, an algorithm is a step-by-step procedure for calculation. A partial formalization of the concept began with attempts to solve the
Entscheidungs problem, posed by David Hilbert in 1928.
Some applications that are implemented by algorithms include
gap statistic algorithms, chi-square automated interaction detection, models and algorithms, GRASP, OLAP, k-means, Clustering
algorithms, decision forest algorithms, classiﬁcation and regression
trees, Euclidean distance, bagged clustering algorithms, fuzzy logic,
association rules, C&RT, Apriori algorithms, C5, anomaly-based IDS,
clustering, genetic algorithms, CRISP-DM models, thyroid stimulation and SVM. Algorithm architectures and their applications are
listed in Table 3.

7. Intelligence agent systems and their applications
In the ﬁeld of artiﬁcial intelligence, an intelligent agent system
(IAs) is an autonomous entity, which observes and acts upon an
environment. Intelligent agents may also learn, or use knowledge
to achieve their goals. They may be very simple, or very complex.
A reﬂex machine, such as a thermostat is an intelligent agent, as
is a human being, as is a community of human beings working
together towards a goal. Russell and Norvig (2003) considered
goal-directed behavior as the essence of intelligence and so
borrowed the term, ‘‘rational agent’’, from economics.
Some applications for intelligence agent systems include
multi-agent systems, complex systems, computer interface design,
multiuser database systems, intelligent analysis, manufacturing
intelligence, intelligent tutoring systems, support vector machines,
program diagnostics systems, supervisory and specialist systems,
supervisory and specialist systems, computing intelligence,
artiﬁcial intelligence and Mahalanobis Taguchi systems. These
intelligent agent systems and their applications are detailed in
Table 6.

5. Dynamic prediction based approach and its applications
The dynamic prediction based approach is a mathematical model for stochastic dynamics; used in modeling molecules, but it also
ﬁnds applications in the stock market, among other areas. The
most important feature of Langevin dynamics is the presence of a
Gaussian random noise. The principle of temporal locality was
widely studied and applied to different domains of computer science by Peter in 1968. It observes that a thread does not access a
completely random set of addresses across its transactions.
Some applications which use a dynamic prediction based approach include ophthalmic oncology, vehicle fault diagnosis, grid

quantitative methods for the analysis of data, to represent, or acquire expert knowledge, using inductive logic programming, or
algorithms, so that AI, cognitive science and other research ﬁelds
are afforded broader platforms for the development of DMT.
Applications of modeling include cost modeling, model-based
diagnosis, forest ﬁre proliferation modeling, model output statistics, intonation modeling, XML document modeling, Cox proportional hazard modeling, load damage exponents, polynomials,
similar waveforms, simple additive weight, computer numerical
control, meta learning and drug utilization. The applications of
modeling techniques are listed in Table 7.

9. Knowledge-based systems and their applications
Knowledge-based systems are artiﬁcial intelligent tools that
work in a narrow domain, to provide intelligent decisions, with
justiﬁcation. The most common deﬁnition of KBS is human-centered, since KBS have their roots in the ﬁeld of artiﬁcial intelligence
(AI). They represent attempts to understand and initiate human
knowledge, in computer systems (Wiig, 1994).

Knowledge is acquired and represented, using various knowledge representation techniques, rules, frames and scripts. The basic
advantages offered by such systems are the documentation of
knowledge, intelligent decision support, self-learning, reasoning
and explanation. Akerkar and Sajja Priti Srinivas (2009) stated that
knowledge-based systems are systems based on the methods and
techniques of Artiﬁcial Intelligence.
Some applications of knowledge-based systems include learning techniques, auto control techniques, knowledge discovery in
databases, knowledge spirals, communication technologies,
knowledge measurement, knowledge extraction, knowledge acquisition, knowledge management, knowledge representation, digital
libraries and information gain theory data mining. The applications
of knowledge-based systems are listed in Table 8.

10. System optimization and its applications
12. Discussions, limitations, and suggestions
Fermat and Lagrange used calculus-based formulas, for the
identiﬁcation of optima, while Newton and Gauss proposed iterative methods of approaching an optimum. Historically, the original
term for optimization was ‘‘linear programming’’, coined by George
B. Dantzig, although much of the theory had been described by
Leonid Kantorovich, in 1939.
Dantzig published the Simplex algorithm, in 1947, and developed the theory of duality, in the same year. System Optimization
refers to the selection of a best element, from some set of available
alternatives. In the simplest case, problems in which a real function
is maximized, are solved by systematically choosing the values of
real or integer variables, from within an allowed set.
Some applications of system optimization include electrical
nerve stimulation, R-peak detection, latent reference individual
extraction methods, operation optimization values, vertical partitioning, logistical regression, analytical hierarchy processes, polynomial regression, biogeography based optimization, particle
swarm optimization, ﬁnite element methods, discrete rough set
methods, asymptotic methods and parallel computing. The applications of system optimization techniques are listed in Table 9.
11. Information systems and their applications
Information systems are the products of an academic discipline.
They occupy a place between the business world and computer science bridging the business ﬁeld and the well-deﬁned computer science ﬁeld that is evolving toward a new scientiﬁc area of study. An
information system relies on the theoretical foundations of information and computing which allows researchers a unique opportunity to engage in academic studies of various business models
and related algorithmic processes that are pertinent to computer
science. In general, information systems focus upon the processing
of information within organizations (Hoganson, 2001), especially
within business enterprises. The products of the process can then
be share with society.
Some applications of information systems include patient characteristics, catchment characteristics, mobile databases, self-organizing, feature maps, insurance claims databases, alternating
current ﬁeld measurement, fracture acidizing, latest time sub-series, destination choice, attribute relevance studies, fraudulent
ﬁnancial statements, sequence similarity, case-based reasoning,
anthropometric data, regression spines, economic imbalances,
medium-voltage customer faults, maintenance and engineering,
bank lending, reinforcement learning, supervised learning, arousals, information visualization, customer retention, churn management, pattern discovery, customer relationship management and
uniaxial compressive strength. The applications for information
systems are listed in Table 10.

12.1. Discussions
A top-level analysis of data mining technologies must focus on
data retention. In early attempts at data mining, the data set was
maintained, for future pattern matching. This literature review
shows that DMT application and development has diversiﬁed, in
line with the various authors’ backgrounds, expertise, and areas
of interest. For this reason, some authors are associated with literature concerning more than one methodology, or application.
It is also true that some techniques have common concepts and
types of methodology. For example, dynamic prediction based
methods, knowledge-based systems and neural network applications. A few authors are associated with literature concerning different methodologies and applications. This indicates that the
development of methodologies is also diverse, in accordance with
each author’s research interests and areas of interest. This seems
to indicate that the development of DMT more expertise oriented.
Furthermore, some applications afford a greater opportunity for
the use of different methodologies. For example, neural classiﬁcation, Bayesian conﬁdence propagation neural networks, gene regulatory networks, fuzzy recurrent neural networks, C&RT, Apriori
algorithms, C5, anomaly-based IDS, clustering, genetic algorithms,
CRISP-DM models, thyroid stimulation, Vlasov–Maxwell equations,
chemical reactivity predictions, real time vehicle tracking, forecast,
anomaly detection, churn prediction, knowledge measurement,
knowledge extraction, knowledge acquisition, knowledge manage-

ment and knowledge representation are all topics with different
methodologies, which nevertheless implement DMT, for problems
that are common to all. These applications represent a major part
of DMT development, but many methodologies are used to solve
the problems that are speciﬁc to them. This would seem to imply
that future developments of DMT will be more problem-centered.
In this paper, the articles discussed were sourced from different
discipline areas, including computer science, engineering, medicine, mathematics, earth and planetary sciences, biochemistry,
genetics and molecular biology, business, management and
accounting, social sciences, decision sciences, multidisciplinary,
environmental science, energy, agricultural and biological sciences,
nursing, materials science, pharmacology, toxicology and pharmaceutics, chemistry, health professions, physics and astronomy, economics, econometrics and ﬁnance, psychology, neuroscience,
chemical engineering and veterinary, which were all retrieved
from the Elsevier SCOPUS, Springerlink, IEEE Xplore, EBSCO
(electronic journal service) and Wiley InterScience online database.
Industrial applications of data mining techniques have increased, between 2000 and 2011. Fig. 1 shows the important
DMT trends for association rules, genetic algorithms, clustering,
artiﬁcial neural networks, Apriori algorithms, support vector
machines, feature selection, customer relationship management,
classiﬁcation, neural networks and decision trees.
It cannot be concluded that DMT methodologies and applications are not developed in other science ﬁelds. However, studies
that mention more applications of DMT in different research ﬁelds
must be published, in order to broaden the scope of DMT, in the
academic and practical ﬁelds.
12.2. Limitations
This study has some limitations. Firstly, a widespread literature
review of DMT and its applications presents a difﬁcult task, because of the extensive background knowledge that is required,
when collecting, studying and classifying these articles. Although
acknowledging a limited background knowledge, this paper makes
a brief review of literature concerned with DMT, from 2000 to 2011
in order to determine how DMT and their applications have developed, in this period. Indeed, the categorization of methodologies
and their applications is based on the keyword index and article
abstracts, collected for this research. Some other articles may have
used similar DMT methodologies in their applications, but may not
have a DMT index, so this paper is unaware of these reference
sources. Therefore, the ﬁrst limitation of this article is the author’s
limited knowledge of this subject. Secondly, although 216 articles
from 159 academic journals (ﬁve online databases) are cited in this

paper, other academic journals are listed in the science citation index (SCI) engineering index (EI) and the social science citation index (SSCI), as well as other academic journals/ magazines, practical
articles and reports that are not included in this survey. These
would have provided more complete information about the developments in DMT and their applications. Lastly, non-English publications were excluded from this study. It is believed that research
regarding the application of data mining techniques has also been
discussed and published in other languages.
12.3. Suggestions
(1) Other social science methodologies. This article’s deﬁnition
of DMT is not complete, because other methodologies, such
as social science methodologies, were not included in the
survey. However, qualitative questionnaires and statistical
methods are a type of research technology that is often used
in social studies. For example, cognitive science, psychology
and human behavior are used to implement different methods for investigating speciﬁc human problems, so other
social science methodologies may include DMT in future
studies.
(2) Integration of methodologies. DMT is an interdisciplinary
research topic, so future development of DMT must be integrated with different methodologies. This integration of
methodologies and cross-disciplinary research may offer
new insights into the problems associated with DMT.
(3) Change is a source of future ES development. Change, due to
social and technical reasons, can either enable, or inhibit ES
methodologies and the development of applications. It can
be seen that inertia, stemming from the use of routine problem solving procedures, stagnant knowledge sources and
reliance on past experience, or knowledge may impede
change, with respect to learning and innovation, for individuals and organizations.
Continued creation, sharing, learning and the acquisition of
knowledge about different methodologies and applications
also plays a key role in ES development.

13. Conclusions
This paper presents a review of literature concerned with DMT
and its applications, from 2000 to 2011. It used a search of keyword
indices and article titles. It is concluded that development of DMT is
tending to become more expertise-oriented and that the development of DMT applications is more problem-centered. It is suggested
that different social science methodologies, such as psychology,
cognitive science and human behavior might use DMT as an alternative methodology. Integration of qualitative, quantitative and
scientiﬁc methods and the integration of studies of DMT methodologies will increase understanding of the subject. Finally, the ability
to continually change and provide new understanding is the principle advantage of DMT methodologies, and will be at the core of DMT
applications, in future.
