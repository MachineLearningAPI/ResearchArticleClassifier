The present communication deals with the synthesis of luminescent Mn-doped ZnS quantum dots (QDs)
anchored to surface imprinted polymer for the optical sensing of 3-phenoxy benzoic acid (3-PBA) in urine
samples. The combination of sensing and surface functionalization not only improves the selectivity of
the method, but also increases the optosensing ability of the material for non-phosphorescent substances. The developed material was utilized for the selective and sensitive detection of 3-PBA in urine
samples. The proposed method shows good linearity with a regression coefﬁcient (R2) of 0.98. The limit
of detection was found to be 0.117 lM. The method has an acceptable precision and accuracy which are
found to be less than 8% and 80–90% respectively at three different concentrations. The quenching
constant of quantum dot-molecular imprinted polymer was found to be 3.4 times higher to that of the
quantum dot-non imprinted polymer (QD-NIP) as calculated by Stern–Volmer equation. The sensing
method developed has shown immense utility to detect 3-PBA in complex biological samples like urine.

1. Introduction
In recent years, molecularly imprinting polymers (MIPs) have
shown promising applications in analytical chemistry, and this
synthesized MIPs will have selective binding sites for the template
of interest. The selectivity mainly depends on the size and shape of
the cavity and its rebinding interaction ability [1,2]. This MIPs have
several advantages like simple to prepare, higher stability and
afﬁnity for the analyte recognition and cost-effective. Due to these
advantages, MIPs have found applications for bioseparations,
diagnostic assays, sensors and biocatalysts [3].
Optical sensing is found to be a straightforward method for the
detection of analytes of interests, and it has attracted wide attention from the researchers. Quantum dots (QDs) as optical sensors
have increased use for sensing applications because of their
size-dependent optical properties, large surface to volume ratios
and quantum size effects [4–8]. Advantages of QDs include high
photo stability and photoluminescence efﬁciency, sharp emission
proﬁle and size-dependent emission wavelengths due to which

they adopted for sensing of various compounds in different matrices [9,10]. Since sensing technology is entirely based on speciﬁcity,
so modiﬁcation of the luminescent QDs at its surface is very important for its applications in the analysis. Cadmium based quantum
dots fabricated with silica have been used for optosensing of pyrethroids [11]. Surface modiﬁcation of QDs by using a molecular
imprinting technique paved a good approach for development of
optical sensors. The MIP fabricated QD (QD-MIP) will provide the
selectivity to the material due to presence of binding sites on
the polymer matrix, which helps in the separation of analytes. The
combination of selectivity of MIP with ﬂuorescent properties of
QDs provides newer applications for the detection of the non phosphorescent analyte as it will possess speciﬁc recognition ability
and variable intensity to the analytes of interest [12,13]. Thus the
surface modiﬁcation of QDs of imprinted polymer leads to change
in phosphorescence intensity when the target analyte is recognized by the material [14]. Among the luminescent materials, Mn
and Cu doped ZnS are the widely used material in several ﬁelds
such as photoluminescence materials, in color television, radar
and electroluminescence materials [15–19]. There are reports
available, which utilizes the advantages of phosphorescence of
QD-MIP. Yan and co-workers developed a method to optosense
the pentachlorophenol in water by utilizing the concept of

phosphorescence quenching using Mn doped ZnS quantum dots,
while Lin et al. applied this for the chemiluminescence detection
of 4-nitrophenol in tap water [8]. Mn doped ZnS QDs fabricated
with MIP was also used for the trinitrotoluene sensor through
the ﬂuorescence quenching as demonstrated by Gao et al [20]. To
the best of our knowledge, no application has been reported for
the detection of 3-phenoxybenzoic acid (3-PBA) in urine samples.
3-PBA is a non-speciﬁc and frequently detected metabolite of
pyrethroids such as cypermethrin, deltamethrin, permethrin, cyhalothrin etc. and used as a general marker for the exposure to these
pyrethroids. Besides its antiestrogenic activity, it is also considered
as endocrine disruptor chemical [21–23]. The ill effects of
pyrethroids and 3-PBA are massive ingestion include agitation,
hypersensitivity, tremor, salivation, choreoathetosis and seizures
[24–26]. There is strong evidence of its role in determining the
exposure of pyrethroids in occupational workers [27]. Thus, it is
necessary to detect and analyze 3-PBA so that the implications of
pyrethroids on human health can be known. This will provoke its
low usage, which, subsequently minimize the ill-effects.
3-PBA has been detected by an ELISA (Enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay) method [28] but it involves a tedious sample preparation. Several other methods have been reported in the
analysis of pyrethroid metabolites. These include high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC), liquid chromatography–mass
spectrometry (LC–MS) [29,30], gas chromatography (GC), gas
chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) [31–34] and
immunoassay based methods [35,36]. Although, these methods
have an advantage to quantify 3-PBA in several matrices, but they
are not compatible for on-ﬁeld sensing and monitoring applications. In the present communication, an attempt has been made
to form molecular recognition sites on the surface of Mn doped
ZnS using the molecularly imprinted technique, which is capable
of selective extraction of 3-PBA from complex biological matrices.
The developed method is found to be simple, rapid and selective
for the 3-PBA detection in urine samples.
2. Experimental
2.1. Chemicals and reagents
All the reagents used in the study were of analytical grade
unless otherwise stated. Zinc sulfate heptahydrate (ZnSO4Á7H2O),
manganese (II) chloride tetrahydrate (MnCl2Á4H2O) (97% purity),
tetraethyl orthosilicate (P99%) (TEOS), 3-Aminopropyl triethoxy
silane (P98%) (APTES), 3-mercaptopropyl triethoxy silane (MPTS)
and 3-phenoxybenzoic acid (3-PBA) were procured from Sigma
Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). All the solvents used were procured
from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany) and Sd. Fine Pvt. Limited
(Mumbai, India). Sodium sulﬁde (Na2SÁxH2O) purchased from Sd.
Fine Pvt. Limited (Mumbai, India). Phosphate buffer saline (PBS)
of 30 mM was prepared as a stock solution by addition of 30 mM
of Na2HPO4 and 30 mM of NaH2PO4. The pH of the buffer solution
was maintained by 30 mM H3PO4 and 0.1 M NaOH solutions. Fresh
aqueous solutions in milli Q water of standards and samples were
prepared during experiments.
2.2. Synthesis of MPTS capped Mn doped ZnS quantum dots
The MPTS capped Mn doped ZnS quantum dots were synthesized by following the earlier reported method with slight modiﬁcation [10]. Brieﬂy, to a three necked ﬂask, ZnSO4 (10 mmol),
MnCl2 (1 mmol), and 50 mL of water was added and the mixture
was stirred under nitrogen at room temperature for 10 min. To
this, 10 mL of aqueous solution containing Na2S (10 mmol) was
added drop wise and kept the mixture under stirring for 30 min.

To this, MPTS (0.5 mmol) dissolved in 10 mL of ethanol was added,
and the reaction was kept for 20 h on stirring at room temperature.
To ensure the purity and crystalline, the synthesized material was
thoroughly washed with ethanol and water to remove unreacted
parts. The material was kept in the oven at 90 °C for drying, which
leads to highly crystalline QD.
2.3. Synthesis of MIP capped Mn doped ZnS QDs
To a 50 mL ﬂask, 10 mL alcoholic solution of 3-PBA (100 mg,
template) and 250 lL of APTES (functional monomer) was added
and stirred for 30 min. To the resultant mixture, 1 mL of TEOS
(cross-linker) was added, and the mixture was kept stirring for
5 min. Then MPTS capped Mn doped ZnS QDs (400 mg) and 2 mL
of 6% aqueous ammonia solution was added and stirred for 16 h.
The non-imprinted polymer (NIP) was synthesized simultaneously
without adding template. The resulting MIP and NIP were obtained
after centrifugation and washed with ethanol followed by water
and oven dried before use. The template was removed from
QD-MIP (Quantum Dot-Molecularly Imprinted Polymer) through
washing with methanol: acetic acid (9:1, v/v) several times.
Finally, the particles were dried for further use.
2.4. Instrumentation
The size of the nanocrystal was observed using transmission
electron microscopy (TEM, Tecnai-G2-SPIRIT FEI, Netherland). A
drop of aqueous solution of QDs was placed on the copper grid
to obtain images after sonication and coated with formvar.
Absorbance, excitation and band gap energy were derived using a
spectrophotometer, (SPECORD 210 PLUS, Analytik Jena, Germany).
Fluorescence spectra of the QDs were obtained at an excitation and
emission spectral wavelength of 330 and 590 nm, respectively (LS
55 photoluminescence spectrometer, Perkin Elmer, UK). The
interactions of the functional group characterization of MPTS
capped Mn:ZnS QDs and MIP modiﬁed QDs were performed using
Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) (Nicolet 6700,
Thermo scientiﬁc, USA). The crystal lattice of the synthesized QD
was obtained by using X-ray diffraction (XRD) using Cu target
source (SEIFERT, Germany) at ACMS Lab, IIT Kanpur.
2.5. Photoluminescence study
Different concentrations of 3-PBA (0.15–60 lM) were prepared
from stock solution. An aliquot of 2.5 mL of each concentration of
3-PBA and 2 mL of PBS buffer (pH 8) was mixed with 2.5 mL of
Mn: ZnS QD-MIP solution (20 mg LÀ1) and then the system was
stabilised at rest for few minutes for interacting the analyte with
QD-MIP. The complete dispersion was collected, and from this
3 mL volume of the mixture was transferred to a cuvette for the
photoluminescence study. The same procedure was followed for
the QD-NIP (Quantum Dot-Molecularly non-Imprinted polymer)
interaction with the template (3-PBA) at the speciﬁed concentrations. The urine samples used in the study were spiked at given
concentrations and were diluted 50 times with water prior to the
analysis. The phosphorescence quenching was measured at an
excitation wavelength of 330 nm by keeping the slit width of
15 nm and an emission ﬁlter at 515 nm.
2.6. Selectivity study
The selectivity of the synthesized QD-MIP was performed by
taking 2, 5-dihydroxy benzoic acid (2,5-DHBA) at the concentrations of 0.15–60 lM using the same procedure described above.
All other parameters of the analysis were same.

2.7. Method validation
Validation assay of the developed method was performed with
respect to limit of detection (LOD), precision, linearity and recovery. Calibration of 3-PBA was performed in the concentration range
of 0.15–60 lM in urine. LOD was calculated using the formula,
LOD = 3.3 r/S, where r is the standard deviation of the response
and S is the slope of the calibration curve. Precision study (intraand inter-day) was carried using synthesized QD-MIP as an optical
sensor at three concentration levels (1, 30 and 60 lM) in a day and
also for ﬁve successive days. Recovery study was carried at three
concentration levels (1, 30 and 60 lM) in urine. All the validation
assays were performed in triplicate (n = 3).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Synthesis of QD and QD-MIP
The MPTS capped Mn doped ZnS quantum dots were synthesized by precipitating zinc sulﬁde from the precursors. Zinc precursor was obtained from zinc sulfate and sulfur precursor from
sodium sulﬁde in the equimolar ratio to obtain 1:1 atomic ratio
of ZnS. Doping was done instantly with nucleation so that surface
defects could be obtained on the pure crystal lattice. Mn as a
dopant was added initially following precipitation and nucleation
in parallel. Growth of the nucleated particle decides the optical
properties of the material. Homogenous particle growth gives rise
to similar-sized nanoparticle that leads to strong photoluminescence. Growth and size of the synthesized material were controlled
by using MPTS, which acts as a capping agent. MPTS has a signiﬁcant role in synthesizing QD-MIP as it helps in not only synthesizing QDs but also acts as a linker between MIP and QD. The sol–gel
approach was used for the synthesis of MIP by taking APTES as a
monomer and TEOS as cross linker. The synthesis of QD-MIP not
only provides selectivity to the surface by forming speciﬁc
recognition sites for target analyte but also stabilizes the QD from
bleaching or loss of ﬂuorescence. The purity and crystalline nature
of synthesized material are vital for sensing applications of the
analytes. The interactions between template and monomer are
non-covalent (H-bonding) due to which, the 3-PBA can be removed
easily while retaining its imprint on the QD-MIP.

Fig. 1. XRD of QD (curve 2) and QD-MIP (curve 1).

3.2. Characterization of MIP- and NIP capped Mn-doped ZnS QDs
Zinc sulﬁde has a cubic zinc blende structure which is conﬁrmed by the XRD patterns for the QD-MIP. The phase pure peaks
for (1 1 1), (2 2 0), and (3 1 1) is in accordance with the JCPDS No.
05-0566. There are no other peaks in the diffraction pattern of
the synthesized material which conﬁrms the formation of pure
crystalline ZnS. The diffractogram of QD and QD-MIP shows slight
differences in the intensity of peaks this explains that MIP capped
QD is having low crystallinity as compared to pure QD (Fig. 1).
Further, the size for QD and QD-MIP were also calculated by XRD
patterns by using scherer equation [b1/2 = 0.94k/d cosb] [8].
Where b1//2 refers to the full peak width at half maximum, k refers
to the copper target source, d refers to the size of the crystal lattice
and b refers to Bragg’s angle. The size of QD and QD-MIP was calculated as 10 and 13 nm respectively. So, an additional layer of
3 nm on the QD-MIP is attributed to the formation of an MIP layer
on the QD. Further, the size of the QD (Fig. 2a) and QD-MIP (Fig. 2b)
was also measured by TEM and size of QD-MIP was found to be in
the range of 35–40 nm while particles are widely been dispersed
(Fig. 2b). Growth of MIP is slightly controlled due to presence of
template, resulting in well deﬁned surface while the growth of
NIP is uncontrolled due to the absence of template resulting in

highly agglomerated particles. Thus, stable and homogenous
QD-MIP nanoparticles were synthesized that have imprints of
template (3-PBA). The photoluminescence study of quantum dots
shows an excitation at 330 nm while emission at 460 nm, which
is a characteristic peak of ZnS while at 590 nm which is the
characteristic feature of Mn doped ZnS QDs (Fig. 3). PL spectra of
synthesized MPTS capped QDs shows that manganese is incorporated as a dopant in the crystal lattice of zinc sulﬁde. The
QD-MIP shows similar peak having emission at 590 nm and excitation at 330 nm, thus QD has been conjugated properly to the MIP
resulting a stable optosensing material. Further the formation of
MIP has APTES as a monomer and TEOS as crosslinker is also
conﬁrmed by FTIR (Fig. 4a and b). The strong and broad peak at
1101 of QD capped with MPTS was found to be shifted to 1064
after capping with MIP indicates interaction of Si–O–Si and
Si–OH linkage conﬁrms the formation of QD-MIP. The Si–O vibration at 790 and 459 in QD-MIP shows the presence of silane gel like
polymeric network. This indicates that silica cross-linking plays a
key role in the formation of desired polymeric material. Thus,
according to all the characterization methods, it can be inferred
that the particles synthesized has the properties of QD and MIP,
which are the prerequisite for application of nanomaterials as
optical sensors.
3.3. Optimization of the pH of buffer solution used in the assay
Luminescent property of the synthesized QD-MIP may show
interaction with buffer media and can result in quenching of the
phosphorescence. To obtain the suitable pH of the buffer, a
20 mg LÀ1 QD-MIP and QD were kept in PBS buffer in the pH range
of 2–11 (Fig. 5). It was found that the phosphorescent intensity was
very poor in acidic media while the intensity of the QD-MIP

increases in the alkaline conditions (pH 8–11) and remains almost
similar (Fig. 5). Since the pH of urine is generally alkaline in nature,
so PBS buffer of pH 8 was chosen in the study.
3.4. Sensing of 3-PBA by QD-MIPs
The PL study was used as a tool for selective and speciﬁc
analysis of 3-PBA. The synthesized QD-MIP has phosphorescent
emission at 590 nm with an excitation at 330 nm wavelength.
The Mn2+ incorporated in the ZnS lattice is responsible for the
room-temperature phosphorescence at 590 nm. The coating of
MIP on the surface of QDs does not interfere with the optical
property of the QDs. Different concentrations of 3-PBA were
interacted with a speciﬁc amount of QD-MIP & QD-NIP.
Quenching of the phosphorescent intensity of the QD-MIP and
QD-NIP with respect to the addition of 3-PBA (0.15–60 lM) was
studied (Fig. 6a and b). Sensing of the analyte (3-PBA) is based
on the quenching of ﬂuorescent intensity with respect to different
concentrations of quencher (3-PBA). According to Stern–Volmer
equation (Po/P = 1 + KC) [8] where Po is initial photoluminescence
intensity, P is an intensity in presence of the analyte, K is quenching constant and C is the concentration of analyte based on
dynamic quenching [8]. The quenching constant was calculated
for the QD-MIP with respect to QD-NIP and 2, 5-DHBA (as
quencher, analog of 3-PBA) which is 3.4 times of QD-NIP for
3-PBA as quencher and 2 times of 2, 5-DHBA as quencher respectively. Quenching of ﬂuorescence intensity by 2, 5-DHBA was done
to check the selectivity of the imprinted polymer formed using
3-PBA as a template. The results are clearly depicted the high
selectivity of QD-MIP towards 3-PBA as compared to 2, 5-DHBA
(as an analog). Further, the synthesized QD-MIP has been used
for the detection of 3-PBA in urine (complex biological matrix)

by studying the matrix effect. The matrix effect was studied by
checking the quenching intensity in water and urine, while keeping all other parameters constant. It was found that, the change
in the phosphorescence quenching intensity on the addition of
3-PBA in urine was similar to change in phosphorescent quenching
intensity of QD-MIP on addition of 3-PBA in water. Thus, the matrix
effect of the material is negligible in the present method. Hence it
is inferred that the luminescence intensity of the QD-MIP, and its
application in sensor based assay of 3-PBA did not depend much
on the components of the urine matrix.

3.5. Analytical assay of the synthesized QD-MIP
The analytical assay of the proposed method was performed
with respect to linearity, limit of detection (LOD), recovery and
precision. The synthesized MIP-capped Mn-doped ZnS QDs for
3-PBA shows good linearity with R2 value of 0.980 for sensing
3-PBA in the concentration range of 0.15–60 lM. The developed
method was also validated in spiked urine samples and was found
to be successful in sensing 3-PBA in urine. LOD was found to be
0.117 lM. Recovery study of the developed method was found to

Although the material could not quantify the analyte, it has several
other advantages. The sensitivity of the material is very high which
is prerequisite for acting as sensor. It is highly stable and does not
require any sample pretreatment for its determination. Fabrication
of the QD surface by MIP makes the material highly selective for
the target analyte. The developed sensor will ﬁnd wide applications in the routine analysis of 3-PBA as a marker for pyrethroids
exposure.
