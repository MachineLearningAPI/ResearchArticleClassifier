Abstract
Background: Calix[4]arene-methylene-bis-phosphonic acid C-192 and its sodium salt C-145 were shown to be
efficient inhibitors of fibrin polymerization in vitro. In presented work we analyze the effects of сalix[4]arene C-145
on haemostasis in vivo.
Methods: Parameters of coagulation system of rabbits intravenously injected with C-145 were monitored. We
measured thrombin time (TT), ecamulin time (ET) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), determined
the levels of fibrinogen, prothrombin, protein C, PAI-1, monitored overall haemostatic potential before and after the
injection.
Results: C-145 was administrated intravenously in the dose of 7.5 mg/kg of rabbit weight. 4 hours after the
injection the thrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time of rabbit’s blood plasma were prolonged 2 and
1,5 times respectively. Such prolongation was observed after 24 hours as well. However, the total fibrinogen and
prothrombin levels did not change. Parameters of fibrinolytic system (PAI-1, clot lysis half-time) and anticoagulant
system (protein C) remained unchanged.
Conclusions: Therefore we assumed that calix[4]arene C-145’s effects on haemostasis consisted in selective
inhibition of fibrin polymerization and formation of three-dimensional fibrin network.

Introduction
Calix[4]arene-methylene-bis-phosphonic acids are synthetic
macrocyclic compounds obtained by cyclocondensation of parasubstituted phenols and formaldehyde [1]. Aromatic rings of
calix[4]arenes form a lipophilic ‘cup’, an interface tailored to handle
macromolecules through hydrogen bonds, hydrophobicity or
electrostatic interactions. Modified calix[4]arenes are able to bind
specifically to high-molecular compounds [1]. Earlier we found two
of calix[4]arene-methylene-bis-phosphonic acids which specifically
inhibit construction of the blood clot’s carcass, 3-D fibrin network [2].
In particular, calix[4]arene-tetra-methylene-bis-phosphonic acid (С192) and its sodium salt (С-145) specifically inhibited the first stage of
fibrin polymerization, the formation of protofibrils (ІС50 = 0.5·10-6 and
ІС50 = 2,5·10-6 respectively). Structure of C-145 is shown on (Figure 1).
Further research in vitro did not reveal any influence of these calix[4]
arenes on platelets and red blood cells, as well as on Factor X activation,
prothrombin, and protein C [3].
The anti-polymerization properties of С-192 and С-145 allowed us
to consider them as potential compounds for the design a novel class of
antithrombotic agents, which are able to inhibit specifically blood clot
formation through the fibrin polymerization inhibition. To introduce
a medicinal preparation, however, it is necessary to study its effects not
only in vitro, but also in lab animals.

Overall haemostatic potential was studied by monitoring turbidity
during clot formation and lysis. The mixture of 12 μl of citrated human
plasma in 0.05 М НЕРЕS-buffer рН 7.4 (0.15 М NaCl, 5 mМ СаCl2), 75
NIH/ml of tPA was clotted by 5 μl of thromboplastin and turbidity was
monitored at 350 nm at room temperature as described in [7].
PAI-1 was detected using ELISA according to [8]. Mixture was
contain 2 μl of blood plasma in 0.2 ml of TBS. Polyclonal anti-PAI-1
antibody and Goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to alkaline phosphatise
were used for the detection. PNP formed after PNPP cleavage by
alkaline phosphatase was determined at 405 nm using multiplate
reader Multiscan EX.

and Care Committee of Palladin Institute of Biochemistry of NAS of
Ukraine (February 4, 2014, protocol number 1).

Statistical data analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel. All
assays were performed in series of three replicates and the data were
fitted with standard errors using “Statistica 7”.

Results

Blood plasma was prepared from citrated blood by centrifugation
at 1200 rpm during 30 min.

To evaluate the possible effect of the calix[4] arenes on haemostasis
in vivo, healthy rabbits were intravenously injected with 1 ml of С-145
in saline solution (7.5 mg/kg). The quantity amounted to 1.5 % LD50. as
determined for rats injected intraperitoneally [9]. As the total volume
of an adult rabbit’s blood is about 250 ml [10], the level of С-145 was
about 0.06 mg/ml (46 μM). In vitro, this prolonged APTT in blood
plasma 1.7-fold (Р = 0.05) [9].

Activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) was performed
according to the following procedure. 0.1 ml of blood plasma was
mixed with equal volume of APTT-reagent and incubated during 3
minutes at 37 °C. Then the coagulation was initiated by adding of 0.1
ml of 0.025 M solution of CaCl2. Clotting time was monitored by the
Coagulometer Solar CGL-2410 (Belorussia).

Four hours after injection of С-145, APTT of the rabbit’s blood
plasma grew 1.5-fold and TT twice, and they remained so for 24
hr (Figure 2). TT was affected more because fibrin formation and
polymerization are initiated directly by exogenous thrombin, while
in APTT blood coagulation happens indirectly through the intrinsic
pathway.

Thrombin time was performed by adding of 0.125 NIH/ml of
thrombin to the mixture of blood plasma (0.1 ml) with equal volume of
CaCl2 solution (0.025 M). Results were presented as the ratio of blood
plasma clotting time of experimental animal to the control clotting
time. Clotting time was monitored by the Coagulometer Solar CGL2410 (Belorussia).

Therefore the anti-polymerization effect of С-145 shown in vitro
also occurred in the intravenously injected rabbits. C-145 prolonged
coagulation time in both basic tests (APTT & TT) with statistical
significance, albeit unequally: TT grew 1.33 times more (Р = 0.05). It can
be explained by APTT incorporating the whole coagulation cascade,
while in TT we tested the influence of C-145 upon polymerization
of fibrin originating in the last stage of the cascade: the fibrinogen +
thrombin reaction.

Blood samples were collected using Wenflon catheter (Becton
Dickinson, USA), G22 (0.8 mm) before the injection and after 2, 4 and
24 hours after injection. 3.2 % Sodium Citrate added immediately after
collection to whole blood in 1:9 ratio was used as an anticoagulant.

Fibrinogen concentration in the blood plasma was determined by
the modified spectrophotometric method. Blood plasma (0.2 ml) and
PBS (1.7 ml) were mixed in glass tube. Coagulation was initiated by
the addition of 0.1 ml of thrombin (2 NIH/ml). To avoid fibrin crosslinking 0.1 ml of 40 mM monoiodacetic acid was added to the sample.
Mixture was incubated during 30 min at 37°C. The fibrin clot was
removed and re-solved in 5 ml of 1.5 % Acetic acid. The concentration
of protein was measured using spectrophotometer SF-2000 (Russia) at
280 nm (ε =1.5).
Prothrombin level was measured using ecamulin test (ET).
Ecamulin is the prothrombin activator from Echis multisqumatis snake
venom that activates prothrombin and all his inactive forms [5]. So it
allowed us to determine total prothrombin level. Thrombin generation
was measured by chromogenic substrate assay using thrombinspecific S2238. Results were presented as ecamulin (EI) index, that was
calculated by formula: EI = Ap/An; PI= Ap/An, An – normal rabbit’s
blood plasma thrombin activity; Ap – calix[4]arene-treated rabbit’s
blood plasma thrombin activity.
Protein C level was determined using the activator of protein C
according to [6]. The generation of activated protein C was measured
by chromogenic substrate assay using specific chromogenic substrate
S2236.

We also studied an effect the calix[4]arene had on the other blood
coagulation components. Main proteins of the system, fibrinogen
and prothrombin, were not influenced by C-145 injection (Figure 3).
This supports our conclusion about its selective and focused action
only upon the fibrin polymerization stage in the coagulation cascade
without any influence upon other protein factors [3].
The state of anti-coagulation branch of haemostasis system
following С-145 injection was analyzed by protein C quantification in
plasma after 4 and 24 hr.
It was shown that 4 hr after the injection of C-145, protein C level
didn’t practically change (Figure 4). However, later it decreased by 1525 %. That the deficit increases after a whole 24 hr, points that C-145
doesn’t have a direct impact on the anti-coagulation branch of the
system [11].
A number of anti-coagulative preparations are known to coinfluence the fibrinolytic system [12]. It is known that plasminogen
is activated on fibrin. As C-145 interacts with monomeric fibrin,
preventing its polymerization, we had to study its effect on plasminogen
activation, plasmin activity and overall fibrinolysis in plasma [13].

into anti-coagulants, which inhibit clotting on various stages, and
profibrinolytics, which speed up the fibrin clot’s destruction (t-PA,
u-PA, streptokinase) [18,19]. Most anti-coagulants act directly upon
thrombin (dabigatran) [20], factor Ха (rivaraxaban) [21], factors VIIIa
and V (drotrecogin) [22], blocking the clotting cascade on the stages
of factor X activation or prothrombin to thrombin and fibrinogen to
fibrin transformations. A possibility of the use of anti-thrombotics
directly acting upon the last link of blood clot formation, namely

The main direct evidences for the activation of fibrinolytic system
are the rise in plasmin activity in blood plasma and the generation
of plasminogen activator inhibitors (PAI-1, α2-аntiplasmin) [14].
To reveal possible causes of the fibrinolysis inhibition that was seen
after the С-145 injection, we measured PAI-1 in rabbit plasma [15,16].
It remained constant 4 and 24 hr after the injection, there was no
significant difference between the control and the experiment (Figure
5).

plasma before (0) and after 4 and 24 hr after intravenous administration of
C-145.

For a combined analysis of the blood clot’s formation and its
hydrolysis we measured haemostasis potential (HP), clotting potential
(CP) and fibrinolytic potential (FP) in plasma before the injection
and 2 and 4 hr after. The coagulation was initiated by thromboplastin,
together with exogenous tPA to determine HP and FP [17].
After the injection, the HP, CP and FP in plasma were 11.0 -,
12.2- and 9.0-fold lower, respectively (Table 1). These data point to the
very strong impact C-145 has on the plasma’s clotting ability. On the
other hand, it does not significantly influence the balance between the
coagulative and fibrinolytic components of haemostasis, calculated as
the FP/CP ratio (Table 1). This lets us to suppose that the inhibition FP
is caused not by C-145’s action on fibrinolysis, but by the reduction in
size of the hydrolyzed fibrin clot.

Discussion
Antithrombotic preparations act by rapid and controlled decrease
of the activity of blood coagulation. The main criteria of their quality
are efficiency and lack of contraindications. They can be classified

fibrin polymerization, is a hot topic of research [23,24]. In particular,
decreasing of the fibrin polymer density was attempted through
adding silver nano-particles [25] or inhibiting peptides (e.g., GPRP),
conjugated with albumin [26].
In this respect this calix[4]arene, being low-molecular and
potentially non-immunogenic organic molecule may turn out
to be potentially valuable highly specific antithrombotic agents,
inhibiting fibrin polymerization by blocking the A polymerization
site [2]. The effect was revealed to be quite significant in vivo in
rabbits intravenously injected with С-145. Meanwhile it had no
impact upon prothrombin and fibrinogen levels in plasma and no
significant effect upon the activity of the fibrinolysis system and
PAI-1 levels.

Therefore, we found a specific anti-polymerisation effect of the
calix[4]arene С-145 in vivo comparable to effects in vitro. The substance
did not notably influence the total level of prothrombin, fibrinogen,
activity of the anti-coagulative and fibrinolytic systems and the balance
between the fibrin formation and digestion.

The results allow us to consider calix[4]arene C-145 as a potential
anti-thrombotic agent with narrow effect range. The next stage of
research in vivo should focus on its impact upon the vascular-platelet
link of haemostasis.
