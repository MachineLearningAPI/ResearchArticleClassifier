Abstract
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has a very poor prognosis. Meaningful therapeutic options for
unresectable PDAC remain limited and therefore more efficient therapeutic strategies are urgently required. We
explored the approach of manipulating dose intensity of cytotoxic agents through prolonged therapy and by combination
with antiangiogenic agents in experimental PDAC. Median animal survival over controls (19 days) was increased
after prolonged therapy (up to 6 weeks) with gemcitabine to 29 days (a 53% increase, p = 0.008). Addition of two
antiangiogenic agents, bevacizumab and EMAP, further extended median survival to 46 days (a 142% increase, p =
0.0001). Corresponding survival extension after therapy with similar agents limited to 2 weeks was 37% for gemcitabine
and 126% after gemcitabine plus antiangiogenic agents. Pharmacokinetic analysis revealed that the addition of
antiangiogenic agents caused a 4.4-fold increase in gemcitabine plasma concentration and 8-fold increase in tumor
concentration compared with gemcitabine monotherapy group. Prolonged therapy of docetaxel also increased animal
survival (38 days, a 100% increase, p = 0.0004) that was further extended by the addition of the antiangiogenic
combination (49 days, a 158% increase, p = 0.0001). In vitro evaluation of exposure time effects on cell proliferation
revealed that in PDAC cells (AsPC-1) longer exposure (120 h) of gemcitabine or docetaxel caused greater relative
inhibition in cell proliferation compared with 72 h exposure. At 1M concentration, inhibition in cell proliferation after 72
h and 120 h was 27% and 55% (gemcitabine); 64% and 84% (docetaxel). Only in endothelial cells and fibroblasts but not
in PDAC cells did the combination with antiangiogenic agents create additive effects over each cytotoxic agent alone.
These findings demonstrate that increasing bioavailability of cytotoxic agents, both via increased exposure through
prolonged therapy or greater intratumoral dose intensity by combination with antiangiogenic agents could enhance in
vivo antitumor efficacy and thus warrants further investigation.

survival of PDAC patients require immediate attention.

Angiogenesis is an essential and crucial step in the development
and progression of cancer including PDAC. Among several positive
regulators of angiogenesis, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF),
a multifunctional cytokine, is one of the most powerful regulators of
tumor vasculature. VEGF not only promotes angiogenesis by inducing
proliferation, migration, and survival of endothelial cells [14], but
also increases vessel permeability [15]. VEGF is overexpressed in
pancreatic cancer [16], correlates with local disease progression [17]
and poor prognosis [18], providing a strong rationale for exploiting
the therapeutic potential of anti-VEGF agent combinations with an
effective cytotoxic regimen. Bevacizumab, a recombinant humanized
monoclonal antibody against VEGF, was evaluated in PDAC clinical
studies. Although the bevacizumab and gemcitabine combination

Background
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) ranks the fourth most
common cause of all cancer deaths in the United States, and is expected
to become the second-leading cause of cancer death by 2030 [1]. The
prognosis of patients with advanced PDAC remains very poor with a
median survival of 4 to 6 months; for all stages combined, the 5-year
survival rate is only 6% [2]. At the time of diagnosis, about 80% of PDAC
patients are unresectable due to distant metastasis or locoregional
extent [3,4]. Furthermore, in those 10-20% of patients who present
with localized disease and undergo surgical resection, rapid distant
or locoregional relapse is very common [4,5]. Therapeutic options
for unresectable PDAC are limited, and single agent gemcitabine
has been the standard of care since 1997 until recently [6]. Taxanes,
docetaxel and paclitaxel, showed promising antitumor activity in
other solid tumors [7,8] but showed dismal activity in PDAC [9,10].
Recently, greater efficacy against advanced pancreatic cancer has been
demonstrated through the combination of gemcitabine with nabpaclitaxel [11] or of multiple cytotoxic agents in form of FOLFIRINOX
[12,13]. Despite these recent trial-based incremental improvements
in patient outcome, prognosis of PDAC patients still remains dismal.

showed some promise in a phase II trial, no significant benefit was
observed in subsequent phase III studies [19]. Endothelial monocyte
activating polypeptide II (EMAP) is a proinflammatory cytokine with
antiangiogenic and anti-endothelial activities. EMAP has potent effects
on endothelial cells such as inhibition of proliferation, migration,
and induction in apoptosis [20,21]. EMAP suppresses primary and
metastatic tumor growth [20,22,23] that so far could be linked in part
to its inhibitory activity on VEGF and fibronectin signaling [24,25].
EMAP has also been shown to improve gemcitabine and docetaxel
antitumor response [26-28]. Furthermore, in PDAC animal survival
studies, addition of two antiangiogenic agents, bevacizumab and
EMAP, to gemcitabine was more effective than single agent addition,
and a prolonged therapy group with this most effective combination
had some benefit over short term therapy [26]. In the present study,
we examined the antitumor potential for increasing bioavailability
of cytotoxic agents, either via prolonged therapy or by addition of
polymechanistic anti-endothelial therapy with bevacizumab + EMAP,
within experimental pancreatic cancer.

Materials and Methods
Materials
Gemcitabine was purchased from Eli Lilly (Indianapolis, IN).
Docetaxel (Taxotere) was purchased from Sanofi-Aventis (Bridgewater,
NJ). Bevacizumab was purchased from Genentech (South San Francisco,
CA). Recombinant human EMAP was prepared and purified in the lab
as previously described [29], and the cell proliferation reagent WST-1
was purchased from Roche Diagnostic Corporation (Indianapolis, IN).

Cell culture
The human pancreatic cancer cell line AsPC-1 and human fibroblast
cell line WI-38 was purchased from the American Type Culture
Collection (Rockville, MD). AsPC-1 and WI-38 cells were grown in
RPMI 1640 medium and DMEM, respectively (Sigma Chemical Co.
St. Louis, MO) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Human
umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were purchased from
Lifeline Cell Technology (Walkersville, MD) and were grown in
VascuLife medium containing endothelial cell growth supplements.

Cell viability assay

subcutaneous injection of 0.75 x 106 AsPC-1 cells, mice were randomly
grouped and treated intraperitoneally with PBS (control), gemcitabine
(100 mg/kg, twice weekly), bevacizumab (10 µg/mouse, twice weekly)
or EMAP (80 µg/kg, 5 times per week) for two weeks. The tumor size
was measured twice weekly and tumor volume (V) was calculated by
using the formula [V = ½ (L × (W)2], where L = length and W = width
of the tumor mass.
Gemcitabine concentrations in tumor and plasma were analyzed as
previously described [30]. Tumor harvesting and plasma collection were
performed at a time point that was 24 hours after the final bevacizumab
or EMAP treatment and 4 hours after the final gemcitabine treatment.
Tumor samples, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, were homogenized
in PBS containing 100 µg/ml tetrahydrouridine (THU) to prevent
ex vivo metabolism of gemcitabine (2’, 2’-difluoro-2’-deoxycytidine,
dFdC) to the inactive metabolite, 2’-2’-difluorodeoxyuridine (dFdU).
Plasma collection was also performed in the presence of 100 µg/ml of
THU. Analytical methods were developed to detect gemcitabine using
an Applied Biosystems / MDS Sciex 4000 QTRAP mass spectrometer
coupled to a Shimadzu Prominence LC. Chromatography was
performed using a Phenomenex Luna C8 column. Pharmacokinetic
analysis was performed using the Phoenix® WinNonLin® (Certara L.P.,
Princeton, NJ) software package. Non-compartmental modeling with
sparse sampling was utilized.

Animal survival analysis
Animal survival studies were performed using 6 to 8 week old
female NOD/SCID mice, as previously described [31]. Mice were
intraperitoneally injected with AsPC-1 cells (0.75 × 106) and were
randomly grouped (n = 6 to 8 per group) after two weeks. They were
then treated intraperitoneally for two weeks (standard, short-term
therapy) or up to six weeks (prolonged therapy) with PBS (control),
gemcitabine (100 mg/kg, twice per week), docetaxel (4 mg/kg, twice per
week), bevacizumab (10 µg/mouse, twice per week) or EMAP (80 µg/
kg, 5 times per week) or until the need to discontinue treatment earlier.
In these cases, animals were euthanized when apparently moribund
according to predefined criteria including rapid body weight gain or
loss (>15%), tumor size, lethargy, inability to remain upright and lack
of strength. Animal survival was evaluated from the start of therapy
until death.

In vitro cell proliferation assays were performed in 96-well plates
using the colorimetric WST-1 reagent. Four thousand cells were plated
in a 96-well plate and after 16 hours the medium was replaced with
low serum medium. Cells were treated with gemcitabine, docetaxel,
bevacizumab and EMAP. The range of concentrations used for
gemcitabine, docetaxel and EMAP were from 50 nM to 10 µM; and
for bevacizumab 10 µg/ml to 1 mg/ml. After 72 h or 120 h incubation,
WST-1 reagent (10 µl) was added in each well and absorbance was
measured at 450 nm after 2 hours using a microplate reader. Drug
sensitivity graphs were plotted using GraphPad Prism 6.0 software
(GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA).

to food and water ad libitum. Animal experiments were performed
according to the guidelines and approved Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee protocols of the University of Texas Southwestern
Medical Center (Dallas, TX; protocol number 2008-0348) and the
Indiana University School of Medicine (South Bend, IN; protocol
number 16-023). Athymic female nu/nu mice (4-6 weeks) were used
to establish the subcutaneous xenograft model. Two weeks after

In vitro cell proliferation assay results are expressed as mean
± standard deviation (SD). Statistical significance was analyzed by
the two-tailed Student’s t-test using GraphPad Prism 6.0 Software.
Significant differences in animal survival between groups were
determined by log-rank testing using GraphPad Prism 6.0 Software.
P values of <0.05 were considered to represent statistically significant
group differences.

Results

Human intraperitoneal xenograft studies in NOD/SCID mice
resulted in a median survival of 19 days in the PBS treated control
group. Relative to controls, median survival was significantly increased
by a prolonged therapy of gemcitabine (29 days, a 53% increase, p =
0.008). There was a minor survival benefit after prolonged therapy
with antiangiogenic agents alone (22 days, a 16% increase, p = 0.02).
Gemcitabine-mediated animal survival was further extended by

the addition of antiangiogenic agents (46 days, a 142% increase, p =
0.0001; Figure 1A). The relative increase in median animal survival by
prolonged therapy was significantly higher than the corresponding
median survival extension after standard therapy with similar agents
limited to 2 weeks; in this case, the increase in survival was 37% for
gemcitabine and 126% after gemcitabine plus antiangiogenic agents,
respectively (Figure 1B). There were no apparent toxicity-related
signals in terms of rapid animal weight loss or gain (>15%), general
appearance, habitus and activity levels, during the therapy period until
approximately a week before animal death.

antiangiogenic agents also caused an 8-fold increase in gemcitabine
tumor concentrations compared with the gemcitabine monotherapy
group (Figure 1C). Furthermore, we observed that corresponding
with the increase in gemcitabine concentration in plasma and tumor
by addition of antiangiogenic agents, the same antiangiogenic agents
created additive effects on gemcitabine-mediated local tumor growth
inhibition (data not shown).

Gemcitabine concentration in tumor and plasma: effect of
addition of antiangiogenic agents

Evaluation of animal survival benefit by prolonged therapy with
docetaxel revealed that compared to controls (19 days) docetaxel
therapy increased animal survival to 38 days (a 100% increase, p =
0.0004) (Figure 2). The improvement in animal survival through
prolonged docetaxel therapy was greater than the 75% increase
after standard two-week docetaxel therapy as reported earlier [28].
Prolonged docetaxel therapy-related animal survival was further
extended by the addition of antiangiogenic agents to 49 days (a 158%
increase, p = 0.0001) (Figure 2). Again, there were no apparent toxicity

Evaluation of the mechanism by which antiangiogenic agents may
enhance the gemcitabine antitumor response revealed that addition of
antiangiogenic agents increased gemcitabine concentration in tumor
and plasma (Figure 1C). Addition of antiangiogenic agents caused
a 4.4 fold increase in gemcitabine plasma concentration compared
with the gemcitabine monotherapy group. Furthermore, addition of

Effect of chemotherapy exposure time and addition of
antiangiogenic agents on PDAC cell in vitro proliferation
In vitro cell proliferation analysis in AsPC-1 cells exposed
to gemcitabine showed a significant dose- and exposure timedependent inhibition in cell proliferation (Figure 3). At 1 µM and 10
µM gemcitabine, inhibition in cell proliferation was 27% and 44%
after 72 h of drug exposure, respectively. With similar gemcitabine
concentrations, this inhibition was 55% and 69% after 120 h of drug
exposure (Figure 3A). Single agent bevacizumab or EMAP had no
significant inhibitory effect on AsPC-1 cell proliferation (Figure 3B).
Furthermore, combination of gemcitabine with antiangiogenic agents
had no significant additive effects after 72 h or 120 h of drug exposure
(Figure 3B).
Similarly, at 1 µM and 10 µM docetaxel, inhibition in cell
proliferation was 64% and 67% after 72 h of drug exposure, compared
to 83% and 86% after 120 h of drug exposure (Figure 4A). Again, single
agent bevacizumab and EMAP showed no significant inhibitory effect
on AsPC-1 cell proliferation, and the combination of docetaxel with
antiangiogenic agents had no significant additive effects after 72 h or
120 h of drug exposure (Figure 4B).

Effect of chemotherapy exposure time and addition of
antiangiogenic agents on endothelial cell and fibroblast proliferation
In HUVECs, 1 µM and 10 µM concentrations of gemcitabine caused
75% and 79% inhibition in cell proliferation after 72 h of drug exposure.
Single agent bevacizumab at 500 µg/ml and 1 mg/ml concentrations
caused 13% and 22% inhibition in cell proliferation after 72 h of drug
exposure. Single agent EMAP at 5 µM and 10 µM caused 14% and
22% inhibition in cell proliferation after 72 h of exposure (Figure 5).
Combination of gemcitabine with antiangiogenic agents resulted in
additive effects on proliferation inhibition. Combination treatment
of gemcitabine (1 µM) with bevacizumab (500 µg/ml), EMAP (5 µM)
or bevacizumab + EMAP caused 77%, 80% and 86% inhibition in cell
proliferation (Figure 5). In HUVECs, effect of 120 h exposure time
of gemcitabine and combination of antiangiogenic agents at similar
concentrations could not be evaluated in part due to significant cell
death in the control group without drug treatment.
In WI-38 fibroblast cells, gemcitabine concentrations 1 µM and
10 µM caused 70% and 77% inhibition in cell proliferation after 72 h
of drug exposure. Single agent bevacizumab at 500 µg/ml and 1 mg/
ml concentrations caused 12% and 29% inhibition in cell proliferation
after 72 h drug exposure. Single agent EMAP at 5 µM and 10 µM
caused 17% and 27% inhibition in cell proliferation after 72 h exposure
(Figure 6). Combination of gemcitabine with antiangiogenic agents
resulted in additive effects on proliferation inhibition, since 1 µM

72 h or 120 h. After incubation, 10 l WST-1 reagent was added in each well and incubated for 2 additional hours. The absorbance at 450 nm was measured using

or bevacizumab + EMAP caused 72%, 78% and 88% inhibition in cell
proliferation (Figure 6). Similar to HUVECS, in WI-38 cells the effect
of 120 h exposure of gemcitabine in combination with antiangiogenic
agents could not be evaluated due to significant cell death in notreatment control group.

Discussion
Pancreatic cancer is characterized by rapid progression,
invasiveness and marked resistance to conventional chemotherapy.
Systemic chemotherapy remains the only therapeutic option for most
patients either due to unresectable disease at diagnosis or recurrence
after pancreatectomy. Since current cytotoxic chemotherapy options
remain fairly ineffective, it is important to develop novel strategies
to enhance the tumor response to systemic therapy. The scope of the
present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of altering dose intensity
of cytotoxic agents, either in form of greater exposure over time through
prolonged therapy, or by addition of antiangiogenic agents through
their possible impact on cytotoxic agent delivery into the tumor.
The present study results show the antitumor efficacy of prolonged
therapy of both gemcitabine and docetaxel to a greater level than
2-week therapy in an intraperitoneal xenograft survival model that
is well representative of the progression pattern of PDAC [26,28,32].
Importantly, prolonged therapy did not cause any obvious loss of
efficacy over time, but appeared to lead to additional relative therapeutic
gains for the combination treatment groups. In the model setting used,
Biochem Pharmacol (Los Angel)
ISSN:2167-0501 BCPC, an open access journal

no evidence for loss of antitumor effects with prolonged therapy due to
development of resistance was thus obtained.
Molecular-targeted agents may potentially contribute to
improvement in long-term disease control, and many of these agents
are better tolerated than traditional cytotoxic agents. Targeting tumor
angiogenesis through a polymechanistic approach is an attractive
strategy for PDAC therapy because of their potential for synergistic
interaction with cytotoxic agents, limited toxicity and enhanced
antitumor effects [33]. Previous studies in our lab have shown the
benefits of combining several multitargeting antiangiogenic agents
with cytotoxic chemotherapy for PDAC therapy [26,28,32]. In the
present study, prolonged therapy with antiangiogenic agents alone
generated only a small effect on improving animal survival, but was
able to significantly enhance the survival over gemcitabine and
docetaxel therapy groups. In the process to delineate the mechanism
for enhancement in antitumor activities of chemotherapy agents
by addition of antiangiogenic agents, we demonstrate an increase in
gemcitabine levels within both plasma and tumor. The observed higher
fold change in gemcitabine concentration after antiangiogenic agents
within tumors compared to plasma can in part be explained by a longer
half-life of gemcitabine within tumor due to a greater intratumoral
retention of gemcitabine after dissipation of the earlier peak levels within
plasma and tumor {Dineen, 2010 #31} [30]. Aside from this enhanced
retention of gemcitabine in tumors, a functional normalization of
the tumor vasculature leading to higher uptake of gemcitabine in
tumors in the presence of antiangiogenic agents, will likely be another

additional hours. The absorbance at 450 nm was measured using a microplate reader. The resulting number of viable cells was calculated by measuring absorbance
of color produced in each well. Data are the mean  standard deviation of six replicates.

reason for this phenomenon. Although the exact mechanisms for the
enhancement of cytotoxic therapy response by antiangiogenic agents
remains unclear, some other possibly contributing factors may include
reduced tumor vessel leakiness with a decrease in interstitial pressure,
normalization of tumor microvessels, reduction in desmoplastic tumor
stroma and greater efficacy in growth inhibition of other tumorpromoting cell types within the tumor microenvironment [34]. The
assumption of growth inhibitory effects of antiangiogenic agents on
non-epithelial cellular components of the tumor microenvironment
such as endothelial cells and fibroblasts can be supported by in vitro
data in the present study, and by several previous studies from our lab
[26-28,32].
In any prolonged therapy approach, the risk of cumulative toxicity
is not negligible and therefore the benefits of this approach might have
to be balanced with the potential for possible rate-limiting metabolic
side effects. In our studies, we used twice a week doses of gemcitabine
at 80% of the maximum tolerable dose and docetaxel at 50% of its
maximum tolerable dose and did not observe any significant drugrelated toxicity. Antiangiogenic agents, bevacizumab or EMAP, were
also well tolerated during therapy period.
After observing in vivo benefits of enhanced dose intensity of
cytotoxic agents through prolonged therapy and/or combination
with antiangiogenic agents, we attempted to recreate some in vitro
conditions to study the impact of drug exposure time on different cell
types related to PDAC tumor microenvironment. In PDAC epithelial
cells AsPC-1, gemcitabine and docetaxel caused more inhibition in cell
proliferation at longer incubation time, supporting in vivo prolonged
therapy benefits. These PDAC cells are not further sensitized by
exposure to antiangiogenic agents, corroborating with our previous
studies [26,28,32]. This fact is also not altered by prolonged exposure,
suggesting that prolonged in vivo cytotoxic therapy benefits may be
derived from greater effects against epithelial tumor cells over time,

and that the enhanced combination therapy benefits likely result from
effects on other stromal components. Dense desmoplastic stroma
surrounding malignant epithelial cells is the histological hallmark of
PDAC. It contains several different cellular components including
endothelial cells and fibroblasts [35]. Targeting these endothelial
cells and fibroblasts within the tumor microenvironment is a sensible
approach that carries the potential to enhance traditional cytotoxic
approaches that are mainly directed against epithelial tumor cells. So
far this strategy has shown some promising results for solid tumor
treatment [36,37], although it should be stated that some antistromal
in vivo models have also led to the opposite phenomenon, i.e.
increased tumor progression with worsened survival outcomes [38,39].
In representative endothelial cells and fibroblasts, we observed a
significant impact of gemcitabine at 72 hours of exposure time, and
addition of antiangiogenic agents caused additive effects on inhibition
in cell proliferation. Our relatively simplified in vitro approach to
analyze combination exposure effects on various cell types cannot be
used to draw definitive conclusions about combination mechanisms
within tumors; however, all findings support the notion that increased
cytotoxic drug availability through antiangiogenic effects, greater drug
delivery through prolonged administration and combination toxicity
effects on non-epithelial cell types partake in these mechanisms. The
net results of such possible mechanisms obviously can create enhanced
antitumor benefits that should be of interest for possible clinical
treatment designs.
In summary, we report for the first time that increased bioavailability
of gemcitabine or docetaxel through either prolonged therapy and/or
addition of polymechanistic antiangiogenic agents caused significantly
higher antitumor effects in experimental PDAC. Results observed
after either approach appear to be a due to combined effects against
epithelial and stromal cellular tumor components, and are sufficiently
encouraging to be explored for clinical applications.
