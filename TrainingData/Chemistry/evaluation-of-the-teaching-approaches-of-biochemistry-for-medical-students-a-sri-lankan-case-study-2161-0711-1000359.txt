Abstract
Teaching Biochemistry courses is extremely difficult in preclinical medical education because of monotonous use
of lectures, tutorials, practical and end semester load with end semester examination which is a burden for
undergraduates. Purposes of this study are to identify the effectiveness of teaching methods and implementation of
the best method of teaching Biochemistry course. Participants of this study were second year medical student
(n=177) of Faculty of Medicine, University of Rajarata, Sri Lanka. Two non-compulsory evaluating questions were
administered with each of the candidates when they sat for 2nd MBBS Objective Structured Practical Examination
(OSPE). The students gave high positive rating for the lectures. The preferred order of the teaching method includes
lectures as the first preference and other methods include Student Staff interaction, panel discussion and the least
preference was seminar. To conclude it is found that still students prefer lectures because they get more knowledge
easily with face to face contact.

Structure of Biochemistry

Introduction

The Biochemistry curriculum aims to make students independent,
self-directed and lifelong learners [5]. The curriculum consists of
General Biochemistry, Clinical Biochemistry and Nutritional
Biochemistry. General Biochemistry consist a module “Introduction to
the Study of Man.” Clinical Biochemistry is taught with system based
modules of, Cardiovascular System, Respiratory System,
Musculoskeletal System, Body Fluids, Gastrointestinal System, Urinary
System, Endocrine System, Reproductive System and Nervous System.
Nutritional Biochemistry is conducted as a comprehensive course that
includes modules of energy, protein, fat, mineral and vitamin
metabolism, anthropometry and diet therapy. Learning objectives are
made available to the students via the library where they make copies
at the photocopying unit. The specific learning objectives provide
guidance to the students on the expected goals. They are expected to
achieve the learning objectives through lectures, tutorials, small group
discussion, practical classes, clinical demonstrations, seminars, text
books and journal articles.

Medicine is a complex and demanding field of study in any part of
the world, Biochemistry knowledge is very important. Biochemistry
itself started as a component of Physiology in the Medical Faculty in
Colombo, Sri Lanka in the early 1900 and has now evolved as a
separate subject. Medical schools worldwide use different
methodologies in teaching which have been mainly in the form of
lectures with laboratory practical and tutorials to reinforce what has
been learnt [1]. Teaching medical students is a big investment of
institutes and the government and it considered as a personal
investment of time and money for an enrolled student [2]. Jacob and
Lefgren concluded as assessments of teachers' measures and the
quality of their teaching. The quality of teachers is assumed by their
effectiveness and ineffectiveness in classroom teaching which is
reflected through students' academic achievement [3]. The quality of
education is assumed by their effectiveness of transfer the knowledge
and ineffectiveness in classroom teaching which is reflected through
students’ academic achievement [4]. In this study the main objective
was to evaluate the teaching methods of Biochemistry for medical
undergraduates practiced in the newly built medical faculty at
University of Rajarata, Sri Lanka. The laboratory practical classes have
undergone changes to include problem-based learning, and tutorials
have been revised to include student seminars. In addition, panel
discussions and direct student-staff interactions have been used as
other learning teaching strategies. The primary objective of the present
study was to examine the preferred learning methods of medical
students and also to find out ways and means of improving lectures at
the Faculty of Medicine, University of Rajarata, Sri Lanka.

Lectures are conducted by the Head of the Department,
probationary lecturers and temporary lectures. The time allocated for
lectures is 50-55 minutes whilst for tutorials and practical classes it is 2
hours per class. Students must have more than 80% attendance for
tutorials, seminars and practical to be eligible to sit for the 2nd MBBS
examination. Seminars are conducted in the 3rd semester.
The whole course consists of 3 semesters that includes 15weeks. In
between there are 2 vacations. There are 3 mid semester formative
examinations conducted in semester I, II and III and two summative
examinations conducted at the end of the first and the second
semesters. The 2nd MBBS examination which is a bar examination is
held 4 weeks after the end of the 3rd semester. Performance in
Biochemistry is evaluated in terms of distinction, pass and failure. A

prize is offered for the best student in Biochemistry based on the
results obtained at the 2nd MBBS examination.

Materials and Method
The sample of this study consists of one hundred and seventy seven
students (96 males and 81 females). The sample included second year
students of the Faculty of Medicine and Allied Sciences, University of
Rajarata, Sri Lanka, which is located in Saliyapura, Anuradhapura, Sri
Lanka. All were enrolled in the medical education course. The faculty
is a socially and economically diverse community in Northern
Province of the country. It is the only medical faculty in that province
which was built in 2006. The students had followed Biochemistry and
sat for the selection examination (an examination conducted by the
Faculty for 2nd MBBS) after completing their 2-yr courses to qualify
for the final examination conducted by the Faculty. Two noncompulsory evaluating questions were administered with each of the

candidates when they were sitting for the 2nd MBBS Objective
Structured Practical Examination (OSPE) in Biochemistry at the
Medical Faculty, University of Rajarata. The OSPE was a walk around
type examination comprising of 40 questions of 3 minutes each. The
answer to the evaluating questions was deposited by the candidates
maintaining anonymity in the 2 boxes kept at the respective places.
There was on compulsion to answer the questions. The first question
was a fixed response question whilst the second was a free response
question. Care was taken to avoid any exchange of information or
ideas among students. To address the research questions likert scale
questions were used. We analysed our data as percentage of
application. For statistical analysis, all data was transformed using the
basic statistical analysis package.

Preference Order

Question 1: State the order of preference of the following teaching methods. Use a number 1 to 6 when stating preferences (1 being the highest
and 6 being the lowest).
Question 2: What recommendations would you make to improve
learning from lectures in Biochemistry?

Results
As per tabulated resulted in Table 1, the preference order of
teaching method include 1) lecture, 2) tutorials, 3) Student Staff
interaction, 4) panel discussion and the least preference was seminar
(Table 1). Out of the 177 candidates 93 answered the question one. In
spite of the deficiencies attributed to passive learning the students
appear to take a greater liking towards lectures. This probably reflects
the difficulties they may have encountered when gathering

information from text books written in English. This may perhaps
emphasize the importance of learning English in the Medical Faculty.
Tutorials are conducted in groups of 30 and moderated by the
lecturers. Questions, mainly data interpretation and problem solving
type are made available to the students few days before the date of the
tutorials. Students read the answers which are then subjected to
discussion and correction. This activity enables students to gain
experience in writing answers and also gain knowledge on different
approaches. A likely reason for choosing it as the 2nd preference may
be related to its help in making students to pass the examination
(Table 1).

Practical include tests to be carried out manually and problem base

students as there is lot of discussion which is continued even after the
classes ended. They are carried out as small group activities of 5-6
students per group. Student-staff interaction is one to one type

learning. This facility is not much used, expect to clarify doubts. When
students do come, mostly girls, they come in groups of 2-3. This may
indicate lack of confidence of students to meet their tutors,
individually. This may perhaps be related to the weakness of using
expression in English (Table 1).

Panel discussion is a new concept that was introduced, where panel
of lecturers discuss questions posted around 180 students. This is
usually done at the end of a semester and at the end of a programme.
The students bring questions, usually from past examinations and
tutorials for clarification and open discussion. Students are hesitant to
ask questions directly, but they submit questions anonymously. This
may be because they have a high level of apprehension. Seminars are
conducted by groups of 35 students on “hot topics” that are of local,
global and medical importance. This activity enhances leadership
training, team work, IT application and enables them to look at health
problems in a holistic way. The work carried out by students is not

duplicated in the teaching programme and is tested at the 2nd MBBS
examination conducted at the end of the programme. The rating given
by the students is the lowest. This is understandable as they are keen
on whether that whether learning activities that could make them and
pass the 2nd MBBS examination, which is a barrier (Table 1).
Second question was answered only by 41 students out of 177. This
question was focused on type of lectures, the preferred form of
learning according to the survey. The objective was to find ways of
improving learning from lectures. The suggestions offered by students
are listed in Table 2.

Discussion
Medicine is considered to be the longest and most stressful course
of undergraduate study [6]. Our result findings depict that still a high
percentage of students is more favourable towards old fashioned
lecture centred method [7]. There are various types of publications
during the same period describing the increased interest in medical
research on teaching [8]. Giving lecture notes is a debatable question.
Objectives of the different course modules are made available in the
library. It is possible for students to gather information on these prior
to attending lectures. However, because of deficiency of students in
understanding new terminology they may yet find it difficult. It may
be possible for the Department to give the references in a more specific
manner, such as books, chapters, and page numbering, etc. after each
objective. This could be implemented to a limited extent. Another
possible alternative could be to get the other lecturers of the
Department to attend lectures of the Professor and see how they could
improve their style of teaching. This could be done at the end of the
lecture. But due to time limitation of a lecture of 50 minutes this could
be done only as an MCQ type question and answer. It is worthwhile
applying this. Because of time limitation it is difficult this to carry out.
But an alternative approach will be to allow the student to write the
question if possible along with their e-mail address, which they wish to
ask on a white board in the Department or to drop in a post office type
box to be displayed outside the Department entrance. Slowing down
lectures could mean more lecture hours. This is limited by the number
of lecture hours available. But with the new curriculum this could be
done. Further, whatever to be done beyond the lecturing time could be
given as a reading assignment. It is the request of only one. But this
could be a concern of the silent majority. Improving common usage to
be thrown in between lectures to clarify and importance point may be
helpful in putting the students at ease. It should be noted that there are
Tamil medium students who also may need assistance. The only way
this issue could be dealt is by having close student-staff interactions,
especially in the self-study time allowed in the time table. There are

several limitations in the present study. Although teaching methods at
Department of Biochemistry have been evaluated in this study, this
could be a potential area of future research to uplift the quality of
teaching Biochemistry in this country.

Conclusions
There is an increasing number of teaching methods of medical
students. The various method of teaching doesn’t improve the quality
of producing doctors in this nation. Medical schools and staff should
strive to enhance the quality and quantity should be maintained by
selecting the best teaching methods. Therefore, we would like to
encourage medical schools to ensure proper information to be given
and to conduct teaching according to the tailor made system that
matches with students’ needs.
