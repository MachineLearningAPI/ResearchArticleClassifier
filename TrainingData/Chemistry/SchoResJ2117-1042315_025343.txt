Abstract
The separation of both the drugs was achieved on Inertsil ODS 3 column (100 × 4.6 mm, 5 µm) column using a mobile phase of diammonium hydrogen phosphate buffer solution (at pH 5.5): Methanol (70:30 v/v). The flow rate was 1.0 ml/min and detection was done at 254 nm. The retention time for metoprolol succinate was 6.91 min and chlorthalidone was 9.94 min. Metoprolol succinate and chlorthalidone showed a linear response in the concentration range of 50-300 µg/ml and 12.5-75 µg/ml, respectively. The correlation coefficients for metoprolol succinate and chlorthalidone were 0.9999 and 0.9998, respectively. The percentage recoveries obtained for metoprolol succinate and chlorthalidone ranges from 98.9 to 100.6% and 98.5to 99.2%, respectively. The results of analysis have been validated as per International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) guidelines. Validation results indicated that method shows satisfactory linearity, accuracy, precision, and ruggedness. The extremely low flow rate, simple mobile phase composition makes this method cost effective, rapid, and nontedious and can also be successfully employed for simultaneous estimation of both drugs in commercial products. Key Words: Chlorthalidone, high performance liquid chromatograph, metoprolol succinate

INTRODUCTION

Metoprolol succinate [Figure 1] is chemically,

1-(iso-propylamino)3[4'(2methoxyethyl)

phenoxy]2propanol. Metoprolol succinate is a

selective 1 receptor blocker which is used in several

cardiovascular diseases, especially hypertension. The

literature survey reveals that metoprolol succinate was

analyzed by the spectrophotometric, high performance

thin layer chromatography (HPTLC), and reverse phase

high performance liquid chromatography (RPHPLC)

methods.[18] Chlorthalidone [Figure 2] is chemically

(RS)-2-chloro-5-(1-hydroxy-3-oxo-2,3

dihydro-1H-

isoindol-1-yl)-benzene-1-sulfonamide. It is used as

thiazide diuretic drug that has antihypertensive action.

liquid chromatographymass spectrometry (LCMS) for detection of chlorthalidone in human serum and blood, few spectrophotometric methods, and HPLC methods for the quantitative estimation of chlorthalidone in bulk and pharmaceutical formulations.[912] Currently, most commonly prescribed medicines for cardiovascular diseases are statins and diuretics. The present drug combination has promising effect to control hypertension and other heart diseases. Literature review suggests no analytical methods reported for simultaneous analysis in combined form, and hence the following work was carried out.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) Reference standards of metoprolol succinate and chlorthalidone were received from Torrent Pharmaceuticals Ltd., Ahmedabad, Gujarat. Vinicor D tablets were obtained from IPCA Laboratories Ltd., Gujarat. Dose of metoprolol succinate was 50 mg and chlorthalidone was 12.5 mg in Vinicor D tablets. Acetonitrile (HPLC grade) used was purchased from Merck  (India) Ltd., Mumbai. Orthophosphoric

acid and sodium perchlorate were purchased from Spectrochem, India. RPHPLC was performed using Shimadzu HPLC system (LC 2010CHT, Shimadzu Corporation, Japan) equipped with quaternary pump, auto injector, column oven, and photodiode array (PDA) detector.
Chromatographic Condition
Column: Inerstil ODS 3 (4.6 × 100 mm), 5 µm. Detector: 254 nm Injection volume: 20 mL Flow rate: 1.0 mL/min Temperature: 30°C Run time: 14 min Mobile phase: Buffer (at pH 5.5):methanol (70:30) Diluent: Methanol as diluent 1 and mobile phase as diluent 2
Experimental Work Buffer Preparation
Accurately weighed 1.3 g diammonium hydrogen phosphate was dissolved into 1,000 mL milliq water and 10 ml triethylamine was added to this buffer solution, than pH was adjusted to 5.5 with orthophosphoric acid.
Preparation of Standard Solution Approximately 100 mg of metoprolol succinate and 25 mg of chlorthalidone reference standards were accurately weighed and transferred to a 200 ml volumetric flask. The weighed sample was dissolved in methanol and sonicated for 10 min. The weighed sample was made up to volume with methanol to produce a standard stock solution. Aliquots from the standard stock solutions were appropriately diluted to 25  ml with mobile phase to obtain final standard

concentration of metoprolol succinate (200 ppm) and chlorthalidone (50 ppm).
Preparation of Test Solution Twenty tablets were weighed accurately and finely powdered. Tablet powder equivalent to 500 mg of metoprolol succinate and 62.5 mg of chlorthalidone was transferred to a 500  ml volumetric flask. A  few milliliters of methanol were added to above flask and flask was sonicated for 30 min. The solution was made up to mark with same diluent. Appropriate volume of aliquot was transferred to 25 ml volumetric flask and volume was made up to mark with diluent to obtain final standard concentration of metoprolol succinate (200 ppm) and chlorthalidone (50 ppm). The test solution was filtered through 0.45 µm (Polyvinylidine fluoride (PVDF) Millipore Filter) and analyzed by using HPLC.
Method Optimization
The detection wavelength of 254 nm was chosen in order to achieve a good sensitivity for quantitative determination of metoprolol succinate and chlorthalidone in solid dosage form. The retention time for metoprolol succinate was 6.9 min and chlorthalidone was 9.9 min. The isocratic program throughout HPLC method was adopted to analyze both components in a single run as shown in [Figure 3].
Method Validation
Validation was carried out with respect to various parameters, as required under International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) guideline Q2 (R1). The developed method validated with respect to parameters such as linearity, precision, accuracy, specificity, ruggedness, robustness, and solution stability.[13]

Linearity
Appropriate aliquots of metoprolol succinate and chlorthalidone standard stock solutions were taken in different 25  ml volumetric flasks. The volume was made up to mark with mobile phase to yield solutions in final concentration range of 50-300 µg/mL for metoprolol succinate and 12.5-75 µg/mL for chlorthalidone. The solutions were analyzed by using HPLC. Calibration curve for both the drugs are shown in Figures 4 and 5. The results of linearity are presented in Table 2.
Precision
The method precision was done by preparing six different sample preparations by one analyst. The results are presented in Table 3. The results obtained were within 2% relative standard deviation (RSD).
Ruggedness
Ruggedness test was determined between different analyst, instrument, and column. The value of percentage RSD was below 2.0%, showed ruggedness of developed analytical method. The results are presented in Table 3.

Accuracy
The agreement between the theoretical added sample amount to the placebo and practically achieved sample amount from placebo has been employed for the determination of accuracy of analytical method. It was achieved at three different levels 50, 100, and 150% of the target concentration in triplicate. The results are presented in Table 4.
Solution Stability
The standard and sample solutions were found stable up to 24 h at room temperature.
Robustness
Robustness of the method was carried out by deliberately made small changes in the flow rate, pH, and organic phase ratio and column oven temperature. Results are presented in Table 5.
Limit of Detection and Limit of Quantitation
LOD is defined as the lowest concentration of an analyte that can be reliably differentiated from background levels. LOQ of an individual analytical procedure is the lowest amount of analyte that can be
