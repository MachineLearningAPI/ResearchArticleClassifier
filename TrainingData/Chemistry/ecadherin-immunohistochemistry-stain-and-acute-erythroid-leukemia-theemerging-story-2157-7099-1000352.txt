Abstract
E-Cadherin is calcium-dependent cell adhesion molecule encoded by CDH1 gene at chromosome 16q22.1. Ecadherin regulates cell-cell adhesions and controls mobility and proliferation of epithelial cells. Recently, the role of
E-cadherin in erythroid maturation has been elucidated. It is selectively expressed in immature erythroblasts and
gradually down regulated as erythroid precursors mature. Acute erythroid leukemia is neoplastic proliferation of
immature erythroid precursors in bone marrow with or without significant myeloblasts component. In the recent years
E-cadherin has emerged as the most sensitive and specific marker for immature erythroblasts. Moreover,
combination of E-cadherin with glycophorin A in immunohistochemistry staining can effectively separate immature
vs. mature erythroid precursors in bone marrow biopsy. In this short review I will shed light on the key points related
to the nature of relationship between E-cadherin and acute erythroid leukemia.

Introduction
E-cadherin
E-cadherin (epithelial cadherin) is a polypeptide protein belongs to
cadherins family whose primary function is to facilitate cell-cell
adhesion and recognition [1]. Cadherins are class-1 transmembrane
proteins named for "calcium-dependent adhesion" because they are
dependent on calcium (Ca2+) ions to function [2].
E-cadherin is encoded by CDH1 gene which is located on the long
(q) arm of chromosome 16 at position 22.1. [3] It is mainly expressed
on epithelial cells and behaves as both receptor and ligand for other
molecules and can be used as a marker for epithelial differentiation
owing to limited expression to the cells of epithelial origin. In addition
to that, E-cadherin has a major role in the morphogenesis of cells
during migration and acts as tumor suppressor gene [4,5]. In some
solid tumors, such as breast cancer, loss of E-cadherin function is often
associated with tumor progression and transition to more invasive
disease [6].

Acute erythroid leukemia (AEL)
AEL is a unique type of acute myeloid leukemia characterized by
proliferation of immature erythroid precursors (typically >50%) [7].
AEL is divided into two subtypes based on presence or absence of a
significant myeloid component: Erythroleukemia and pure erythroid
leukemia erythroleukemia (erythroid/myeloid) is characterized by
marked erythroid proliferation (≥ 50% of the entire BM cells)
accompanied with significant number of myeloblasts (≥ 20% of nonerythroid cells). Typically, the erythroid component is composed of all
stage of maturation with shift to immaturity and significant dysplastic
features such as megaloblastoid changes and multi nucleation. Pure

erythroid leukemia is neoplastic proliferation of proerythroblasts (the
early recognizable erythroid precursors) and other immature erythroid
precursors comprising at least 80% of bone marrow cells. Myeloblasts
are not detected in this subtype [7-9].
Erythroblasts express erythrocyte associated antigens; this
expression correlates with the degree of differentiation or maturation
of the neoplastic cells. Erythroblasts usually express CD71 (transferrin
receptor) hemoglobin A, glycophorin A, ABH blood group antigens,
and HLA-DR. Occasionally, expression of CD71 and glycophorin A
can be aberrantly dim or often negative especially in immature stages
of erythropoiesis. Erythroid precursors are classically negative for
myeloid associated antigens such as CD13, CD33, and MPO.
Immature markers such as CD34 and TDT are usually negative as well
[10-12].

The emerging story
In 1995, Sorin A et al. proved that E-cadherin plays a major role in
the maturation of the erythroid lineage [13]. This non anticipated
finding was confirmed by western blot (WB) analysis and
immunofluorescence staining of bone marrow samples. Dual color
flow cytometry revealed that the expression of E-cadherin is restricted
to immature erythroid precursor (pro-erythroblasts and basophilic
erythroblasts) while more mature erythroid precursors are negative.
Interestingly, Erythropoiesis was dramatically diminished when antiE-cadherin antibody was added to bone marrow culture .It is
postulated that E-cadherin has a major role in establishment of an
appropriate microenvironment necessary for erythroid maturation
[14].
The subsequent studies highlighted the significance of this finding
[15-17]. G Acs et al showed that E-cadherin was strongly expressed in
normal erythroid precursors of normal bone marrow specimens. In
contrast, erythroblasts in erthroleukemia (erythroid/myeloid
leukemia) lack membrane E-cadherin expression. However, the
majority of erythroleukemia cases expressed E-cadherin as a Golgi

distribution pattern, but not as cell surface pattern. Additionally, Ecadherin expression was stronger in more immature erythroid
precursors and down regulated during erythroid maturation [18].
In the research of Liu et al., E-cadherin showed weak-to strong
membrane reactivity in sheets of large, immature erythroblasts in 13 of
14 cases (93%) of pure erythroid leukemia, while Glycophorin A
stained mainly the mature erythroblasts but was weakly positive in the
immature erythroblasts (21%). The combination of E-cadherin with
glycophorin effectively separated immature vs. mature erythroid
precursors in bone marrow biopsy section. Moreover, the variability in
the staining pattern (Golgi vs. membranous) is demonstrated in
normal and abnormal erythroid precursors [19]. This variability
makes a distinction between immature and mature erythroid
precursors based on E-cadherin expression alone is a bet difficult.

infiltrating blasts were completely negative for Glycophorin A and all
other myeloid and lymphoid markers including CD41 and CD61.
CD36 and CD71 were partially positive. Interestingly, E-cadherin was
strongly expressed by almost all immature cells (≈ 95%) and was quite
helpful in pure erythroid leukemia diagnosis. This patient underwent
allogeneic stem cell transplantation but unfortunately, he relapsed
after 6 months with circulating erythroblasts and moderate bone
marrow fibrosis.
E-cadherin was moderately positive (≈ 40%) in immature erythroid
precursors. E-cadherin stain is a useful marker that more clearly
defines immature erythroid cells compared to glycophorin A [17].

Conclusion
The utility of E-cadherin stain as specific and sensitive marker for
erythroid differentiation has been elucidated in reasonable number of
cases. Moreover, it is useful marker that distinguishes pure erythroid
leukemia from other erythroid proliferation. Molecular studies,
preferably using high-throughput methods, are needed to clarify the
nature of the relationship between abnormal expression of E-cadherin
and tumorigenesis in acute erythroid leukemia.

In a unique study, Robert et al. examined 84 cases, including almost
all acute myeloid leukemia subtypes, in order to determine the
specificity of E-cadherin for leukemic blasts [14]. Of these 84 cases, six
showed significant positivity (>50%) for E-cadherin; 5 cases of acute
erythroid leukemia and one megakaryoblastic leukemia associated
with Down syndrome which was positive as well. Of the five cases of
acute erythroid leukemia, one case was pure erythroid leukemia (PEL)
and the rest were acute erythroid myeloid leukemia cases. The only
case which was positive for E-cadherin and did not belong to acute
erythroid leukemia expressed other markers of erythroid
differentiation such as glycophorin A. This case is likely to have
proliferation of both malignant erythroblasts and megakaryoblasts
however; no certain conclusion can be obtained.
Our local experience with E-cadherin is in agreement with the
published literature. We received 2 cases of pure erythroid leukemia in
the last 3 years. The first case was for middle age patient who
diagnosed with pure erythroid leukemia after long history of alcohol
abuse [20]. Immunohistochemistry for this case showed strong
positivity (≈ 80%) to E-cadherin (ECH-6; Ventana Medical Systems,
Inc., Roche, Basel, Switzerland), weak positivity (≈ 20%) for
glycophorin A (GA-R2; Ventana Medical Systems, Inc.) and negative
for CD34, MPO, vWF, CD3 and CD79a. In fact, the combination of Ecadherin with glycophorin A distinguished between immature and
mature erythroid precursors efficiently (Figure1).
The second case was for 21 year old patient who presented with
poorly differentiated blasts in peripheral blood and bone marrow. The
