Abstract
In computational chemistry or crystallography, we always meet the problem that requires distributing N particles in
one square unit with the minimal neighbor distance. Sometimes this problem is with special or complex constraints. This
short article will build a molecular optimization model for the problem, and then will show one example of the application
of this model.

Keywords: Computational chemistry; Crystal molecular structure;
Optimization model; Optimized Voronoi cells distribution
We consider the problem that requires distributing N (≥ 1)
particles in one three - dimensional (3D) 2a × 2b × 2c box/cell/unit
with the minimal neighborhood distance. Let us define that dij is the
direct-distance variable between particle i (1 ≤ i ≤ N) and particle j
(1 ≤ i ≤ N, j ≠ i). Direct-distance means particles i and j have a direct
interaction relationship, for example, in computational chemistry, the
van der Waals (vdW) contact [1], or solvent accessible surface area
(ASA) contact, etc. to each other. Denote (xi1, xi2, xi3) and (xj1, xj2, xj3) the
coordinates of particles i and j, respectively. Then, for the convenience
of practical computations [2,3], we can build an optimization model
for the above problem:
 N −1 N

min f(x)=  ∑ ∑ d ij 
 i = 1 j = i +1 

1,..., N

This might be a problem of Voronoi diagram and the unit is called
Voronoi cell. In computational chemistry, some crystals own special
structures of the Voronoi cells; in such a case, we may add some
additional constraints to Eq. (3). Clearly, the well-known Lennard-Jones
Clusters problem [4] is one case of the above optimization problem
Eqs. (1) ~ (3). Some computer-aided design models can be looked as
the problem Eqs. (1) ~ (3) [5,6,7]. Any optimization algorithms can be
used to solve Eqs. (1) ~ (3) but global optimization algorithms (e.g., in
[8]) are more preferred to use.
Example 1: We give a 2D Voronoi cells example (Figure 1). 2D is

a special case of 3D. We distribute 8 particles in one 2D square with
the minimal neighborhood distance among them, with a constraint
that each particle is only in one of the 8 Voronoi cells of the square.
Figure 1(a) shows the initial solution that is given to the problem.
Figure 1(b) and Figure 1(c) show the optimal (octagon) distribution of
the 8 particles inner the square and onto the boundary of the square,
respectively, after we solve the optimization problem Eqs. (1) ~ (3).
Example 2: We give a 3D Voronoi cells example (movies in [9]). The
Lennard-Jones clusters problem is clearly a 3D Voronoi cells problem.
Cameron et al. presented 4 movies to illuminate how the atoms to be
arranged and at last reach the minimal energy states [9].
