Editorial
Tuberculosis (TB), which is caused mainly by Mycobacterium
tuberculosis (MTB), is still a serious concern worldwide due to rising
number of drug resistance cases and HIV-TB co-infection [1]. In 2013,
over than 9 million new cases were diagnosed and around 1.5 million
deaths were caused by MTB infection. In 2010, it was estimated that
4% of new TB cases were multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) [2]. The
increased number of MDR-TB and extensively drug-resistance TB
(XDR-TB), adverse effects of available drugs and long-term therapy
justify the search for new safe and effective antitubercular drugs.
Since rifampicin discovery in the sixties, few advances were
reached in anti-TB therapy. Only in 2012, the United States Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) approved the drug bedaquiline to treat
MDR-TB. Despite this scary scenario, in the last years the number of
drug candidates to treat resistant TB has increased and compounds
such as OPC-67683, SQ-109, PA-824, LL-3858 are currently under
evaluation [3]. The success to identify new drug candidates is related
in part to screening campaigns performed by both academia and
pharmaceutical companies. Target-based assays and whole-cell
screening can be used during screening for antitubercular compounds.
The target-based strategy is a powerful tool that allows identifying
the mode of action of compounds. This strategy also contributes to
optimize the antimycobacterial activity of prototypes. However, the
main limitation of this strategy includes the need of target validation
since some biochemical pathway in MTB can be not essential in the
disease pathogenesis [4]. In addition, activation of alternative pathways
and efflux mechanisms present in the mycobacteria can decrease the
efficacy of this strategy. On the other hand, whole-cell screening has
shown to be a promising strategy to identify new antitubercular drug
candidates. Bedaquiline and compounds such as NITD-304 and NITD349 were discovered using this strategy. This phenotypic assay does not
require knowledge about the mode of action allowing the identification
of new chemical entities able to inhibit new targets or pathways in
MTB. Furthermore, this strategy is useful for prodrug’s identification
and it allows characterizing the selectivity of the compounds against
MTB. Since there is not information about the target, the optimization
of compounds using this strategy can be a hard task.
Nowadays, the combination of both strategies seems to be more
efficient to identify new chemical structures with different mechanism
of actions. In general, anti-mycobacterial activity is first identified
through phenotypic assay. After, techniques such as DNA microarrays,
gene knockdown and characterization of mutated genes of compoundresistant mutants contribute to the identification of probable targets.
The expression, purification and crystallization of these targets allow
optimizing the activity of those compounds in order to identify a
possible drug candidate [5].
Several potential targets have been identified in MTB using
combined strategies. Some examples include: a) DNA gyrase (gyrB
subunit) and topoisomerase I – both involved in DNA synthesis;
b) MbtA – involved in the iron metabolism of MTB; c) cytochrome
b subunit (QcrB) and type II NADH dehydrogenase – involved in

energy generation; d) decaprenylphosphoryl-β-D-ribose 20-epimerase
(DprE), fatty acid synthases (FASs) and polyketide synthases (PKSs)
involved in cell wall biosynthesis; e) Mycobacterial membrane protein
large (MmpL) – involved in transport of ions and organic compounds
through mycobacteria membrane; f) ClpP proteins (ClpP1 and ClpP2)
– involved in protein turnover [6].
During the last years, potent and selective antitubercular
compounds were identified. The compound 6-chloro-2-ethyl-N-(4(4-(4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenyl)piperidin-1yl)benzyl)imidazo [1,2-a]
pyridine-3-carboxamide (Q203), for example, acts by inhibition of
QcrB of the cytochrome bc1-aa3 complex. The MIC50 value against
M. tuberculosis H37Rv was found to be 2.7 nM. Furthermore, in vivo
studies revealed that infected mice treated with Q203 for 4 weeks (at
10 mg/Kg) have reduced the mycobacterial load at 99% in lungs [7].
Another example is the compound ((2R,3S,4R,5R)-5-(6-amino-2phenyl-9H-purin-9-yl)-3,4-dihydroxytetrahydrofuran-2-yl)methyl
(2-hydroxybenzoyl)sulfamate that demonstrated MIC99 value of 49nM
against M. tuberculosis H37Rv under iron deficient conditions. This
compound acts by inhibition of aryl acid adenylating enzyme (AAAE),
known as MbtA, involved in iron metabolism in MTB. The selectivity
index using Vero cells was characterized as being superior to 2000
for this chemical structure. Despite the potent in vitro activity this
molecule demonstrated inadequate pharmacokinetic profile with low
bioavailability and short halflife [8].
During screening using whole-cell assays the compound
1-((1r,3r,5r,7r)-adamantan-2-yl)-3-(2,3,4-trifluorophenyl)urea have
exhibited MIC value of 30 nM against M. tuberculosis (H37Rv) and
it also demonstrated activity against MDR strains [9]. Using genetic
approach, it was characterized through sequencing of resistant mutants
the MmpL3 as target for this molecule. Afterward, the optimization of
pharmacokinetic properties was performed in order to improve the
water solubility and reduce the lipophilicity [10]. Another example of
target identified after phenotypic assay occurred with the compound
1-(4-(tert-butyl)benzyl)-3-nitro-1H-1,2,4-triazole.
Using
highthroughput screening (HTS) approach the authors identified for this
molecule MIC value of 500 nM. They observed that resistant mutants
had presented a mutation in dprE1 gene and that the covalent inhibition
of DprE was the mode of action for this compound [11].

In summary, the development of a new platform driven by
phenotypic assays, genetic approach and target-based assays seems to
be promising to identify new potential targets and compounds active
against Mycobacterium tuberculosis resistant strains [12,13]. Despite
current advances in this field during the last years, challenges involving
the discovery of new drugs against latent tuberculosis are still distant
perspectives in the therapy.
