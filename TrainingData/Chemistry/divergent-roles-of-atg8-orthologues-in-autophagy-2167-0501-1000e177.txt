Divergent Roles of Atg8 Orthologues in Autophagy

Editorial
Autophagy is a fundamental pro-survival cellular process in
eukaryotic cells that recycles nutrients under starvation conditions.
Autophagy also plays a role in maintaining cellular homeostasis
by degrading damaged organelles or aberrantly folded proteins
[1-3]. During autophagy, a double membrane vesicle, termed an
autophagosome, takes up bulk cytoplasm and fuses with the lysosome
where its contents are degraded [4,5]. A key step in autophagosome
biogenesis is the lipidation of the Atg8 proteins by conjugation to
phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) on the autophagic membrane [6-8].
Although it has been found that genetic abolition of Atg8 lipidation
prevents completion of the autophagosome, the exact function of the
lipidation process remains largely unknown [9-13].
In mammalian cells, there are at least six Atg8 orthologues that can
be subdivided into the LC3 (light-chain 3) and the GABARAP (γ-amino
butyric acid receptor-associated protein) families. LC3s, comprised of
LC3A, LC3B, and LC3C, were first identified as microtubule-associated
proteins. GABARAPs, including GABARAP, GABARAPL1, and
GABARAPL2 (also known as GATE-16, Golgi-associated ATPase
enhancer of 16 kDa) were initially identified as intracellular trafficking
factors [14,15].
The Atg8 proteins are expressed universally although tissuespecific gene expression varies for the different homologues [15]. LC3C
is expressed primarily in the lung. GABARAP is expressed markedly
in the endocrine gland. GABARAPL1 and GABARAPL2 are expressed
primarily in the central nervous system [16]. The reason for this
divergence in tissue distribution is unknown. The Atg8 homologues
could potentially have a cell or tissue specific role beyond their
involvement in autophagy.
Extensive studies of LC3 lipidation in cell models have given
insight into how the process of lipidation is regulated. Stresses, such
as starvation, induce autophagosome biogenesis and LC3 lipidation.
Signaling factors, such as the mammalian target of rapamycin complex
1 (mTORC1) and the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), have
been implicated as upstream regulators of autophagy [17]. Starvation
leads to the inhibition of mTORC1 and the activation of AMPK,
which in turn activates the ULK1 kinase complex consisting of FIP200,
ULK1/2, ATG13, and ATG101 [18-21], and then the autophagic
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) complex including ATG14,
Beclin-1, P150, and VPS34 [19-22]. The former induces the assembly
of pre-autophagosomal structures by scaffolding and phosphorylation
of downstream factors and the latter catalyzes the formation of
phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate on the target membrane, which
is essential for the recruitment of downstream effectors. The two
kinase complexes direct the site of LC3 and regulate the magnitude of
lipidation [19-21].
LC3 lipidation relies on the ubiquitin-like conjugation systems for
the ATG12 protein and the LC3 protein [4]. These partially overlapping
systems serve to conjugate ATG12 to ATG5 in a reaction that requires
ATG7 and ATG10 and to conjugate LC3 to PE in a reaction that requires
ATG7, ATG3, and a protein complex consisting of the ATG12-ATG5
conjugate and ATG16 [4]. Studies have shown that LC3 lipidation is

dependent on the activity of the conjugation systems because lipidation
is completely eliminated in the absence of ATG5, ATG16, ATG3, or
ATG7 [9,11-13].
The lipidated form of the Atg8 protein is attached to both faces
(convex and concave) of the phagophore membrane, the cup-shape
precursor of the autophagosome [23,24]. Lipidation is a reversible
process since the cysteine protease Atg4, which is specific to the Atg8
proteins, de-conjugates Atg8 from the autophagic membrane by
hydrolyzing the bond between the C-terminal glycine of Atg8 and PE
[25,26]. Like the protein it interacts with, Atg4 has homologs and while
ATG4A is specific to the GABARAP family, ATG4B acts on both the
LC3 and the GABARAP families [16,27,28].
The exact role of Atg8 in autophagy, especially in the formation
of the autophagosome, has yet to be determined. Nonetheless, recent
studies have established that the Atg8 proteins have a dual role in
autophagy in regulating the growth of the autophagosome and in acting
as cargo adaptors in selective autophagy [16,29]. A study using an in
vitro system composed of purified proteins and liposomes indicated
that Atg8 lipidation causes membrane tethering and hemifusion activity
essential for the expansion of the autophagosome membrane, which
was later supported by a genetic study demonstrating the importance
of Atg8 for autophagosomal size [30]. A role for the Atg8 proteins in
cargo recruitment has also been proposed due to their binding to the
autophagic cargo adaptors P62, NBR1, NDP52, NCOA4, Optineurin,
and Alfy via the LC3-interacting motif (LIR) [16,31-37].
Although the Atg8 family proteins are homologous to each other,
they are not redundant. A study in which each of the Atg8 subfamilies
was selectively deleted has shown that the LC3 and GABARAP families
are both essential and act at different stages of autophagy. The removal
of one subfamily does not result in compensation by the other since
autophagy as a whole is inhibited [14]. In addition, overexpression
of LC3B in the absence of GABARAPL2 leads to accumulation of
the ATG12-ATG5/ATG16 complex whereas overexpression of
GABARAPL2 in the absence of LC3B leads to dissociation of the
ATG12-ATG5/ATG16 complex from the autophagic membrane
[14]. These results were consistent with the proposition that LC3s
are involved in the elongation of the autophagosome membrane and
that GABARAPs are involved later, possibly in regulating the sealing
process for the maturation of the autophagosome or in the fusion
between the autophagosome and lysosome.
A recent study confirms the role of GABARAPs in a late
step of autophagosome formation. GABARAP was identified in

binding phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase IIα (PI4KIIα) to generate
phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) from phosphatidylinositol
[38]. This step is crucial for the fusion of autophagosomes with
lysosomes since live cell imaging studies have shown that PI4KIIα
depletion inhibits fusion [38]. PI4KIIα does not bind LC3s indicating
that the Atg8 subfamilies have distinct roles. Further studies are
needed to elucidate the regulation of GABARAP, PI4KIIα, and PI4P in
autophagosome and lysosome fusion. It has been proposed that PI4P
may provide a platform for assembling the GABARAP scaffolding
network, which has been implicated in tethering, cargo recruitment,
and now fusion [38].
Although the LC3s have been proposed to act upstream of
GABARAPs in mammalian autophagy, a study of Atg8 proteins
conducted in C. elegans which undergoes allophagy, an autophagic
process, suggests a reversed role of the two Atg8 subfamilies [39]. The two
Atg8 orthologues in C. elegans, LGG-1 and LGG-2, correspond to the
GABARAP and LC3 families respectively. The study found that LGG-1
acts upstream of LGG-2 and is essential for autophagosome biogenesis
while LGG-2 mediates the tethering between autophagosomes and
lysosomes [39]. The question remains whether the functions of the
Atg8 proteins in nematodes are conserved in the human orthologs
since these results oppose the scheme that the LC3 family acts at an
earlier step than the GABARAP family in the autophagic pathway.
In addition to the association with downstream effectors, the
GABARAPs are also able to cooperate with early autophagic factors.
A study that investigated the interaction of the ULK1 complex with
the six ATG8 homologues found that ULK1 interacted most strongly
with GABARAP and GABARAPL1 although it interacted with
GABARAPL2, LC3A, LC3C, and weakly with LC3B [40]. Thus, the
ULK1 complex has a strong preference for the GABARAP family
and this interaction is mediated by LIR motifs on ULK1, ATG13, and
FIP200 [40]. The interaction of the ULK1 complex with GABARAPs
presumably facilitates or stabilizes association of the ULK1 complex
with the phagophore.
In summary, accumulating evidence indicates functional
divergence between members of the Atg8 orthologues in the aspects
of: 1) stages of autophagosome development, 2) autophagic factor
interaction, and 3) autophagic cargo selection. Still, the roles of each
Atg8 orthologue in autophagosome biogenesis as well as the roles of
each beyond autophagy have not yet been resolved. The emergence
of powerful genetic approaches such as CRISPR/Cas9 have made it
possible to dissect the individual role of each Atg8 orthologue [41,42].
In addition, super-resolution microscopy will allow us to determine the
details of Atg8 protein localization on a growing phagophore. Finally,
in vitro reconstitution approaches will enable us to resolve the detailed
molecular actions on the process of lipidation, cargo recognition, and
phagophore elongation.
