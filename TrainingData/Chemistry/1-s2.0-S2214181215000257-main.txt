An analytical methodology based on cloud point extraction (CPE) coupled to Ultra-Fast Liquid Chromatography and electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (UFLC-MS/MS) was developed for analysis of
Abacavir (ABC), Efavirenz (EFV), Lamivudine (3 TC) and Nelﬁnavir (NFV) in human plasma. It is the ﬁrst
time that CPE was used for extraction of antiretrovirals (ARV) from plasma. The effects of relevant physicchemical variables on analytical response of each ARV, including pH, surfactant concentration, equilibration time and temperature, were study and optimized; as well as its coupling to UFLC-ESI-MS/MS.
Under optimized conditions, the resulting methodology was as follows: a 500 mL aliquot of human
plasma was diluted with 2 mL deionized water in a 10 mL centrifuge tube. A 500 mL aliquot Triton X-114
5% w/v was added and homogenized using a vortex stirrer. The resulting cloudy solution was kept at
65  C for 20 min for promoting the condensation of surfactant micelles. Then it was centrifuged at
3000 Â g for 5 min for separation of the surfactant-rich phase. After discarding the aqueous supernatant,
400 mL ACN were added to the remaining surfactant rich phase and centrifuged in order to precipitate
proteins and separate them. A 150 mL aliquot of the supernatant was transferred to 2 mL vial and further
diluted with 400 mL deionized water. A 30 mL aliquot of the so-prepared solution was injected and
analyzed into the UFLC-MS/MS. The method detection limits for ABC, EFV, 3 TC and NFV under optimized
conditions were 31, 77, 57 and 21 ng mLÀ1, respectively. The RSD% for the studied analytes were <15%,
except at the LOQ, which were <19%. Recovery values ranged from 81 to 107%. The proposed methodology was successfully applied for the analysis of ABC, EFV, 3 TC and NFV in human plasma within the
concentration range of 43e6816, 125e4992, 81e3248 and 49e7904 ng mLÀ1, respectively. Under optimized working conditions the proposed analytical methodology meets standard requirements of international guidelines, which makes it suitable for pharmacokinetic studies of the four ARV, as well as for
therapeutic monitoring of HIV patients.

treat human immunodeﬁciency virus (HIV) infection [1]. Therapy
based on antiretroviral combination is used for patient treatment
infected with HIV. Accurate dose of ARV is essential in this kind of
therapy for guaranteeing viral suppression, as well as to avoid patient intoxication [2]. Additionally, reports show that patients
whose therapy is based on dose plasmatic ARV level, responded
better to it than individuals who followed a standard and/or ﬁxed
regimen [3]. Due to the complexity presented by the management
of patients infected with HIV, it seems clear that any way to
monitor the pharmacokinetics of ARV therapy could substantially

improve the design of the therapy protocol. To assess plasmatic
drug levels in ARV combination therapy it is important to count on
an analytical methodology for analyzing multi-components in a
single sample. Several methodologies were proposed for the analysis of ARV in plasma by using modern instrumental technique,
including liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray tandem
mass spectrometry detection (UFLCeMS/MS) [4e6]. As it is well
known, despite the outstanding sensitivity and selectivity of UFLCMS/MS, an exhaustive sample preparation is required for an
appropriated multiple ARV analysis; especially when they present
signiﬁcant differences on their physicochemical properties. This
fact, together with the sample volume limitation, the sample
preparation step turns to be a bottle neck for multiple ARV analysis
in biological samples for clinical studies [7].
Several sample preparation techniques have been reported for
extraction and isolation of ARV from plasma before chromatographic analysis. Although the most commonly reported is liquideliquid extraction (LLE) [8,9] and solid phase extraction (SPE)
[10,11]; they have as disadvantages to be laborious, to require a
large sample volume and to be time consuming. An additional
disadvantage of LLE is the use of signiﬁcant amount of volatile and
toxic organic solvents. Moreover, due to the low concentration of
ARV in plasma, large sample volumes are typically required to
ensure their detectability. In recent years, with the developing interest in miniaturization in analytical chemistry for solvent and
sample saving, some newer miniaturized approaches to LLE have
been reported. Several different types of liquid-phase microextraction (LPME) have been developed, including single drop
microextraction (SDME) [12], dispersive liquideliquid microextraction (DLLME) [13] and ultrasound assisted emulsiﬁcation
microextraction (USAEME) [14]. An alternative to the microextraction with traditional organic solvents is the cloud point
extraction technique (CPE) [14,15]. The micelles formation phenomenon is based on the aggregation of surfactants monomers
under speciﬁc physicochemical conditions, which result dispersed
into the sample bulk [16,17]. The resulting micelles provide a new
phase within the sample bulk with regions of diverse polarities that
enhance its potential for solubilizing solutes in a wide range of
polarities. The solutes afﬁnity depends on its nature and the surfactant structure. Hydrophobic solutes are solubilized in the inner
micellar core, polar/charged analytes are believed to be solubilized
in the polar region through a number of interactions (e.g. electrostatic, p-cation, hydrogen bonds, etc.), and amphiphilic solutes are
incorporated to the micelles through both hydrophobic and polar
interactions, forming mixed aggregates [15,16]. Thus, analytes can
be in-situ extracted into the micellar phase and selectively separated from the liquid sample bulk [18]. CPE has been successfully
applied for extraction of a wide range of analytes from biological
[15,19] and environmental media, including estrogens, vitamin A,
vitamin E [16], several kinds of proteins, as well as metal ions
[20,21] prior to liquid chromatography (LC) analysis. In addition to
the analytical advantages, standing out high separation efﬁciency,
selective isolation and wide range of ﬂexibility for coupling it to
different analytical instrumentation [11,21], it is important to
consider the operational advantages. In this sense CPE is low cost,
simple to operate and environmentally friendly because uses
alternative solvents such as surfactants, lowering the organic solvent consumption.
The aim of this work was to develop and validate a methodology
based on CPE coupled to ultra-performance liquid chromatography
and electrospray tandem mass spectrometry detection (UFLC-MS/
MS) for analysis of Abacavir (ABC), Efavirenz (EFV), Lamivudine
(3 TC) and Nelﬁnavir (NFV) in human plasma. Table 1 summarizes
the relevant physicochemical information of the studied ARV of this
work [23]. The effects of relevant physic-chemical variables on

analytical response of each ARV, including pH, surfactant concentration, equilibration time and temperature, were study and optimized; as well as its coupling to UFLC-ESI-MS/MS. The analytical
performance of the proposed method was evaluated in terms of
quantiﬁcation limits (LOQ), repeatability, reproducibility, accuracy,
recovery and linear working range. Moreover, the methodology
was applied for the determination of ABC, EFV, 3 TC and NFV in
human plasma samples of patients under treatment and its
robustness was evaluated in terms of recovery factors (RF%).
2. Experimental
2.1. Chemicals and reagents
Abacavir Sulfate (USP, LOT F1L487, 99.4% w/w), Efavirenz (USP,
LOT F0G376, 99.8% w/w), Lamivudine (USP, LOT H0I378, 99.7% w/
w), Nelﬁnavir Mesylate (USP, LOT F0K050, 98.3% w/w) and
Nelﬁnavir-d3 (Toronto Research Chemicals, LOT 4-SDJ-86-3, 98% w/
w) were supplied by the pharmaceutical industry. Stock solutions
(400 mg mLÀ1 of each ARV) were prepared by dissolving an
appropriate amount of each compound in acetonitrile (ACN).
Working solutions were prepared daily by dilution of the stock
solutions with ACN. Instrument tuning parameters were optimized
using 1000 ng mLÀ1 solutions of each compound prepared in mobile phase (10 mM ammonium acetate:ACN, 70:30 v/v). The Triton
X-114 (AppliChem, Germany) was prepared in deionized water
(DW-conductivity < 3 mS cmÀ1) within the range of 2.5e10% (w/v)
in DW. ACN and methanol (MeOH) were purchased from Carlo Erba,
France and Ammonium acetate (NH4Ac) was purchased from SigmaeAldrich, Germany. All reagents were analytic grade or above.
2.2. Instrumentation
The assay was carried out by using an ultra-performance chromatography coupled to a triple quadrupole (UFLCeMS/MS) instrument, described as follows: UFLC Shimadzu (LC 20AD),
automatic injector Shimadzu (SIL-20A XR), coupled to an electrospray ionization (ESI) source (Applied Biosystems, Ontario, Canada). Liquid chromatographic analysis was carried out on a Hypersil
Gold C18 column (100 mm Â 2.1 mm i.d., 3 mm particle, Thermo
Fisher Scientiﬁc, USA). Data were acquired and processed using
Analyst software (version 1.5.1; ABSciex, Toronto, Canada).
2.3. Sampling and sample conditioning
Samples were obtained from volunteers of DominguezLab,
which is developing a program for determining drugs bioequivalence (Protocol number: PRO-BEQ-EFV-001-V.01). Sampling was
carried out using a catheter system (BD Saf-T-Intima™, BD Vacutainer®) and syringes of 5 mL. The blood sample was collected into
heparinized polypropylene 4 mL tubes (NAHEP PLH 13X75 4.0 PLBL
GN, BD Vacutainer®, Broken Bow NE 68822 US) and centrifuged at
3000 rpm (1400 Â g) for plasma separation. Aliquots of 1 mL were
preserved in polypropylene 2 mL cryovials and frozen
at À20  C ± 5  C until analysis.
2.4. Cloud point extraction
A 500 mL aliquot of human plasma was diluted with 2 mL DW in
a 10 mL centrifuge tube. An aliquot of 500 mL Triton X-114 5% w/v
was added and homogenized using a vortex stirrer. The resulting
cloudy solution was kept at 65  C for 20 min for promoting the
condensation of surfactant micelles. Then it was centrifuged at
3000 Â g for 5 min for separation of the surfactant-rich phase. After
discarding the aqueous supernatant, 400 mL ACN were added to the

and analyzed into the UFLC-MS/MS.

3. Results and discussion
As it is well known, CPE efﬁciency is conditioned by physicochemical variables as well as the matrix nature of the sample and
analytes [14,18]. Therefore, it is of interest to study the effect of the
experimental physicochemical variables on the analytical response
of the ARV and optimize it towards achieving high sensitivity and
selectivity of the methodology.
Developing analytical method using synthetic solution and
further application on real samples generally requires severe adjustments. This could lead to a new method different from the
former one. The use of real matrix all along the process is a
convenient choice for characterizing, studying and optimizing the
analytical methodology that is been developed. In this sense, not
only the signal enhancing due to the improvement of the extraction
efﬁciency resulted signiﬁcant, but also the matrix load minimization, which led to a satisfactory chromatographic analysis. These
aspects were what ﬁnally determined the sensitivity and selectivity
of the resulting analytical methodology. Thus, those particular
factors of a real matrix, as well as all experimental variables that
condition the analytical responses of the ARV were evaluated,
including extraction pH, surfactant concentration, extraction time
and temperature, salting out effect and the use of modiﬁers,
including ACN, MeOH and acid, respectively. These studies were
carried out by modifying one variable at the time keeping constant
the remaining ones. A 500 mL aliquot of plasma, originally free of
ARV, was spiked with antiretroviral standard-mix (750 ng mLÀ1
3 TC and ABC, 300 ng mLÀ1 NFV and 150 ng mLÀ1 EFV in H2O:MeOH
75:25 v/v) and 50 mL of Nelﬁnavir-d3 (Internal Standard,
2200 ng mLÀ1) for carrying out the assays, which were done by
triplicate. The chromatographic peak area was used to evaluate the
impact of modiﬁed experimental conditions on the analytical
response.
From Section 3.2e3.5 are presented the results and discussion of
the relevant variables of this work. The remaining variables
mentioned above, did not show signiﬁcant effect on the analytical
response of the studied ARV.

3.1. UFLC-MS/MS conditions
In the present work, the MS optimization was carried out using
direct infusion of standard solutions of each ARV into de ESI source
of the mass spectrometer at 20 mL minÀ1 using a built-in syringe
pump. Base ion of each ARV was selected from full scan mode
recorded within the range 50e600 m/z. In all cases [MþH]þ mode
were selected. Declustering Potential (DP), Entrance Potential (EP)
and Collision Cell Entrance Potential (CEP) voltages were selected
according to the sensitivity of precursor base ions, whereas Collision energy (CE) and Collision Cell Exit Potential (CXP) were chosen
to give the maximum intensity of the obtained fragment base ion.
The remaining operative conditions were as follows: 250 ms dwell
time, 5500 V ion spray voltage, 20 psi nebulizer gas (GS1:N2), 20 psi
curtain gas, 7 psi collision gas (N2), 20 psi drying gas (GS2:N2),
500  C drying gas temperature and 100  C source temperature. The
mass spectrometer was used in the multiple reaction monitoring
(MRM) mode and the m/z transition for quantiﬁcation collected in
positive mode were 287.1 / 191.2, 316.0 / 168.2, 230.0 / 112.1,
568.4 / 330.1 and 571.4 / 333.1 for ABC, EFV, 3 TC, NFV and NFVd3, respectively.
The chromatographic separation was carried out using a mobile
phase of two components: A and B. A: 10 mM NH4Ac:ACN (70:30 v/
v) and B: 100% ACN. The ﬂow rate was set at 0.25 mL minÀ1 and the
column temperature was kept at 40  C along the run. The injection
volume was 30 mL and the run time was 4 min. The retention time
for the target analytes were 1.30, 1.34, 1.61 and 2.06 min for ABC,
3 TC, NFV and EFV, respectively. Representative chromatograms of a
standard mixture of the analytes are illustrated in Fig. 1.
3.2. Surfactant concentration
Triton X-114 is one of the nonionic surfactant extensively used
for CPE [24]. It has been successfully applied for extracting a wide
range of analytes from biological [15,19] and environmental samples, including estrogens, vitamin A, vitamin E [16], kinds of proteins, as well as metal ions [20,21]. Additional advantages include
commercial availability with high purity, low toxicity and low cost,
high density of the resulting surfactant reach phase facilitating the
phase separation by centrifugation, and relatively low coacervating
temperature [22].
Reports indicate that the amount of Triton X-114 not only
affected the extraction efﬁciency but also the resulting surfactantrich phase volume after phases separation [15]. The smaller the

initial surfactant concentration, the smaller is the resulting
surfactant-rich phase volume leading to higher sensitivity of the
methodology. However, it is well known that a small surfactantrich phase volume (<20 mL) leads to operative difﬁculties to efﬁciently separate it from the supernatant, which affect on the accuracy and reproducibility of the methodology [25].
Considering those aspects, four Triton X-114 concentrations
were assayed: 2.5%, 5.0%, 7.5% and 10.0% w/v. Higher concentrations
of surfactant were no assayed since it could affect the spectrometer
ion source performance, mainly by clog, which lead to signal loss.
The remaining steps were carried out as described in section 2.4.
Considering that different surfactant concentration would lead to
different surfactant reach phase volumes, it was referred to the
same ﬁnal volume (ca. 200 mL) with DW for all surfactant concentrations assayed in order to achieve comparable results. From Fig. 2,
it can be observe that the analytical response of ABC and 3 TC

increased as the surfactant concentration increases. For EFV, the
highest analytical response was achieved for the smaller surfactant
concentration assayed falling to ca. 30% at 10% w/v Triton X-114.
NFV reported its highest relative response at 5% w/v Triton X-114
falling to ca. 75% at 10% w/v Triton X-114.
These results could be attributed to the analytes physicalechemical properties inﬂuencing the extraction efﬁciency of the
CPE technique, and thus the analytical responses [26]. At the
working pH 3 TC and ABC were in their molecular form, while EFV
and NFV were in their ionic forms. They show different water solubility behavior (Table 1) coherent with their analytical responses. In
this sense, it is expected to obtain the lowest responses for 3 TC and
ABC since they are the most polar analytes and the surfactant is noionic, limiting thus the afﬁnity between them and the micelles. The
performance of EFV could be attributed to the fact that at the lowest
surfactant concentration assayed, the extraction efﬁciency was the
maximum. Higher concentration led to higher surfactant reach
phase volume; therefore, concentration of the extracted analytes
was lower due to a dilution effect. In this sense, NFV reported the
highest analytical response at intermediate concentration, falling for
dilution into the resulting coacervate phase when higher surfactant
was used. The most polar analytes contain higher number of polar
atoms into their structure. This leads to higher molecular effective
radio due to the solvatation, reducing their interaction with micelles.
Therefore, 3 TC and ABC require higher surfactant concentration to
achieve a successful extraction and analytical response.
Based on these experiment results, 5% (w/v) Triton X-114 was
adopted as working condition considering it as the best compromise concentration that lead to successful analytical response for
the studied ARV. This fact is relevant for the development of an
analytical methodology for a multi-component analysis.
3.3. Effect of pH
To the knowledge of the authors, CPE was not previously applied
for ARV extraction in any matrix; therefore there was no evidence

G.A. Hunzicker et al. / Analytical Chemistry Research 6 (2015) 1e8

of which could be the pH effect on analytical signal for this methodology. Analytical responses would be conditioned by CPE and
instrumental efﬁciency. CPE is strongly conditioned by physicochemical properties of the analytes, sample matrix, as well as CPE
particularities (surfactant type and concentration, matrix modiﬁers, etc). On the other hand, instrumental efﬁciency is also
conditioned by sample matrix characteristic and analytes physicochemical properties, additionally to the particularities of the
detection system. It is well know that plasma matrix contains dissolved proteins (6e8%) (i.e. albumins, globulins, and ﬁbrinogen),
À
glucose, clotting factors, electrolytes (Naþ, Ca2þ, Mg2þ, HCOÀ
3 , Cl ,
etc.), hormones and carbon dioxide [27,28] which could affect the
extraction efﬁciency of the CPE technique [29]. Considering that the
studied ARV are ionizable species according to their pKa (Table 1), it
was expected that extraction pH could affect their analytical responses as follows: the extraction pH may condition the ionizable
equilibrium of the ARV, and thus it molecular form, which affect
their afﬁnity for micelles, and consequently their extraction efﬁciency. On the other hand, it is important to highlight that due to
the nonionic character of the surfactant, it is not expected to see a
pH effect on micelles [16,17]. Considering this information, the effect of pH on the analytical response of ARV was analyzed. As
shown in Fig. 3, at pH 2.5 the lowest relative responses were obtained for all ARV (<50%). At this pH the analytes were in the molecular form, thus it was expected to have the highest afﬁnity for
nonionic micelles.
On the other hand, it was observed an inefﬁcient phase separation evidenced by on small volume of the surfactant rich phase
(<50 mL), which affected the extraction efﬁciency and consequently
their analytical response.
At pH 5 the resulting coacervate phase volume was ca. 450 mL
and showed turbid, which clear up after a protein precipitation
step. At this pH, 3 TC and ABC prevailed in ionic form, while NFV
and EFV prevailed in their nonionic form according to their pKa. On
this basis, it was expected to see lower relative responses for the
ionic analytes since they would have lower afﬁnity for the nonionic
micelle, and therefore, lower extraction efﬁciency for these ARV.
However, the analytical response of ARV reached their highest
values at pH 5 (>95%), except for NFV (ca. 70%), and remained
invariant only for EFV at higher pH values. These results could be
due to the tradeoff between the effect of afﬁnity of the analyte by
the micelles and their efﬁciency in forming, resulting in an
improvement of the analytical signal. NFV analytical responses
reached the highest values (>95%) at pH 9 and remained invariant
at pH 11.5. The analytical responses of 3 TC and ABC decreased from

pH 7 and pH 9, respectively. Phases separation was efﬁcient from
pH 7 ahead, obtaining a coacervate-phase volume of ca. 350 mL.
Coacervate phase showed the highest dehydration and the smaller
volume (ca. 300 mL) at pH of 11.5; resulting in a better phases
separation performance and reducing of the loss of coacervate
phase when the supernatant was discharged. The decrease in the
analytical signal of ABC and 3 TC at pH 11.5 could be due to a signal
suppression effect in the mass spectrometer because of a high
matrix load in the solvent front. Considering the short retention
time of ABC and 3 TC (1.30 and 1.34 minÀ1, respectively) it was
expected that their analytical signal were more affected by this
phenomenon than for NFV and EFV, whose retention time were
higher (1.61 and 2.06 minÀ1, respectively).
Based on these results, pH 7.5 was adopted as working condition
considering it as the best compromise pH that lead to successful
analytical response for the studied ARV. Considering that human
plasma pH is 7.4 [27], the extraction pH was not adjusted for CPE of
ARV from plasma. This fact is relevant for the development of an
analytical methodology for a multi-component analysis since it
simplify the procedure.
3.4. Optimization of extraction temperature and time
Reported cloud point temperatures for TritonX-114 are within
the range of 15e20  C [19]. It refers to the temperature at which the
surfactant coacervation results notorious in the extraction system,
because of its turbid aspect. As it is well known, extraction temperatures above the cloud point, and/or the extended extraction
time (>2 min), diminishes the water content of the resulting surfactant reach phase, and thus, its ﬁnal volume [25]. This argument
is based on the fact that as the extraction temperature increases,
the hydrogen bonds are disrupted leading, thus, to dehydration of
micelles [25]. On the other hand, it is important to take into account
that the use of excessive high extraction temperature can reduce
the CPE efﬁciency, because of the thermal stability of surfactant
aggregates [30] as well as the analytes lability. Therefore, it was of
interest to study the effect of the extraction temperature on the
extraction system performance, as well as on the analytes analytical
response along with the extraction time within the range 45e75  C
and 10e30 min, respectively. The extraction temperature assays
were carried out considering a 20 min extraction time; while the
time assays, were carried out at the optimum temperature resulting
from the former. As the temperature increased from 45 to 65  C a
better surfactant-rich phase separation as well as an increased
response of the analytes was observed. The results showed no
signiﬁcant change neither on the CPE performance nor on the
analytical response of the studied ARV at extraction temperatures
above 65  C. Therefore, 65  C were chosen for further assays. For the
extraction time, it was observed that by increasing it, the relative
response is subsequently increased, reaching the maximum
analytical responses of the studied ARV at 20 min; after which, and
remained invariant. Thus, in the following experiments, an
extraction time of 20 min was selected for the extraction.
3.5. Analytical performance and method validation
The proposed analytical multi-component method was evaluated in terms of linearity, recovery, accuracy and precision intraand inter-day, selectivity and sensitivity. Blank plasma was assessed
in six different batches of plasma samples by analyzing blanks and
spiked samples at LOQ levels. The calibration curves were made
under optimized conditions following the proposed methodology,
which was described above. Blank plasma were spiked with ARV
standards achieving different concentration levels [31,32]. No signiﬁcant chromatographic signals of endogenous ARV were

observed for any of the plasma batches at the target analytes
retention times.
The analytical ﬁgures of merits were summarized in Table 2. The
LOQ was deﬁned as the lowest concentration in the standard curve
that can be measured with acceptable accuracy and precision according to international requirements [31,32]. In this sense, the
criteria for evaluating the accuracy were as follows: relative error
(RE) value should be within 15% of the spiked value except at LOQ,
where it should not deviate by more than 20%. The regression
equations with a weighting factor of 1/x (where x ¼ concentration)
were judged to produce the best ﬁt for the concentration-detector
ratio response for all ARV in plasma [22,23]. The calibration curves
showed a satisfactory linearity within the concentration range:
43e6816 ng mLÀ1, 125e4992 ng mLÀ1, 81e3248 ng mLÀ1 and
49e7904 ng mLÀ1 for ABC, AFV, 3 TC and NFV, respectively. These
concentrations were chosen based on the expected pharmacokinetic studies of drugs containing these active values. Calibration
data was ﬁtted by using a 1/x curve resulting coefﬁcients of correlation (r2) > 0.99 for all analytes. The intra- and inter-day precision assay was evaluated over three replicates at three
concentration levels. The precision was evaluated over the sample
preparation step of the proposed methodology. The precision was
determined at each concentration level, and did not exceed 15% of
the percent relative standard deviation (%RSD) except for the LOQ,
which it did not exceed 20% of the RSD [31,32]. The resulting RSDs
values in the LOQ level ranged from 0.10 to 19%, and 1.0e15% for the
remaining concentration level. The stability of ARV in human
plasma after three freezeethaw cycles, short-term room stability
(6 h), post processing stability (12 h remain at the auto-sampler
temperature) and long-term stability (119 days at À20  C) were
evaluated. The ARV analyzed were considered to be stable in human plasma or extracts when accuracy was within ±15% (Table 3). A

typical chromatogram of spiked plasma sample is shown in Fig. 1.
The proposed methodology meets standards required by international guidelines for pharmacokinetic studies of drugs, as well as
for therapeutic monitoring of HIV patients. CPE technique resulted
efﬁcient, quick and easy to carry out the sample preparation for
ARV analysis in plasma by 4 min run UFLC-MS/MS.
4. Comparison of proposed CPE-UFLC-MS/MS with previously
reported analytical methodologies
The proposed methodology, CPE-UFLC-MS/MS, developed for
analyzing multiple ARV in plasma samples, presents several characteristics that makes it suitable for routine analysis. Table 4
summarizes analytical methodologies for analyzing ARV in
plasma samples. The ﬁgures of merit satisfy the requirements of
international guidelines so the analytical methodology is suitable
for bioequivalence studies. The resulting analytical ﬁgures of merits
(linear range, %RSD, recovery (%), and running time) are within the
values reported for other methodologies. It can be successfully
applied for analyzing four main ARV (ABC, EFV, 3 TC, and NFV) used
for HIV treatments in a reasonable running time (4 min). The
proposed technique, CPE, is suitable for batch preparations of
samples feasible to be carried out in 25 min with simple equipment
available in most of the laboratories. It does not include a solvent
evaporation step, neither requires toxic solvents, regularly used for
traditional techniques, like LLE and SPE.
5. Conclusion
This work presents a valuable contribution to analytical chemistry ﬁeld as well as those related disciplines including pharmacology, biochemistry and medicine, principally. A new application

Proposed methodology.

of the CPE for the analysis of ARV in human plasma by UFLC-MS/MS
was proposed for direct application in real studies. The CPE-UFLCMS/MS was developed on real matrices, which allowed a comprehensive characterization and optimization of the procedure with a
feasible validation according to international standards. The proposed analytical methodology was developed and applied for
analyzing of ABC, EFV, 3 TC and NFV in human plasma. Under
optimized working conditions the proposed analytical methodology meets standards requirements of international guidelines,
which makes it suitable for pharmacokinetic studies of four ARV, as
well as for therapeutic monitoring of HIV patients. Additionally to
its analytical performance, it is important to point out that the
proposed sample preparation technique has an environmentally
friendly character that makes it suitable for current green chemistry trends.
