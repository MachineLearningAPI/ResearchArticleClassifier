Abstract
Background: Lithium is used in prophylaxis of long term therapy of BPAD as a mood stabilizing agent. Thyroid
function abnormality is very commonly seen adverse effect, more common in females than males. This study aims to
correlate lithium levels and thyroid function abnormalities associated with it.
Methods and materials: Evaluation of medical records of 150 patients in Fr Muller Medical College with BPAD
who were treated for 6 months with lithium, Carried out from 12-02-2014 to 20-07-2014. S. lithium levels done by Ion
elective electrode method in ilyte analyzer and TFT by electrochemiluminescence. Data are analyzed by Karl Pearson
Correlation Coefficient.
Results: Correlation of lithium levels and TFT in BPAD patients according to Karl Pearson correlation co-efficient
was negative with significant p value of <0.002. Among 150 enrolled candidates 52 (34.67%) were females and 98
(65.4%) were males, 4% (6) patients (3males and 3 females) had TSH value <0.27 with an average lithium value of 1.35
mEq/l, 6% (9) patients (5 males and 4 females) had TSH value >4.2 with an average lithium levels of 0.44 mEq/l and
90% of the patients with an average lithium levels 0.66 mEq/l had no thyroid function abnormalities.
Conclusion: As already known lithium is a drug of narrow therapeutic index and females are more prone for thyroid
function abnormalities. Appropriate monitoring of serum lithium levels will aid in necessary dose adjustment and ensure
proper utilization of drug.

Introduction
Bipolar affective disorder (BPAD) also known as manic depressive
illness is a brain disorder that causes unusual shifts in mood, energy,
activity levels and the ability to carry out day to day tasks. Proper
treatment helps many people with bipolar disorder to gain better
control of their mood swings and related symptoms. People with
bipolar disorder are at higher risk for thyroid disease, migraine
headaches, heart disease, diabetes, obesity, and other physical illnesses
[1]. Bipolar disorder often appears in the late teens or early adult years.
At least half of all cases start before the age of 25 years [2].
Lithium, used in the prophylaxis of Bipolar affective disorder
reduces the severity and frequency of mania and also been shown to
reduce suicidal risk and short term mortality [3]. Inspite of its efficacy,
its use is associated with a number of short comings which include
narrow therapeutic index, cardiac toxicity, renal tubular dysfunction
and endocrinopathies like hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism,
hyperparathyroidism, hyperglycaemia and nephrogenic Diabetes
insipidus. It was also found that thyroid function abnormalities were
more common in females than males [4]. Lithium exerts its effects
through multiple mechanisms which include inositol depletion as a
consequence of which there is increased signaling within the cells [5],
induction of autophagy because of which there is degradation of cellular
proteins and organelles thus accounting for quality control function [6],
Inhibition of NMDA receptor mediated signaling [1,8,10], Inhibition
of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3), which is a proapoptotic and
regulator of inflammation and increases the β catenins which is
responsible for antiapoptosis of growth hormones [7]. Lithium is also
known to exert its action through BDNF up regulation [11].
Lithium preparations are available mainly as lithium carbonate
and lithium citrate as immediate and sustained release with a half-life
of 1-2 hrs and 4-5 hrs, respectively. Lithium initially is distributed in
the extracellular fluid, gradually gets accumulated in the tissues and
does not bind much to plasma proteins with a bioavailability of almost

100%. The concentration of lithium in CSF is approximately 40-50% of
the concentration in plasma. Lithium is a drug of narrow therapeutic
window with a therapeutic range of 0.5-1.3 mEq/l. It is potentially toxic
at doses >1.5 mEq/l. Blood for lithium levels should be drawn just prior
to the next dose or at least 6-12 hr after the last dose. It has been shown
in a retrospective study, that in recurrent depression, the 12 hour
lithium levels should be between 0.5-0.8 mEq/l and in mania, levels of
lithium between 0.9-1.4 is necessary for optimal results [8].
The normal functioning of the thyroid gland is affected by multiple
mechanisms of lithium. Lithium gets accumulated in the thyroid gland
and inhibits the synthesis and release of thyroid hormones probably
by affecting cellular microtubule function. Lithium also alters the
thyroglobulin structure and thus affects the function and protein
conformation which leads to coupling defects of iodotyrosine. Lithium
administration is associated with reduced hepatic de-iodination and
clearance of free T4 by decreasing the activity of 1-5`de-iodinase
enzyme. Lithium is also known to increase the propensity to thyroid
autoimmunity in individuals who are susceptible [9]. The mechanism
by which it exerts its mood stabilizing effects are still not clear. In this
study an attempt to correlate the lithium levels and thyroid function
abnormalities associated with it has been made.

Methods
The study was carried out from 01-03-2014 to 15-07-2014 for a
period of 5 months. Patients clinically diagnosed with bipolar affective
disorder on lithium between 18 yrs to 65 yrs of either sex were included
in the study. Patients who are previously diagnosed with thyroid
dysfunction and on treatment for the same and patients with serious
medical disorder endangering life were excluded from the study.
Data was collected from the department of Psychiatry, Father Muller
Medical College Hospital from patients clinically diagnosed to have
bipolar affective disorder. A sample size of 150 was studied. After a
written informed consent was taken both from the patient as well as
the patient`s relatives. Patients diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder who
did not have a thyroid abnormality or on any drugs which can alter
thyroid function at entry were evaluated. Serum lithium levels estimation
was done by Ion selective electrode method in ilyte analyzer and TFT by
electrochemiluminescence method. Data was analyzed by Karl Pearson
Correlation Coefficient, Chi square and Standard deviation.

Results
Correlation of lithium levels and TFT in BPAD patients according
to Karl Pearson correlation co-efficient was negative with significant
P value of <0.002. Among 150 enrolled candidates 52 (34.67%) were
females and 98 (65.4%) were males. 6 patients (3 males and 3 females)
had TSH value <0.27 with an average lithium value of 1.35 mEq/l.6%.
9 patients (5males and 4 females) had TSH value >4.2 with an average
lithium levels of 0.44 mEq/l . 90% of the patients with an average lithium
level 0.66 mEq/l had no thyroid function abnormalities (Table 1).

Discussion
In our study we found that at higher serum lithium levels in the
therapeutic window the most common thyroid abnormality seen was
hyperthyroidism, i.e., at serum lithium level of 1.35 ± 0.15 mEq/l.
Hypothyroidism was common at serum lithium levels of 0.44 ± 0.12
mEq/l and the patients with serum lithium values falling in between
these values were apparently normal with respect to their thyroid
function. T3 and T4 levels were not uniformly distributed because
of which we could not correlate their levels with serum lithium levels
(Figures 1-3).

population with normal TSH levels.

Perrild et al. and few other studies found that there is no gender
difference with regard to thyroid dysfunction.[12] Several other studies
have shown that there is higher incidence of lithium induced thyroid
abnormality in women [13,14] which is in agreement with our findings.
In cross sectional study by Kirov et al. among 115 males and 159
females with affective disorders on long term lithium therapy in the
UK, the prevalence of hypothyroidism was 10.3% [15]. Bocchetta et
al. in a study among 150 ambulatory Sardinian patients on lithium
therapy, no cases of clinical hypothyroidism was found. Subclinical
hypothyroidism was noted in 19% of the patients. Among lithium
treated patients with positive thyroid antibodies, the prevalence of
subclinical hypothyroidism increased to 53%. The prevalence of specific

anti-thyroid antibodies was positively correlated with age and duration
of lithium treatment, and was higher among women [16].
Bocchetta et al. and Chakrabarti concluded that risk of developing
lithium induced hypothyroidism has been shown to be significantly
higher among females, with increasing age (>50 years), presence of
family history of thyroid disease and thyroid auto-antibodies [17,18].
As the serum levels of lithium increases TSH levels decreases and
vice versa. Females on lithium therapy are more prone for thyroid

dysfunction hence the clinician must be more vigilant while treating
females with lithium. Further studies are required to establish the
particular thyroid dysfunction in correlation with serum lithium levels.
With the help of which, the clinicians can set stage for the anticipated
thyroid dysfunction.
