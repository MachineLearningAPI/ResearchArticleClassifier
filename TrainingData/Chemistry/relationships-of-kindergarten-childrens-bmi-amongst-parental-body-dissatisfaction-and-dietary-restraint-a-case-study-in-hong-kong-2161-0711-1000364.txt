Abstract
Objective: In this study, the aim was to explore the relationships of kindergarten children’s BMI amongst parental
factors such as parental BMI, body dissatisfaction, parental dietary restraint, child weight concern and child weightfocused restrictive feeding.
Method: 466 kindergarten students’ parents were participated in this study. A self-administrated questionnaire
was distributed to parents. Independent t-test, one way ANOVA and Pearson’s correlation were performed to
analyze the relationships amongst different factors contributing to children’s BMI.
Results: 30% parents and 37% children were found either overweight or obese. The six pathways in the
proposed model were all significantly correlated. It was found that parental BMI significantly correlated with body
dissatisfaction [r (466)=0.282, p<0.001], which was then associated strongly with parental dietary restraint [r
(466)=0.715, p<0.001] and weakly with child weight concern [r (466)=0.146, p=0.002]. The child weight-focused
restrictive feeding practice was moderately correlated with both parental dietary restraint [r (466)=0.360, p<0.001]
and child weight concern [r (466)=0.320, p<0.001], and then significantly correlated with child BMI [r (466)=0.121,
p=0.009].
Conclusion: The results of this study confirmed the presence of upward trend of childhood obesity in Hong
Kong. In addition, parental body dissatisfaction was found to be a significant factor to determine parental dietary
restraint, which was associated with child weight-focused restrictive feeding and finally affected child BMI.

Introduction
According to World Health Organization [1], childhood obesity has
become a crucial public health challenge in the 21st century, as it is
associated with the risk factors for cardiovascular diseases, like high
blood pressure or high cholesterol level. Over 60% overweight children
aged between 5 and 17 had at least one risk factor for cardiovascular
diseases and over 25% had 2 or more [2]. Obese child is found 80%
likely to remain obese in adulthood, together with increased risk of
morbidity and all-cause mortality, including chronic diseases like
coronary heart disease, hypertension, type II diabetes and certain types
of cancer [3]. The worldwide prevalence of childhood overweight and
obesity had dramatically increased from 4.2% in 1990 to 6.7% in 2010.
There were over 43 millions of children estimated to be overweight
and obese, as well as over 92 millions of children were at risk of
overweight in 2010. In Hong Kong, the prevalence of overweight and
obesity in primary school students had significantly increased as well,
from 16.4% in 1997 to 21.4% in 2010 [4]. It is foreseeable that the
trend will keep increasing and reach 9.1% or 60 million worldwide in
2020 [5]. Regarding the causes of obesity, increased adaption of
sedentary lifestyle and insufficient physical activities are the major
factors [6]; however, parental influence may also take a vital role to
childhood obesity.

Parental influence on child weight change
An early parent child interaction, like parenting and feeding styles
are found to be the crucial factors contributing to child weight
problems [7]. As parents are the one providing the child’s contextual
environment, it is believed that parents influence dietary practices of
child by controlling the availability and accessibility of food, as well as
the meal structure and eating pattern [8].

Parenting style
Parenting style is defined as the way of interaction with children, in
which would alter the effectiveness of parental child feeding practices
[9]. There are 4 types of parenting style, differing in the degree of
parental responsiveness and parental demandingness. Parental
responsiveness means the extent to which parents intentionally foster
individuality, self-regulation and self-assertion, while parental
demandingness is the demands and willingness of maturity,
disciplinary efforts and supervision on children [8]. Among these
types, Authoritative Parenting Style is characterized with high level of
both parental control and responsiveness to the child’s needs, while
Permissive Parenting Style and Neglectful Parenting Style are
characterized with low level demand and expectations on the children.
It is found that children under Authoritative Parenting Style has lower
risk of obesity, probably due to the demand of more healthy dietary

practice on children compared to Permissive and Neglectful parents
[10].

Child feeding practice
Child feeding practice aims to moderate children’s eating behaviors
by a number of behavior strategies, for example, modeling eating
behavior for both health and unhealthy food; determining the
availability and accessibility of both healthy and unhealthy food;
pressuring children for specific food choices; concerning about child’s
weight; restricting food intake; rewarding behavior, etc. [9]. Parents
are the buffer and filter for the child eating environments, it is believed
that child feeding practice may associate with the child weight status
[11].

Model linking maternal BMI and child BMI
According to the research conducted by Rodgers et al. [7], a model
has been proposed to determine the mechanism to predict the child
weight gain as shown in Figure 1. In this model, there were six
pathways being proposed in total, beginning with the relationship
between maternal BMI and body dissatisfaction, then body
dissatisfaction to both maternal dietary restraint and child weight
concern, followed with child weight-focused restrictive feeding and
child BMI change at last. Indirect relationships were obtained amongst
maternal BMI, body dissatisfaction and child weight concern,
however, the correlation between child weights-focused restrictive
feeding practice and child weight concern was found insignificant [7].

Figure 1: Model linking maternal BMI and child BMI change proposed by Rodgers et al. [7].

Pathway: BMI – body dissatisfaction
Body dissatisfaction is the negative thought of one’s own body,
which is developed with a kind of social comparison of body between
an ideal body and a current body size [8], including the judgment of
appearance, size, shape, weight etc. The association of body mass index
and body dissatisfaction had been consistently demonstrated in
researches [12-14], in which recent studies had also shown that the
increase in BMI can significantly predict the increase in body
dissatisfaction in the same period of time [7,13,15].

Pathway: Body dissatisfaction – dietary restraint
Body dissatisfaction was consistently found significantly associated
with dieting behaviors [16-18]. Unhealthy dieting behaviors, such as
fasting, purging, bingeing might even be developed, resulting in the
buildup of eating disorder. In several studies, it was found that body
dissatisfaction was consistently correlated with eating disorder in both
male and female [19-21]. Dietary Restraint is a type of dieting aiming
at weight reduction, as well as maintenance, by restriction of the types
and amount of food choice [22]. Correlation between body
dissatisfaction and dietary restraint was also found in some researches
[7,23].

Pathway: Body dissatisfaction – child weight concern
Apart from dietary restraint, parents with different degrees of body
dissatisfaction were found concerning child weight in a different
extent [24]. It was found that the concern of child weight increased
with the parental BMI, and hence the desire to control child weight. It
was believed that parents might implant their own attitude and
experience of eating during the feeding interaction with child, as well
as the preoccupation of weight and the feeling of body dissatisfaction
[25,26]. However, the relationship has not yet well understood as there
were some inconsistencies in researches, in which no significant
association was obtained with parental weight status [27].

Pathway: Maternal dietary restraint – Child Weight-Focused
Restrictive Feeding
Child weight-focused restrictive feeding is a feeding practice, in
which parents restrict the types and amount of food eaten by their
children for the purpose of weight reduction and maintenance of
health [28], in particular the snack food which is high in sugar, salt and
fat [24]. Parents, who were dissatisfied with their own body image and
might carry dietary restraint, were found associated with a higher
usage of child weight-focused restrictive feeding practice [24].

Pathway: Child weight concern – child weight-focused
restrictive feeding
Despite maternal dietary restraint, the usage of child weightfocused restrictive feeding was found to be contributed by the concern
of child weight. There were some researches showing that the concern
of child weight leaded to the desire to control child weight, therefore
positively associated with the use of child weight-focused restrictive
feeding practice [26,29]. In addition to the relationship, some of the
researches have proposed that the concern of child weight mentioned
in the association with child weight-focused restrictive feeding practice
was not the concern of the child actual BMI weight status, but instead
it was suggested to be the concern of the child becoming overweight or
obese [30,31].

Pathway: Child weight-focused restrictive feeding – child
BMI change
Child weight-focused restrictive feeding practice is supposed to aim
at maintaining healthy eating habits and hence controlling child
weight. Some researches proposed the association of restrictive feed
practice with decreased BMI, in particular in younger children aged 2
to 6 [32,33]. However, the effectiveness of restrictive feeding practice is
still in question due to the inconsistent findings.

In contrast to the above hypothesis, there were studies indicating
that child weight focused restrictive feeding practice not only failed to
control child weight, but also associated with the increase in their BMI
[28,34]. Consistent studies were found that the restriction would in
turn increase the child’s prevalence and consumption of restricted
food [28,35]. It was also proposed that the higher the level of
restrictive feeding, the higher is the tendency of overeating by child
[36]. It was found that restrictive feeding practice would promote the
child’s habit of eating due to desire, but not hunger.

The aim of this study was to explore the factors affecting
kindergarten child’s BMI in Hong Kong by application of the model
proposed by Rodgers et al. [7], such as the influence of parents own
body image perception, eating behavior on children weight concern
and type of feeding practice. In this study, the model [7] was slightly
modified by replacing the maternal BMI and maternal dietary restraint
by parental BMI and parental dietary restraint respectively as shown in
Figure 2. The major difference was that the target group shifted from
mothers to parents of child.

Materials and Methods

Parental BMI

Participants

Parental BMI was calculated with the self-reported height and
weight.

The current research was carried out during the 2013-2014
academic year. 11 kindergartens in Hong Kong were accepted our
invitation to participate in this study. 1860 questionnaires were
distributed with 609 questionnaires returned. The response rate was
around 33%. Finally, there were 466 questionnaires valid in total.

Procedures
All subjects participated voluntarily. Approval to conduct this study
was obtained from Hong Kong Council of Early Childhood Education
& Services. Ethical requirements for the collection of personal data of
the Institute of Vocational Education were strictly followed.
Questionnaires were distributed to parents of kindergarten students in
self-administered format through class teachers in February 2014.

Instruments
Questionnaire, consisting of 2 parts, was employed as a mean to
measure the behaviors of parents and students. The basic demographic
information of parents and child, like gender, age, height, weight,
educational level were asked in the first part; and the parental behavior
information was questioned in the second part. A pilot test was
conducted before the beginning of survey in Feb 2014 to ensure the
reliability and accuracy of questionnaire. The pilot test results were
fine and acceptable.

Components of the modified model
There were mainly 6 components in the model, consisting parental
BMI, body dissatisfaction, parental dietary restraint (PDR), child
weight concern (CWC), child weight focused–restrictive feeding
(CWFRF) and child BMI.

Body dissatisfaction
The five-item Weight Concern subscale of the Eating Disorders
Examination Questionnaire [37] had been found valid for assessing
body dissatisfaction [7]. Five items including importance of weight,
reaction to prescribed weighing, preoccupation with shape or weight,
dissatisfaction with weight and desire to lose weight were used to
assess the frequency of participants experiencing weight concern in the
past 28 days. An example item is “How dissatisfied have you been with
your weight?” All the items were answered in frequency scale from +1
(Never) to +7 (Always). The mean of body dissatisfaction was taken
for further analysis. In this part, the Cronbach’s α was 0.878.

Parents dietary restraint (PDR)
The frequency of parents engaging dietary restraint in the past 28
days was assessed with the five-item Restraint subscale of the Eating
Disorders Examination Questionnaire [37]. Five items including
restraint over eating, avoidance of eating, food avoidance, dietary rules
and empty stomach were assessed in the frequency scale from +1
(Never) to +7 (Always). An example item is “Have you had a definite
desire to have an empty stomach with the aim of influencing your
shape or weight?” The mean of dietary restraint was taken for further
analysis. The Cronbach’s α was 0.837 for this part.

Child weight concern (CWC)
Parental concern regarding the child weight was determined with
the three-item Concern Over Child Weight subscale of the Child
Feeding Questionnaire [38] using likert scale ranging from +1 (Not at
all concerned) to +7 (Always concerned). The subscale has been

demonstrated with good validity and consistency [7,34]. An example
item is “How concerned are you about your child having to diet to
maintain a desirable weight?” The mean of child weight concern was
taken for further analysis. The Cronbach’s α was 0.656 for this section.

Child weight-focused restrictive feeding (CWFRF)
A seven-item Restriction for Weight Control subscale was used to
figure out the degree of parents restriction on children to control child
weight from Comprehensive Feeding Practices Questionnaire [39],
with the likert scale ranging from +1 (Strongly disagree) to +7
(Strongly agree). Restriction subscale from the Comprehensive
Feeding Practices Questionnaire was chosen to use instead of the
Child Feeding Questionnaire Restriction subscale, not only because of
a higher level of internal reliability [7], but also the comprehensiveness
and ability to assess the restriction of all types of food. The subscale
has been shown to possess good internal reliability and convergent
validity in sample of children aged 2-8 years old [39]. An example item
is “I often put my child on a diet to control his/her weight.” The mean
of child weight-focused restrictive feeding was taken for further
analysis. The Cronbach’s α was 0.922 in this section.

Child BMI
The BMI obtained from child would be converted into groups with
the adjustment of age and gender according to the population growth
reference [40].

Statistical analysis
Statistical software, IBM SPSS Statistics 20, was used for conducting
statistical analysis, in which the components of the model were
presented with the mean score.

Results
Demographic results
A total of 466 subjects (parents of kindergarten students aged 3 to 6
years old) were investigated, in which 18.9% was male and 81.1% was
female. On average, mothers were 33 years old (SD=5.61) and fathers
were 39 years old (SD=10.28). Regarding education level, 27.8% and
44.7% of subjects were university graduates and high school graduates
respectively as shown in Table 1.

were classified as “Normal”, 16.1% as “overweight”, 9.9% as “obese”
and 4.1% as “Severely obese”, while the remaining 15.2% were

classified as “underweight”. In comparison with parents as in Table 3 it
was found that mothers have better weight control over fathers, as the
rate of male being classified as overweight was a double of female, and
even 4 times more in the category of obese.

Gender effect of modified model components’ score
An independent sample t-test was conducted to determine the
model component scores against gender. As stated in Table 6,
significant difference was found between fathers and mothers for the
component parental BMI, and CWC. First of all, the fathers’ BMI

(M=24.205, SD=3.86) was significantly higher than mothers’ BMI
(M=21.663, SD=5.42); p<0.001, 95% CI [1.31, 3.77]. For CWC, the
mean scores in mothers (M=4.693, SD=1.34) was also significantly
found to be higher than that in fathers (M=4.282, SD=1.30); p=0.011,
95% CI [0.09, 0.73].

Weight status effect of modified model components’ score

Body Dissatisfaction, it was found that the underweight group
(M=1.896, SD=1.07) was significantly less dissatisfied with their body
when compared to the overweight group (M=2.853, SD=1.36);
p<0.001, 95% CI [-0.84, 0.05], the obese group (M=2.817, SD=1.27);
p<0.001, 95% CI [-1.50, -0.41], as well as the severely obese group
(M=3.17, SD=1.71); p<0.001, 95% CI [-2.12, -0.42]. Moreover, it was
also found that the normal weight group (M=2.291, SD=1.05) was
significantly less dissatisfied with their body when compared with the
overweight group (M=2.853, SD=1.36); p=0.003, 95% CI [-0.99, -0.13],
the obese group (M=2.817, SD=1.27); p=0.05, 95% CI [-1.05, 0.0004],
as well as the severely obese group (M=3.17, SD=1.71); p=0.017, 95%
CI [-1.66, -0.10].
Similar relationship was obtained in model component PDR as well,
in which, the extent of PDR in underweight group (M=1.696,
SD=0.95) was significantly lower than that in the overweight group
(M=2.488, SD=1.09); p<0.001, 95% CI [-1.26, -0.33], the obese group
(M=2.570, SD=1.18); p<0.001, 95% CI [-1.41, -0.34], as well as the
severely obese group (M=2.495, SD=0.96); p=0.021, 95% CI [-1.53,
-0.07]. Moreover, the extent of PDR in the normal weight group
(M=2.055, SD=0.95) was significantly lower than that of the
overweight group (M=2.488, SD=1.09); p=0.10, 95% CI [-0.80, -0.06],
and the obese group (M=2.570, SD=1.18); p=0.14, 95% CI
[-0.97,-0.07].

One way ANOVA test was conducted to investigate the difference

Discussion
With the increased public concern of child obesity, early parent
child interaction was believed to be one of the crucial factors
contributing to child weight problems [7]. It had been investigated
with numerous studies to examine the relationships between parental
eating behaviors, body image perception and the transmission of
eating-related attitudes and behaviors to children [7,25,27]. As

influence of body image perception from parents, eating behavior on
children weight concern and feeding practice, and in turn on child
BMI has not been examined in Hong Kong, the model proposed by
Rodgers et al. [7] was adopted with some modifications in this study.
The association of parent-child interaction on child weight
problems among kindergarten period was investigated in this study as
it was believed that the younger the children, the stronger the effect of
parent child interaction would be associated. 466 participants

(parents) were studied in total with 18.9% male and 81.1% female, in
which 54.7% was found with normal weight, while 16.1% and 14%
were found to be overweight and obese. The rates of male being
overweight and obesity were found 2 and 4 times more than female
respectively. The result obtained was found similar to the prevalence
stated in the Health Facts of Hong Kong 2013, in which the percentage
of overweight and obesity of persons aged between 18 and 64 was
36.6% in total [41].
Besides, 11% and 25% kindergarten children were found to be
overweight and obese respectively. The percentages were found similar
in girls and boys. The total prevalence of overweight and obesity
obtained was found to be 36%, which was much higher than the figure
obtained in 2010 (21.4%) [4], indicating the presence of upward trend
of childhood obesity.
With reference to Table 7, parents who were well educated to
postgraduate level were found with lower degree of child weight
concern. It was assumed that people with a higher education level
would prefer contributing to the society more, therefore the high
workload would reduce their focus or concern on child.
Moreover, as expected, parents with a higher BMI would have a
higher level of body dissatisfaction as stated in Table 8, which was
consistent with previous researches showing the positive association
between BMI and body dissatisfaction [7,13,15]. Similar phenomena
were also observed in PDR. Parents categorized as overweight and
obese had a higher level of parental dietary restraint, probably due to
the increase in body dissatisfaction, leading to the development of
unhealthy eating behaviors, like fasting, food restraint, aiming at
weight reduction [17,18].
According to Table 9 and Figure 3, significant correlations were
identified in the six pathways of the modified model. To begin with,
parental BMI was found positively correlated with body dissatisfaction
[r (466)=0.282, p<0.001], which was consistent to previous research
[42]. However, the correlation obtained was comparatively weaker. It
was believed that parents, in particular female, had already adapted
and accepted the changes of body weight and body image caused by
pregnancy. Therefore, the expected stronger body dissatisfaction
might not be resulted due to limited postpartum period associating
with social thin-ideal body [42].
Regarding body dissatisfaction, a strong correlation was found with
dietary restraint [r (466)=0.715, p<0.001], indicating that people who
were dissatisfied with their own body were likely to achieve weight loss
in order to maintain healthy weight. Apart from PDR, a weak
correlation was obtained between body dissatisfaction and CWC [r
(466)=0.146, p=0.002] and consistency were found in line with
previous researches [25,26].
For the child-weight focused feed practice, moderate correlations
were resulted with PDR [r (466)=0.360, p<0.001] and CWC [r
(466)=0.320, p<0.001]. It was believed that during parent child
interaction, parents would choose the type of feeding practice
depending their own eating behavior and attitude. Therefore, those
with dietary restraint had a higher preference to use restrictive feeding
practice, in order to restrict their children from the food choice which
they were also restrained [24,28]. Moreover, as concerning about child
weight was not only a thought, it usually came with an action aiming
at weight control [26,29]. As a result, child weight-focused restrictive
feeding practice was used for purpose.

For the pathway between CWFRF practice and child BMI, a positive
correlation [r (466) = 0.121, p=0.009] was found to be in line with
pervious researches [28,34]. Some studies supported that the increase
in restrictive feeding might trigger child’s preference towards
restrictive food. It was revealed that the restriction of food enhanced
the child’s approach to those restrictive foods and the trend of child
emotional eating and eating in the absence of hunger [36]. Therefore,
overconsumption of food would be resulted and hence, calories intake
could not be controlled, or even increased with the restrictive feeding
practice [28].
Last but not least, our findings also suggested a new significant
pathway from PDR to child BMI [r (466)=0.100, p=0.031], which is in
line with certain studies [7,43]. It was revealed that individuals with
higher dietary restrained were more pleasant and desired to consume
restricted food due to the hyper-responsibility in reward-related brain
regions [44]. Therefore, it was believed that parents with behavior of
dietary restraint would use those restricted food, such as high calories,
high fat, high sugar food as rewards to children. As some studies
showing the association of increased risk of overweight with food
rewards [45], it was thought that child BMI would associate with
parental dietary restraint through food rewarding.

Conclusion
The results of this study further confirmed the presence of upward
trend of childhood obesity in Hong Kong. In addition, the mechanism
amongst parental BMI, body dissatisfaction, parental dietary restrain,
child weight concern on child feeding practice and in turn child BMI
has been examined by application of the model proposed by Rodgers
et al. [7]. As the model only explained 1.6% of the variance in child
BMI, it was weak in prediction of the BMI of kindergarten students in
Hong Kong. When considering the correlations amongst variables, it
was interesting to find a link between child BMI and parental body
dissatisfaction. Parental body dissatisfaction was found to be a
significant factor to determine parental dietary restraint, which was
associated with child weight-focused restrictive feeding and finally
affected child BMI. This link might be the result of increase of dietary
restraint leading to food rewards. Therefore, it is suggested that
programs should be given to parents to help addressing body
dissatisfaction and promoting healthy eating behaviors, together with
guidance regarding healthy feeding practice to help achieving the
children weight management.
Some limitations in the present study should be acknowledged.
First, the invitation list of kindergarten for this research does not cover
all kindergartens in Hong Kong, the results may be somewhat bias.
Second, all data were from self-report, which is subject to both random
and systematic bias.
