Abstract
Glutinone (1), coixol (2), friedelin (3), glutinol (4), and betulinic acid (5) were isolated from the plant Scoparia dulcis.
Their structures were identified using mass and 1D- and 2D- NMR techniques. All the compounds were tested for their
immunomodulatory potential in oxidative burst assay. Compound 1 showed a significant inhibitory effect on the release
of reactive oxygen species (ROS) from zymosan activated cells from whole blood (IC50 = 4.3 ± 0.6 µg/mL) as well as
from isolated PMNs (IC50 = 5.0 ± 0.3 µg/mL) as compared to standard drug ibuprofen in whole blood (IC50 = 11.2± 1.9 µg/
mL) and in isolated PMNs (IC50 = 2.5± 0.6 µg/mL) shows that it is more active in whole blood as compared with isolated
PMNs. Compound 1 when further tested for its effect on pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β and on nitric oxide
(NO), was found to moderately inhibiting the production of TNF-α (19%) at a concentration 25 µg/mL. On the other hand
a weak inhibitory effect of this compound was also observed on the production of IL-1β and NO production, whereas,
compounds 2-5 showed no effect (IC50 = >100) on the release of ROS from zymosan activated cells.

Introduction
The genus Scoparia belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae. The
genus comprises 32 species of flowering plants, native to Central Asia,
and also found in India, Nepal, Pakistan, Taiwan, Brazil, Nigeria,
and Nicaragua [1]. S. dulcis has been used in indigenous system of
medicine since hundreds of years [2]. Local and tribal people in Nepal,
India, and Pakistan have been using S. dulcis in the management of
diabetes [3]. Significant anti-hyperglycemic activity of aqueous extract
of S. dulcis has been reported earlier [3-5]. The plant has also been
used for treatment of stomach problem, hypertension, inflammation,
bronchitis, hemorrhoids, hepatosis, and as analgesic and antipyretic.
Many phytochemicals have reported from various parts of S. dulcis
contributing to the medicinal value of the plant [6]. Anti-inflammatory
activity of the 70 % ethanolic extract of S. dulcis on Carrageenaninduced paw edema in mice have been reported [7]. The antiinflammatory activity of water and ethanolic extracts of S. dulcis was
also reported in in vivo [8].
Immunomodulation with natural and synthetic agents for
the treatment of various chronic conditions, such as cancers,
atherosclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and diabetes and transplantation
rejection have the focus of major attention [9-12]. The cells of the
immune system communicate in a complex fashion. During an innate
immune response first line of defense is mediated by professional
phagocytes, including polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs),
monocytes, and macrophages. Upon activation, phagocytes migrate
to the site of inflammation, and produce various mediators, such as
chemokines, cytokines, and ROS to eradicate the infectious agents.
Phagocytosis is the elimination of pathogens through a process called
oxidative burst. Although normally it has a protective role, the over
expression of inflammatory mediators, such as ROS, NO and proinflammatory cytokines due to an in appropriate immune response can
cause damage to body tissues, and leads to various chronic illnesses.
Inhibitors of ROS, TNF-α, IL-1β, etc. are being used for the treatment
of various clinical conditions and compounds having capability to
modulate immune response and target the mediators of inflammation
with less toxicity have great therapeutic value [11,13].

In the present study, the immunomodulating potential of five
compounds, isolated from S. dulcis was investigated. During this study,
all isolated compounds were screened for the inhibition of oxidative
burst using luminol-induced chemiluminescence techniques. The
compound found to have promising effect in this assay, was further
studied for their effect on other parameters, including effect on proinflammatory cytokines, and nitric oxide.

Experimental
General experimental

Extraction and isolation of compounds

Collection of Cell Cultures, UK) were plated in 24-well tissue
culture plates. Cells were activated by adding 30 µg/mL of E. coli
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (DIFCO Laboratories Michigan, USA)
and treated with test compound at a concentration of 25µg/mL. The
supernatant was collected after 48 hours for analysis. Nitrites (a stable
product of nitric oxide) concentration in supernatant was measured
using the Griess reagent.

The shade dried whole plant of Scoparia dulcis (1.7 kg) was
extracted with 80% methanol water (4.0 L) for three times. The
concentrated methanolic extract (72.0 g) after evaporation of solvent
was then dissolved in distilled water (1.5 L). The aqueous layer was then
subjected to solvent-solvent extraction. First the aqueous layer was
extracted with n-hexanes (each 1.5 L volume of aqueous layer three
times with 1.5 L of n-hexanes). After evaporation of n-hexanes, 15.0 g
of the crude hexane fraction was obtained. The aqueous layer was then
extracted with CH2Cl2 and 2.0 g of crude CH2Cl2 fraction was obtained.
The aqueous layer was then extracted with ethyl acetate and 10.0 g
of crude ethyl acetate fraction was obtained. The dichloromethane
(DCM) fraction (2.0 g) was subjected to column chromatography in
order of increasing polarity of ethyl acetate in hexanes, which yielded
many sub-fractions. Out of them, sub-fraction B (800 mg) obtained
by 10% EtOAc/hexanes was further subjected to silica gel column
chromatography using 10% EtOAc/hexanes, as an eluting agent which
yielded compound 2 (45.0 mg). The hexanes fraction (15.0 g) was
eluted in column chromatography using silica gel with n- hexanes and
ethyl acetate. In order of increasing polarity of ethyl acetate in n-hexane
yielded five sub-fractions. The sub-fraction A (800 mg), obtained by
pure hexanes, was further subjected to column chromatography using
pure hexanes as eluting agent to obtain the pure compound 1 (40.0
mg). The sub-fraction B (750.0 mg), obtained by 5% EtOAc/hexanes,
was again subjected for column chromatography on silica gel using 5%
EtOAc/hexanes as eluting agent to obtain compounds 3 (35.0 mg), and
4 (50.0 mg). The sub-fraction E (900.0 mg), obtained from 30% EtOAc/
hexanes, was further subjected to column chromatography using 20%
EtOAc/hexanes to obtain compound 5 (50.0 mg).

Cytokine assay
Effect of compound on the release of pro-inflammatory
cytokines TNF-α and IL-1β was performed by method previously
described by [16]. Briefly THP-1 cells (European Collection of Cell
Cultures, UK) were differentiated by adding 20 ng/mL of phorbol
myristate acetate (PMA), (SERVA, Heidelberg, Germany) for 24
hours at 37ºC in 5% CO2 and then stimulated with 50 ng/mL E.
coli Lipopolysacchride B (DIFCO Laboratories, Michigan, USA).
25 µg/mL of test compound was then added for four hours, and
plate was incubated at 37ºC in 5% CO2. Cytokines quantification
in supernatants was performed using the human TNF-α and IL1β Duo Set (R and D Systems, Minneapolis, USA), according to
manufacturer’s instructions.

Toxicity assay
Cytotoxicity activity of compound 1 was evaluated on 3T3 cell
line by using the standard MTT (3-[4, 5-dimethylthiazole-2-yl]-2,
5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide) colorimetric assay according to
Mosmann T [17]. In this assay compound 1 showed no toxic effect
(IC50 = 200 μM).

Results and Discussion

Biological Activities

Compound 1 was isolated from hexane fraction of methanloic
extract of S. dulcis Linn. The EI-MS showed a [M+.] at m/z 424 and a
base peak at m/z 274. The molecular formula C30H40O, was deduced
from the HREI-MS which showed a [M+.] at m/z 424.3721 (calcd for
C30H40O = 424.3705) and the 13C-NMR spectra (BB and DEPT). The IR
spectrum indicated the presence of carbonyl (1706 cm-1), and olefinic
groups (1631 cm-1).

Determination of ROS by chemiluminescence assay
Oxidative burst studies using chemiluminescence technique was
performed as described by [14]. The assay was performed on whole
blood from healthy human volunteers and on isolated neutrophils
using luminol as a probe, and zymosan as an activator. Briefly 25 µL
of whole blood (1:20 dilution in HBSS++) [Sigma, St. Louis, USA] or
isolated neutrophils (1x106 cells/mL) were incubated with 25 µL of
different concentrations of compounds (1, 10 adnd 100 µg/mL) each
in triplicate in white half area 96 well plates [Costar, NY, USA]. The
plate was incubated at 37 ºC for 15 min in the thermostat chamber
of luminometer [Labsystems, Helsinki, Finland]. 25 µL of (7×10-5 M)
luminol [Research Organics, Cleveland, OH, USA], and 25 µL serum
opsonized zymosan (SOZ) (2 mg/mL) [Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland]
was then added into the wells Table 1. The plate was then read in
luminometer for 50 min, and results were recorded as total integral
readings as relative light units (RLU).

The 1H-NMR spectrum of 1 displayed singlets for protons of eight
methyl groups at δ 0.79 (H-25), 0.93 (H-29), 0.96 (H-30), 1.01 (H-26),
1.07 (H-27), 1.14 (H-28), 1.20 (H-23), and 1.22 (H-24). A downfield
signal at δ 5.6 br m was assigned to olefinic H-6. Position of double
bond between C-5/C-6 was inferred from the base peak at m/z 274 (EIMS) due to the retro Diels -Alder cleavage of the B ring, which was
further supported by the HMBC spectrum, in which H-23 and H-24
showed HMBC correlation with carbonyl C-3 (215.6) and olefinic
C-5 (142.4). Structure of the compound was further confirmed from
2D-NMR spectra (COSY, HSQC, HMBC, and NOESY). All the spectral
data of the compound 1 was unambiguously matched with reported
data in literature [18]. Structure of compounds, coixol (2), friedelin (3),
glutinol (4), and betulinic acid (5) were identified by comparing their
spectral data with reported data in literature [19-22].

Among all tested compounds, compound 1 (glutinone) (IC50 = 4.30
µg ⁄ mL) exerted potent inhibition of oxidative burst from whole blood
cells, whereas, remaining compounds showed no effect (IC50 > 100 µg
⁄ mL) (Figure 1). Compound 1 was also found to be a potent inhibitor
(IC50 = 5.0 µg/mL) of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), when
tested on zymosan activated isolated human PMNs using luminol as
probe. Cytotoxicity activity of compound 1 was evaluated on 3T3 cell
line by using the standard MTT assay was performed as described in
materials and methods. In this assay compound 1 showed no toxic
effect (IC50 = 200 μM) (data not shown).
Glutinone (1) was further studied for its effect on the production
of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-1β. In case of TNF-α,
moderate level of inhibition was observed (19%) at a concentration of
25 µg/mL compared to positive control. 1-100 µg/mL concentration
was used out of which, 25 µg/mL was seen effective for partial
inhibition TNF-α and IL-1β after a dose dependent treatment of
compound. Very weak inhibition was observed when it was tested for
IL-1β (3.3%). The standard drug used TNF-α inhibition is pentoxifillin
(IC50 = 98.4 µg/mL). Glutinone (1) was also evaluated for its effect on
nitric oxide production in cellular assay. Low level of inhibition was
observed (13%), when compared to standard L-NMMA (65.5%) at
concentration of 25 µg/mL.
Among all tested compounds, 1 was found to be the potent
inhibitor of ROS production. It also moderately inhibited TNF-α and
showed weak inhibition on IL-1β and NO. The anti-inflammatory
effect of compound 1 was reported earlier. Previously it was reported
to reduce inflammation in carrageenan induced rat paw oedema [23]
and found to inhibit protaglandlin E2 (PGE2) in mouse peritoneal
cells and thromboxane B2 (TXB2) in human platelets [24]. Present
study describes the potent suppressive effect of this compound
on myeloperoxidase dependent intracellular ROS production in
human PMNs. Luminol is used as a probe in this assay, as having a
low molecular weight it can cross the cell membrane, and hence can
detect both intra and extra cellular ROS, produced by the cells [25].
Previously reported anti-inflammatory activities of 1 are in agreement
with in current results as a reciprocal relationship between COX
and ROS. The mediators derived from ROS and prostanoids from
COX, such as PGE2, are well known in promoting inflammation and
enhancing pathogenesis of various inflammatory diseases including
cardiovascular disorders and hypertension [26]. The In vivo reduction
in inflammation in rat paw oedema by this compound [27] might be
due to its strong suppressive activity on derivatives of COX [24] and
in this study on ROS. Suppression of other inflammatory markers,
including pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β and on NO also
accounts for reduction in inflammation. Furthermore, this compound
found to be non-toxic when tested on mouse 3T3 fibroblast cells.
Most inflammatory conditions are associated with oxidative stress
and hyper activation of COX mediators. Current studies showed a strong
relationship between mediators of both pathways [26]. The compound like
glutinone (1) which have ability to block the mediators of both pathways
might be of therapeutic value against inflammatory diseases. However,
further studies to unrevealed exact underlying molecular mechanism, as
well as detailed in vivo studies and clinical trials are needed to evaluate the
effects of this compound in reducing inflammation.

Conclusion
Among all five tested natural compounds isolated from S.dulcis,
compound 1 (glutinone) exerted potent inhibition of oxidative burst
from whole blood cells whereas, remaining compounds showed no

oxygen species (ROS), when tested on zymosan activated isolated
human PMNS using luminol as probe. Compound 1 showed moderate
level of inhibition on the production of proinflammatory cytokines
TNF-α and IL-1β and weak inhibition was observed when it was
tested for IL-1β. Glutinone showed low level of inhibition for its effect
on nitric oxide production. Current study demonstrated the antiinflammatory potential of gultinone and it may be the lead compound
for further drug discovery process.
