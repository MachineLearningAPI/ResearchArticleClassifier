The calibration and quantitative measurement is the ‘‘Achilles heel’’ of the LIBS technique. This paper deals
with a method developed for the direct measurement of K and Mg in plant samples. Instrumental parameters were optimized and the best condition found was a 50 lm spot size, 10 Hz laser repetition rate, 75
accumulated laser pulses with 25 mJ/pulse and 0.25 ls of delay time. For method calibration, the use of
synthetic standard calibrating material prepared by the addition of increasing concentrations of K and Mg
in wood, ﬁlter paper and babassu mesocarp was proposed in order to assess the feasibility of using these
various matrices in plant samples analysis. The limits of detection of proposed method were 2–30 and 6–
27 lg gÀ1 for K and Mg, respectively. The use of the carbon emission wavelength at 247.856 nm was used
as internal standard to improve the analytical results. Certiﬁed reference materials of plants were used to
check the accuracy of the proposed method and recovery around 82% and 100% were obtained in all cases.

1. Introduction
Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) has become an
attractive and popular technique in the ﬁeld of chemical analysis.
In addition to the positive characteristics of solid sampling techniques, LIBS allows simultaneous multi-element determination
and in situ analysis, since portable instruments are available. For
all these reasons, LIBS has been considered a possible future ‘superstar’ of spectrometric techniques [1]. Despite all its advantages,
LIBS has some limitations: sensitivity and precision are poor since
a very low sample mass size is commonly used (<10 lg). A strong
matrix interference caused by the complex nature of the laser–
sample interaction processes is observed, which depends upon
both the laser characteristics, the sample material properties and
plasma–particle interaction processes [2]. For these reasons, quantitative analysis is not an easy task and has been considered the
‘‘Achilles heel’’ of the LIBS technique. Efforts have been made to
allow the application of LIBS for quantitative purposes.
One of the most important and difﬁcult issues in LIBS analysis is
the calibration; this is due to the non-availability of appropriate
solid standards and strong matrix effects. Calibration-free
laser-induced breakdown spectrometry (CF-LIBS) has been

developed to overcome the matrix interference. This approach
takes the matrix into account as a part of the analytical problem
and quantiﬁcation is performed considering the intensity of emission lines based on plasma properties, such as electronic density
and temperature. It has been successfully applied in the analysis
of metallic alloys [3] and other applications are still under
investigation.
Another possibility is the use of matrix-certiﬁed reference
materials (CRMs). There are more than 22,000 commercially available CRMs; however, materials of the same matrix containing different concentrations of the same analyte are practically
non-existent. Moreover, most of them are not homogeneous for
the sample mass size commonly practiced in LIBS analysis [4,5].
In considering this difﬁculty, many authors have proposed new
strategies for method calibration. Godoi et al. [6] proposed the
use of polymers spiked with Ba, Cd, Cr and Pb for the analysis of
toys, while Carvalho et al. [7] proposed the use of pharmaceutical
tablets mixed with a cellulose binder in different proportions to
perform the method calibration. To measure some elements in
wood samples, Chen et al. [8] spiked some wood pieces with a
metallic ions’ solution, and Trevizan et al. [9] used CRMs of
various matrices such as peach leaves, soy, rice and corn ﬂakes,
among others to calibrate the LIBS method for measurement of
micronutrients in plant samples. An interesting strategy for calibration proposed by Gomes et al. [10] involves the dilution of the

plant sample with its own blank produced after acid analyte
extraction. Filter paper spiked with increasing concentrations of
Cu and Zn has also been proposed previously as a synthetic calibrating material for direct plant analysis by solid sampling graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry (SS-GF AAS) [11].
The aim of this work is to evaluate the applicability of wood, ﬁlter paper and babassu mesocarp (Orbignya speciosa) spiked with
increasing concentrations of K and Mg as a calibrating material
for direct plant analysis by LIBS. To improve the precision of the
analytical results, the use of the carbon emission line as the internal standard is also proposed.
2. Experimental
2.1. Instrumentation
The measurements were performed with a commercial LIBS
system, model J 200 Tandem (Applied Spectra, CA, USA) with a
Q-switched Nd:YAG laser operating at 266 nm with a pulse energy
of 25 mJ per pulse and a high-resolution 6 channel-CCD spectrometer ranging from 186 to 1044 nm. The following emission lines
were evaluated (nm): K(I) (766.49 and 769.896) and Mg(II)
(279.553 and 280.27). The carbon emission line (nm) C(I)
247.856 was used as the internal standard. The intensity calibration of spectrometer was previously carried out by the manufacturer. The software Aurora (Applied Spectra, USA) was used to
evaluate the results. This software allows the monitoring of emission spectra, identiﬁcation of emissions peaks for elements, correction of background signal and integration of the atomic and ionic
emission peak area.
An iCAP 6300 Duo ICP optical emission spectrometer (Thermo
Fisher Scientiﬁc, Cambridge, England) equipped with Echelle polychromator, axially and radially viewed plasma, which was purged
with argon and had a simultaneous charge injection device (CID)
detector that allows measurements from 166.25 to 847.00 nm,
was used throughout as a comparative method. The introduction
system was composed of a cyclonic spray chamber and a
Meinhard nebulizer. The injector tube diameter of the torch was
2.0 mm. The instrumental parameters were: power 1350 W; auxiliary gas ﬂow 0.2 L minÀ1; nebulizer gas ﬂow 0.45 L minÀ1; coolant
gas ﬂow 15 L minÀ1; pump rate 25 mL minÀ1; and analytical wavelength (nm), K(I) = 769.896 (axial) and Mg(I) = 279.079 (axial).
A freeze-dryer (Thermo Electron Corporation) was used to dry
the samples and a cryogenic mill with a self-contained liquid nitrogen bath (MA 775 model, Marconi, Brazil) was used to grind them.
A pelletizer containing a 13 mm die set (X-Press 3635, Spex
SamplePrep, United Kingdom) was used to prepare the sample pellets. An analytical balance (Mettler Toledo, São Paulo, Brazil) was
used to weigh the samples. The samples’ acid decomposition was
carried out in a closed-vessel microwave oven (Speedwave 4,
Berghof, Germany).
2.2. Materials
High purity water provided by a Milli-Q water puriﬁcation system (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA), nitric acid and H2O2 (Merck,
Darmstadt, Germany) and analytical solutions containing
1000 mg LÀ1 of K (KCl) and Mg (MgCl2) from Merck were used.
Wood samples (pinus), pulverized babassu mesocarp (Esmeraldo
Produtos Naturais, Fortaleza, Brazil) and ﬁlter papers (Whatman
513, 15 mm) were used to establish the synthetic calibration standards by the spiking of increasing amounts of K and Mg, following
the sample preparation described in Section 2.3. Certiﬁed reference
materials (CRM) of plants (apple leaves SRM 1515, peach leaves
SRM 1547 and tomato leaves SRM 1573a) from National Institute

29

of Standards and Technology (NIST, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) were
used to check the accuracy of the proposed methods. All solutions
and samples were stored in decontaminated polypropylene bottles
(Nalge Company, Rochester, NY, USA).
2.3. Sample preparation
Wood and babassu mesocarp samples were cryogenically
ground during 14 min (seven cycles of 2 min grinding) after a
5 min pre-cooling step and with 1 min re-cooling step between
cycles. Five aliquots of 3.5 g of pulverized material were added into
the polypropylene bottles and spiked with increasing concentrations of K and Mg by the addition of 20.0 mL of the following analytical solution: blank (0.1 v/v HNO3); Solution 1 (875.0 mg LÀ1 of K
and 175.0 mg LÀ1 of Mg); Solution 2 (1312.5 mg LÀ1 of K
and 437.5 mg LÀ1 of Mg); Solution 3 (1750.0 mg LÀ1 of K and
875.0 mg LÀ1 of Mg); and Solution 4 (2187.5 mg LÀ1 of K and
1312.5 mg LÀ1 of Mg). The bottles were shaken for 30 min, and frozen and freeze-dried for 72 h. A homogenization step was carried
out in a cryogenic mill for 6 min (5 min of pre-cooling and 1 min
of re-cooling). For ﬁlter paper calibrating material, ﬁve ﬁlter papers
(around 1.2 g each) were used. Each paper was spiked with 0.8 mL
of reference solutions of K and Mg: blank (0.1 v/v HNO3);
Solution 1 (300.0 mg LÀ1 of K and 60.0 mg LÀ1 of Mg);
Solution 2 (450.0 mg LÀ1 of K and 150.0 mg LÀ1 of Mg); Solution
3 (600.0 mg LÀ1 of K and 300.0 mg LÀ1 of Mg); and Solution 4
(750.0 mg LÀ1 of K and 450.0 mg LÀ1 of Mg). Filter papers were
freeze-dried for 24 h and were cut into 1.0 cm2 pieces before grinding in a cryogenic mill for 34 min (5 min of pre-cooling and 1 min
of re-cooling). To check the concentration of the analytes in the
spiked matrices, they were acid digested (in triplicate) and analyzed by ICP OES. The acid decomposition in a closed-vessel microwave oven was carried out using a 0.2 g sample or CRMs and
diluted oxidant mixture containing 2.0 mL of nitric acid (65%,
v/v), 1.0 mL of hydrogen peroxide (30% v/v) and 3.0 mL deionized
water. The heating program was executed in three steps (temperature (°C), ramp (min), hold (min)) as follows: 1 (140, 5, 1), 2 (140,
4, 5) and 3 (200, 4, 10), using 725 W power and a maximum pressure of 50 bar. The ﬁnal volume was completed to 10.0 mL with
deionized water. Calibration curves for analysis by ICP OES were
made by successive dilutions of stock solutions containing
increasing amounts of K and Mg prepared in 20% (v/v) nitric acid.
The linear ranges were 0.5–300 mg LÀ1 for the K and Mg. The limit
of detection (LOD) of the ICP OES method was previously
calculated using the background equivalent concentration (BEC)
and the signal background ratio (SBR) according to IUPAC
recommendations [12]:

LOD ¼ 3 Â BEC Â RSD=100; BEC ¼ C rs =SBR;
SBR ¼ ðIrs À Iblank Þ=Iblank ;
where Crs is the concentration of the multi-elemental reference
solution (10 mg LÀ1), Irs and Iblank are the emission intensities for
the multi-elemental reference (10 mg LÀ1) and blank solutions,
and RSD is the relative standard deviation for ten consecutive measurements of a blank solution. The limits of quantiﬁcation (LOQ)
were calculated as 3.3 Â LOD.
2.4. LIBS instrumental optimization
The inﬂuence of the LIBS instrumental parameters on the analytical signal was checked using 13 mm wood pellets obtained by
pressing 0.5 g of pulverized material by 8 ton cmÀ2 for 5 min.
Spot size was checked from 35 to 140 lm, the laser repetition rate
from 5 to 20 Hz, laser energy from 5 to 25 mJ/pulse, accumulated
pulses from 5 to 200 and delay time from 0 to 0.4 ls. Sample

analysis was based on 30 analytical measurements per pellet. The
30 spectra obtained were separated into three replicates of 10
spectra (3 average spectra). For background (BG) correction, the
average BG intensity of the regions surrounding each selected
emission line was subtracted from the maximum intensity of each
selected emission peak. The LOD was estimated by 3 Â SD/a, where
SD is the standard deviation of 10 measurements of BG and a is the
slope of calibration curve. The LOQ was deﬁned as 3.3 Â LOD
[9,12]. The same regions of BG corrections were integrated to
obtain the signal to background ratio (SBR).
Wood, ﬁlter paper and babassu mesocarp spiked with increasing concentrations of K and Mg were used to calibrate the LIBS
method. Calibrations curves were made by using two different
approaches. The ﬁrst was based on monitoring the analyte emission intensity and the second on the ratio of the analyte emission
and carbon emission intensity.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Spiked calibration standard
To determine the concentration of K and Mg in spiked wood, ﬁlter paper and babassu mesocarp, the matrices were analyzed by
ICP OES after acid decomposition. The estimated LOQ were 188.6
and 1.8 lg gÀ1 for K and Mg, respectively. Mass fractions of these
analytes for the spiked materials are presented in Table 1. The
accuracy of the proposed method was checked by the analysis of
SRM 1515 and SRM 1537, which accorded a 95% conﬁdence level
when compared to the certiﬁed value (Table 1).

279.553 nm were used. The line C(I) 247.856 nm was also evaluated and the emission signal proﬁles are presented in Fig. 1. The
effect of the delay time was investigated using a spot size of
50 lm, a 10 Hz laser repetition rate and 75 accumulated laser
pulses at 25 mJ/pulse. The delay time was evaluated as being in
the range of 0–0.4 ls. Fig. 2 shows the effect of delay time on the
emission signal proﬁle, emission signal intensity and SBR for K
(Fig. 2a and c) and Mg (Fig. 2b and d) measurement. The increase
of delay time decreases the integrated area of the emission signal.
However, the emission continuum also decreases with the delay
time and, consequently, SBR increases. For Mg, a delay time higher
than 0.3 ls drastically increases the relative standard deviation
(RSD) since the intensity of the emission signal becomes weak.
Despite the higher delay time being the best alternative, 0.25 ls
was selected because a higher RSD was observed for Mg when
the delay time was higher than 0.3 ls.
The same investigation was carried out for C measurement,
which was used as the internal standard for K and Mg measurement. The use of internal standard calibration in LIBS is a good
alternative to minimizing the standard deviation of the results,
caused especially by the variations of the laser energy and by the
heterogeneity in the density of material [13], which changes
the amount of ablated material and consequently the precision of
the results. The use of C as an internal standard in wood analysis

3.2. LIBS instrumental optimization
The success of the LIBS analysis depends on the choice of best
emission wavelength and the use of ideal instrumental parameters.
The effect of spot size, laser repetition rate, laser energy, number of
laser pulses and delay time on the analytical results were checked
by the monitoring of an integrated area of atomic/ionic emission
peaks and the signal background ratio (SBR). Besides inﬂuence of
vertical distance above sample surface and pressure of surrounding
gas are also important instrumental parameters [15], the instrument used in this work does not allow their optimization. At least
two emission wavelengths were evaluated for each element; however, as their behavior was similar, only K(I) 766.49 and Mg(II)

by LIBS was previously proposed by Gething et al. [13] and Uhl
et al. [14], who used calibration by the increase of spiking concentration of Al, As, B, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, K, Mg, Na, Pb, Si and Sn in wood
samples. According to Uhl et al. [13], C is present in wood matrix in
a high mass fraction (approximately 50%) and the variation
between different types of wood is not signiﬁcant. The C(I)
247.856 nm emission wavelength was monitored as it was used
as an internal standard in this analysis.
The inﬂuence of spot size on the K and Mg emission signal was
also evaluated. This parameter was changed from 35 to 140 lm
and the integrated area of the emission signal and SBR were monitored. When a smaller spot size is used, the laser ﬂuence is higher
and, consequently, the excitation processes of the analytes are
favored. Considering the analyte emission intensity and standard
deviation of measurements, a spot size of 50 lm was chosen.
Energy per pulse was monitored from 5 to 25 mJ pulseÀ1 and
25 mJ pulseÀ1 was chosen because it presented the highest analyte
emission intensities. The laser repetition rate did not improve the
analyte signals; for this reason 10 Hz was adopted as the laser repetition rate. The last parameter investigated was the number of
laser pulses in each crater. Analyte emission intensities increased
linearly when laser pulse was improved from 5 to 75. Above 75
laser pulses, emission intensities decreased and standard relative
deviations of measurement also increased, which can be attributed
to the formation of deep craters that makes the delivery of emission radiation to the spectrometer difﬁcult.

3.3. Calibration of system LIBS
Calibration curve equations derived from spiked wood, ﬁlter
paper and babassu mesocarp with and without C as the internal
standard are presented in Table 3. In all cases, the use of the C
emission line as internal standard improved the calibration curve
correlation coefﬁcients, especially in the calibration curve obtained
with the spiked wood. Wood matrix is more susceptible to physical
interference observed in the non-homogeneous craters after laser
ablation, which resulted in the low precision of the results between

replicates. In the case of calibration made with ﬁlter paper and
babassu mesocarp no improvement was observed on correlation
coefﬁcient. The estimated LODs and LOQs obtained for each
method are also presented in Table 2.
There are differences between the slopes of the external calibration curves, indicating the presence of interference (Table 2). The
ratios between slopes of the calibration curves were calculated to
evaluate the degree of similarity between calibration curves made
with different matrices (Table 3). The closer the ratios are to 1, the
more similar the calibration curves are. In the absence of an internal standard, the ratios between slopes are close to 2, indicating
that spiked ﬁlter paper or spiked babassu mesocarp cannot be used
in wood analysis. Due to this kind of interference, most relevant
papers [10,15–17] have used the LIBS method of calibration using
a sample matrix spiked with an increasing concentration of analytes or dilution using appropriate materials. These results are in
accordance to Sun et al. [18] which proposed the measurement
of Mn, Zn, P, Fe and Cu in plant materials by LIBS. Besides accurate
and precise results were found when CRMs were used to make the
calibration, the authors observed matrix interference when cellulose was used to make the standard dilution. An interesting alternative is the use of C as internal standard, which allows similar
behaviors between different matrices to be achieved. The use of
C emission line as internal standard in calibration curves obtained
using spiked wood, ﬁlter paper and babassu mesocarp gave ratios
between the slopes close to 1, suggesting that C corrected the
interference, probably the ablation process, making possible the
use of spiked ﬁlter paper or babassu mesocarp as a calibrating
material for wood analysis or vice versa.
3.4. Quantitative analysis in CRM
To check the accuracy of the proposed method for K and Mg
quantitative measurement, three different plant CRMs were

analyzed. The use of spiked wood as a calibrating standard allows
quantitative measurement, even in the absence of an internal
standard (Table 4). When ﬁlter paper or babassu mesocarp was
used as calibrating standard, a recovery of 63–89% and 39–63%
were observed for K and Mg, respectively. However, when C
was used as internal standard, the recovery was improved to
86–106% for K and 78–100% for Mg, indicating these calibrating
materials could be used for direct K and Mg measurement in
plant samples.

4. Conclusion
Calibration and quantitative measurement is a difﬁcult task
with LIBS analysis. This paper identiﬁes a useful approach, which
is direct quantitative K and Mg measurement in plant samples by
LIBS. Instead of analyte addition to the sample matrix to make
the calibration, we propose a variety of calibrating standards by
spiking of increasing concentrations of K and Mg into wood, ﬁlter
paper or babassu mesocarp to be used as calibrating material in
LIBS. The use of C as the internal standard was imperative since
it corrected the interferences, which were probably the differences
of the ablation process between matrices. Choosing the best emission wavelengths, which were K(I) 766.490 and 769.896 nm, Mg(II)
279.553 and 280.270 nm and C(I) 247.856 nm, for use in the quantitative measurement associated with the optimization of the
instrumental parameters was decisive in allowing the analyte
quantiﬁcation.
This is an initial investigation of the production of a synthetic
calibrating standard for direct solid sampling microanalysis. The
preliminary study suggests this material can be employed in other
solid sampling analytical methods such as LA-ICP-MS, LA-ICP OES
or in other analytes and matrices; our intention is to apply these
in the near future.
