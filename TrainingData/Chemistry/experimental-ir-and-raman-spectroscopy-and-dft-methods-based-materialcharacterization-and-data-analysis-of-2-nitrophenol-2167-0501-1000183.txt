Abstract
Vibrational characteristics of 2- nitrophenol have been investigated using experimental IR and Raman data and
computational data using DFT method employing the 6-311++G** basis set available on Gaussian-09 software for
the most stableconformer C-1. Complete vibrational assignments of the experimental IR and Raman bands have
been proposed in light of the results obtained from the DFT computations and the PEDs computed using GAR2PED
software. The optimized geometrical parameters suggest that the overall symmetry of the most stablemolecule is Cs.
The molecule is expected to have three conformers. In the present article all the characterizations and the analyses of
the lowest energy conformer of 2-NP have been studied. The charge transfer occurring in the molecule has been shown
by HOMO–LUMO energy orbitals the energy gap of HOMO LUMO orbitals have been found 4.03eV. The mappings of
electron density iso-surface with the electrostatic potential (ESP), has been carried out to get the information about the
size, shape, charge density distribution and site of chemical reactivity of 2-NP. Current density and magnetic shielding
of C-1 have been investigated. Some essential thermo molecular characteristics, namely, enthalpy, Gibb’s free energy,
thermal energy, entropy, heat capacity, internal energy and the partition functions of the molecule have also been
analyzed.

Introduction
Nitro phenols constitute a class of volatile organic compounds that
is increasingly presented in urban as well as in natural environments
[1-3]. These are important and versatile compounds in the industrial,
agricultural and defence applications [4] and are frequently used as
intermediates in the manufacture of explosives, pharmaceuticals,
pesticides, pigments, dyes, rubber chemicals, lumber preservatives,
photographic chemicals, etc. [5-8]. 2- Nitro-phenols (2-NP), in
particular, poses significant health risks since it is a toxic to mammals,
microorganisms and anaerobic bacteria. Its toxicity is thought to be
due to the nitro group being easily reduced by the enzymes into nitro
anion radical, nitroso and hydroxylamine derivatives [4]. Although
extensive experimental and theoretical studies are reported on the
structural and vibrational studies of mono-substituted phenols [9,10]
dealing with their structural features, intra-molecular H-bonding
parameters and the vibrational spectra [11-14], only few works of this
kind exist on phenols [15-18]. In the present study we report the results
of our probing into the application of the DFT based SQM method
[19] to the vibrational analysis of hydrogen bonded systems. The main
difficulty in such investigations is that the vibrational spectra of these
compounds have not been completely analyzed even now and generally
only rough assignments are available. Therefore, an investigation of
the performance of the DFT-based SQM method has to be carried out
simultaneously with a complete vibrational analysis of the molecule.
This process was done successfully in the case of 2 6-difluorophenol
earlier [20].
The 2-NP molecule, contains a strong intra-molecular (O)
H......O(N) hydrogen bonding interaction which has been analyzed
by various experimental and theoretical studies [21-31]. The extensive
investigations corresponding to the vibrational description of 2-NP is
not complete. Most of the numerous spectroscopic studies [24,31-33]
focused on the vibrations from which the information can be carried
out about the hydrogen bonding interaction, first of all on the OH
stretching and OH torsion.

In the present work calculations have been made for the optimized
molecular geometries, APT and Mulliken atomic charges and the
fundamental vibrational wave numbers along with their intensities in
the IR spectrum, Raman activities and the depolarization ratios of the
Raman lines using the DFT (B3LYP) method employing the 6-311++G**
basis set [34-38] available with Gaussian-09 software [39] for the lowest
energy conformer C-1 of 2- NP. The experimental IR and Raman spectral
data have been analyzed in the light of the computed fundamentals and
the corresponding PEDs calculated, using the GAR2PED software [40].
For the calculation of the PEDs the vibrational problem was set up in
terms of the internal coordinates for the GAR2PED software. HOMOLUMO, total density plots, electrostatic potential (ESP) surface and
their arrays have been investigated. The essential NLO as well as thermo
molecular parameters have been investigated and using NMR analysis
employing Continuous Set of Gauge Transformation (CSGT) method
electro-magnetic characteristics of 2-NP have been investigated.

sample sandwiched between quartz cover slip and borosilicate glass
slide. The sample was mounted on the microscope stage and a 60X
microscope objective have been used to focus the laser beam and to
record the Raman signals. A liquid Nitrogen cooled Symphony CCD
detector have been utilized to collect the Raman scattered radiation.
The spectral range of the micro-Raman have been kept 200-3100 cm-1
with resolution 5 cm-1, accuracy 2 cm-1 at spectrometer slit width 100
µm. In order to record a better Raman spectrum, data were obtained
using a laser power of 47mW with the acquisition times of 5 min.
FTIR spectrum of 2-NP sample was recorded using KBr pellet.
The 10 mg of the 2-NP sample was weighed and properly mixed with
990 mg KBr. This mixture was then pelleted using KBr pellet maker by
applying pressure using 8 tons weight for half an hour. FTIR spectrum
was recorded using the above mentioned pellet at room temperature,
using an FTIR spectrometer (Jasco 6300) with a standard source. The
spectra have been recorded in the range of 400- 4000 cm-1. The 200
scans have been taken with 2 cm-1 spectral resolution for all the three
samples.

Computational Details
To optimize the structure of 2- NP the following procedure was
adopted. Initially the benzene ring (including H atoms only) was
optimized. After this an OH group was added to a carbon atom of
benzene ring and the structure was optimized. With this structure a
nitro group was added to the ortho position of phenolic group (Figure 1).
This structure was further optimized. In the optimized structure
if hydrogen atom of the OH group faces the NO2 group the structure
remains planar. However, if the hydrogen atom of the OH group is
kept away from the NO2 group there are two possible conformers of
2-NP, in one conformer the plane of NO2 makes the angle -33.70 while
in the other it makes an angle of 33.70 with the plane of phenyl ring
(Figure 2).
Therefore total 3 possible conformers have been found to exist of
the 2-NP molecule. The energies of all the three optimized conformers
are -512.12911314 (C-1), -512.11232617 (C-2) and -512.10755721(C-3)
a.u. (Table 1). In the present paper we have considered the vibrational
characteristics of the most stableconformer C-1 only.
The optimized molecular geometries, APT charges and the
fundamental vibrational wave numbers along with their corresponding
intensities in IR spectrum, Raman activities and the depolarization
ratios of the Raman bands for the present molecule were computed at
the B3LYP/6-311++G** level using the Gaussian 09 program package.
The unscaled B3LYP/6-311++G** vibrational frequencies are generally
slightly larger than the experimental values. In order to achieve the
reasonable frequency matching, the scale factors proposed by Rauhut
and Pulay [42] were employed. The assignments of all the normal
modes of vibration have been made on the basis of the computed
PEDs. The experimental IR and Raman frequencies corresponding
to the fundamental modes have been compared with the calculated
fundamental frequencies in light of the PEDs. The molecular
electrostatic potential (ESP) surface, used for the predicting sites and
relative reactivity towards the electrophilic attack and in the studies of
biological recognition and hydrogen bonding interactions, has been
plotted and the complete thermo-molecular data analysis, complete

description of global reactivity parameters and essential features of
electro-magnetism of 2-NP have been investigated.

Results and Discussions
Molecular geometries
The geometrical parameters of 2-NP computed at the B3LYP/6311G** level of theory are compared with the experimental and MP2/631G* data in Table 2. The optimized geometrical structure of 2-NP has
overall Cs symmetry for the lowest energy conformer. The computed
O–H and N–O bond lengths are larger compared with the experimental
values. At the same time, the C–O and C–N bond lengths seem to
be somewhat shorter. These geometrical parameters are sensitive to
hydrogen bonding [15]. Taking into account the above considerations,
the data (Table 2) show good agreement between the experimental and
theoretical geometries with some minor discrepancies. The computed
O–H and N–O bond lengths are larger compared to the experimental
values. The computed bond angles are consistent at both levels
(Electron Diffraction and MP2/6-31G*) of theory; the deviations from
the experimental values are within or close to experimental error.
The bond lengths of C1-C2, C3-O11, C4-N13 and C5-C6 respectively are
shorter while those lengths of C1-C6, C2-C3, C3-C4, C4-C5 and O11-H12
respectively are found to be larger in the most stableconformer than
both the C-1 and C-2 conformers. Also, angle α (C4-C3-O11) is found to
be larger while angle α (O14-N13-O15) is found to be shorter in the most
stableconformer than the other two (Table 2). These conformational
discrepancies may be due to intra-molecular hydrogen bonding in the
most stableconformer and also due to instability of conformers C-2
and C-3 respectively.

APT charges
Atomic polarizability tensor (APT) charge is interpreted as the sum
of charge tensor and charge flux tensor, leading to a charge-charge flux
model [43,44]. The APT atomic charges (in unit of e) at various atomic
sites of 2-NP are collected in Table 3. The carbon atoms belonging
to the ring have alternately positive and negative APT charges with
different magnitudes. All the H and N atoms have positive APT
charges with different magnitudes, while the O atoms possess negative
and different magnitudes of APT charges. The N atom possesses the
highest magnitude which is connected directly to the ring and the two
O atoms. It is also noticeable that the magnitude of the APT charge on

C atoms except C3, have negative and small but different value while C3
atom, attached to OH group of 2-NP, have positive and largest value
amongst all the C atoms of 2-NP. All the H atoms on the ring possess
smaller but positive ESP charges while H atom of OH group attains
positive and largest value of all the H atoms in the molecule. The O
atoms possess negative ESP charges. The O atom of OH group attains
largest negative value (-0.590398 e) while N atom of NO2 group attains
largest positive value (0.681548 e) of ESP charges in 2-NP.

Vibrational assignments

Figure 2: Front and side views of conformer C-2 {a(i) & a(ii)} and conformer
C-3 {b(i) & b(ii)}of 2-NP.

The 2-NP molecule is a 15 atomic molecule with 39 normal modes
of vibration in which 30 modes are associated with the benzene ring
which are : 12 stretching modes -ν, 3 planar ring deformation -α(R),
3 non planar ring deformation -Φ(R), 6 planar deformation modes
-β(C-H) and 6 non-planar deformation modes -γ(C-H),out of which
2 of each i.e. β(C-H) and γ(C-H) become β(C-N), β(C-O) and γ(C-N),
γ(C-O) respectively. The three normal modes of OH-group are: OH
stretching -ν(OH), OH torsion -τ(OH) and C-O-H angle bending.
The six normal modes of the nitro group are: anti-symmetric NO2
stretching -νas(NO2), symmetric NO2 stretching -νs(NO2), NO2 rocking
-ρ(NO2), NO2 wagging -ω(NO2), NO2 scissoring -δ(NO2) and NO2
torsion -τ(NO2).

C3 attached to the OH group is the largest of all the C atoms. Also, it is
interesting to note that the N atom possesses positive APT charge. The
magnitude of the APT charge on H12 is the largest of all the H atoms.
The O atoms possess almost equal APT charges.

Mulliken atomic charges
Mulliken atomic charge calculation plays an important role in the
application of quantum chemical calculation to molecular systems,
because the atomic charges affect the dipole moment, polarizability,
electronic structure, and much more properties of the molecular
systems. Mulliken atomic charges (in unit of e) at various atomic sites
of 2-NP are collected in Table 3 from which it can be noticed that all the
carbon atoms except C4 and C5, have negative Mulliken atomic charges.
One of the O atoms attached to the N atom with a single bond possesses
positive Mulliken atomic charge. However, it is an electronegative atom
like N and O atoms. The H atoms possess positive Mulliken atomic
charge. The Mulliken atomic charge at the C atom attached to the OH
group is the largest of all the C atoms and the H atom of the OH group
possesses the largest Mulliken atomic charge of all the H atoms in the
C-1 conformer.

The calculated and observed vibrational frequencies along with
the corresponding PEDs and vibrational assignments are collected in
Table 4. The experimental and calculated IR and Raman spectra are
reproduced in Figure 3-6. The normal mode assignments have been
discussed under the following sections: (i) The phenyl ring modes (30),
(ii) The OH group modes (3) and (iii) The NO2 group modes (6).
Phenyl ring modes (30): The four C-H stretching modes ν (C-H)
are assigned to the frequencies 3034 (ν5), 3181(ν4), 3186(ν3) and 3205(ν2)
cm-1 which correspond dominantly to the modes ν(C1-H7), ν(C6-H10),
ν(C2-H8) and ν(C5-H9) respectively. The C-H stretching modes ν (CH) were assigned to the frequencies 3070, 3088, 3096 and 3117 cm-1
[41] and also to the frequencies 3208, 3229 and 3245 cm-1 [48]. The
C-H stretching vibrations are pure and highly localized modes. There
are 6 C-C stretching modes ν(R) due to the phenyl ring which are
identified as the computed frequencies 1002 (ν19), 1051 (ν18), 1306 (ν12),
1420 (ν10), 1547 (ν7), 1586 (ν6) cm-1. These modes are strongly coupled
with many other modes. These modes were assigned to the frequencies
1020, 1581 and 1620 cm-1 [41] and also to the frequencies 1369, 1551,
1584 and 1612 cm-1 [48]. The C-N and C-O stretching modes occur
at frequencies 667 (ν28), 1442 (ν9) cm-1 corresponding to the modes
ν(C4-N13) and ν(C3-O11) respectively. These modes are also coupled
with many other modes. The C-O stretching mode in the literature was
found to be corresponding to the frequency 1269 [41] and 1464 cm-1
[48].

ESP charges
The studies of effective atomic charges play a crucial role in the
application of quantum mechanical computations to the molecular
systems. Despite the conceptual problems associated with the dividing
up overall molecular charge density in atomic contributions, and all the
conventional problems related to the finding of convenient and robust
algorithm applicable to a wide range of the systems [45]. The beauty
of effective atomic charges as the parameters for the calculation of
electrostatic interactions in a various molecular mechanics simulation
packages is certainly one essential area of application. Partial atomic
charges play a different, but even more important, role in the
qualitative rationalization of organic and inorganic reactivity [46].
The molecular electrostatic potential (ESP) derived charges are those
are reproduced by fitting the partial atomic charges to reproduce the
molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) at a number of points around
the molecule at a (large) number of grid points using Merge-SinghKollman (MK) scheme [47].

There are three ring planar deformation modes which we assign as
the frequencies 865(ν22), 559(ν30) and 373(ν35) cm-1. These modes are
coupled with other modes as shown in the Table-4.The three ring nonplanar deformation modes are correlated to the frequencies 657(ν29),
413(ν34) and 141(ν38) cm-1 corresponding to modes 4 and 16(a,b) of the

mode was found to correspond to the frequency 3255 [41] and to the
frequency 3308 cm-1 [48]. The torsion of the OH group - τ(C3-O11)
occurs at frequency 720(ν26) cm-1 in our work and at the frequency 711
cm-1 [41] and is strongly coupled with other modes of vibrations. The
C-O-H angle bending- α(C3-O11-H12) mode is found to correspond to
the frequency 1349(ν11) cm-1 and also to the frequencies 1377 cm-1 [41]
and 1266/1426 cm-1 [48], which is also strongly coupled with many
modes.
NO2 group modes (6 modes): There are six modes of vibrations
due to the NO2 group , namely, asymmetric NO2 stretching -νas(NO2),
symmetric NO2 stretching-νs(NO2), NO2 rocking-ρ(NO2), NO2
wagging-ω(NO2), NO2 scissoring -δ(NO2) and NO2 torsion-τ(NO2)
which correspond to the frequencies 1511(ν8), 1226(ν14), 542(ν31),
683(ν27), 819(ν24) and 74(ν39) respectively. The NO2 torsion-τ(NO2)
is slightly coupled with τ(C3-O11) and the other five modes strongly
coupled with various vibrational modes. The modes νas(NO2),

conformers: The computed vibrational fundamentals of the three
conformers of 2-NP together with their respective differences have
been collected in Supplementary material (Table-S1). It could be
seen that the modes τ(C-OH) and ν(O-H) of the OH group show
very large frequency differences (in the range 350-400 cm-1). Also, the
modes τ(C4-N13), β(C3-O11), ω(NO2) α(C3-O11-H12) and νas(NO2) show
frequency differences of the order of a few tens of a wave number.
Clearly, major contribution for this frequency difference is expected
to come from H bonding between H12 and O15 atoms in the conformer
C-1 which is absent in the conformers C-2 /C-3. The phenyl ring modes
Φ3(R),α3(R), Φ2(R), γ(C-H) and ν(C-H) in the C-1 conformer have
higher magnitudes than the corresponding modes in the conformers
C-2 / C-3. However, the modes ω(NO2), β(C3-O11), ν(O11-H12), Φ1(R),
ν(C3-O11), ν(R) and β(C2-H8) have higher frequencies in the conformers
C-2 /C-3 than their corresponding modes in the most stableone.

Comparative study of vibrational modes for the three

Biochem Pharmacol (Los Angel)
ISSN:2167-0501 BCPC, an open access journal

The IR intensities and Raman activities for each of the three
conformers are collected in Supplementary material (Table-S2). It
is noticeable that the IR intensities for the C-1 conformer are much
higher than those of the C-2/C-3 conformers for the modes ν(O11-H12),
ν(C3-O11), νs(NO2), β(C2-H8), β(C1-H7), ν(R) ω(NO2), ρ(NO2) and
β(C4-N13) (S2).
The IR intensities for the modes α(C3-O11-H12), νas(N13-O14),
τ(C3-O11), α1(R), ν(C2-H8), ν(C5-H9), ν(O11-H12), νs(NO2), α2(R),
γ(C6-H10), β(C2-H8), β(C5-H9), δ(NO2) β(C3-O11), ν(C1-H7) and γ(C4-N13)
for the conformers C-2/C-3 are much higher than the conformer C-1.
One could see the major differences in the Raman activities for the
modes νs(NO2), ν(C3-O11), α(C3-O11-H12), ν(C2-H8), ν(R) ν(C5-H9),
as(NO2), ν(O11-H12), ν(C1-H7), δ(NO2), β(C1-H7), β(C6-H10) ν(C6-H10),
and β(C4-N13). Such discrepancies could be due to the hydrogen bonding
in the conformer C-1and the non-planar geometry of the C-2/C-3
conformers of 2-NP. The highest IR intensity and Raman activity for
C-1 occur for the modes ν(O11-H12) and ν(C2-H8) respectively and
those for C-2/C-3 for νas(NO2) and ν(C2-H8) respectively. From the
above discussion it is clear that the intra-molecular H-bonding plays a
crucial role in the molecular conformation.

HOMO–LUMO energy gap
The HOMO and LUMO studies are very important for quantum
chemistry. These orbitals are also known by the name frontier orbitals,
because they lie at the outermost boundaries of the electrons of the
molecules. Both the HOMO and the LUMO are the main orbitals
that take part in the chemical stability [49]. The kinetic stability of
the molecule is measured in terms of energy gap DE [32,50] and the
difference of the energies of the HOMO and LUMO is a measure of
the excitability of the molecule, the smaller the energy, more easily it
can be excited and vice versa. The lower HOMO and LUMO energy
gap explains the eventual CT interaction taking place within the
molecule, which is responsible for the bioactivity of the molecule. The
larger the value of the energy gap the higher the kinetic stability and
lower the chemical reactivity because it is energetically unfavorable to
add electrons to a high lying LUMO, to remove electrons from a low
lying HOMO and so to form the activated complex of any potential
reaction [33]. The sketch of the atomic orbital compositions of the
frontier MOs are shown in Figure 7. The green and red solid regions
in Figure 7 represent the MOs with completely opposite phases. The
present calculations predict that the energy gap (DE) of the 2-NP, i.e.
the transition energy from HOMO to LUMO of the 2-NP is 0.148189
a.u. This electronic transition corresponds to the transition from the
ground to the first excited state and is mainly described by an electron
excitation from HOMO to LUMO.

NLO characteristics: Static polarizability and first order
hyperpolarizability

Figure 6: Calculated - Raman spectra of 2-nitrophenol in two parts of
Raman shifts.

Quantum chemical computational theory has been shown to be
essential in the description of the relationship between the electronic
structure of the systems and its NLO response [55]. The NLO activities
provide the key functions for frequency shifting, optical switching,
optical modulation and optical logic to develop the technologies for the
communication, signal processing and optical interconnections [56].
The electric dipole moment (μ), the polarizability (α) and the hyper
polarizability (β) of the 2-NP molecule have been calculated by finite
field method using DFT-B3LYP method employing 6-311++G(d,p)
basis set for the isolated molecule, the origin of the Cartesian coordinate
system (x, y, z) = (0, 0, 0) was chosen at own centre of mass of 2-NP.
In the presence of an external electric field, the energy of a system is
a function of the field and the first hyperpolarizability is a third rank
tensor that can be described by a 3x3x3 matrix. The 27 components
of the 3D matrix can be reduced to 10 components using the Klein
man symmetry [57]. The matrix can be given in the lower tetrahedral
format. Clearly, the lower part of the 3x3x3 matrices is a tetrahedral.
The components of β are defined as the coefficients in the Taylor series
expansion of the energy in the external electric field. If the external field
is weak and homogeneous, this expansion is as given below,

=

E o – µi Fi – 1 / 2(α ij Fi F j – 1 / 6( βijk Fi F j Fk ) + − − − −

Here, Eo is the energy of the unperturbed molecules, Fi is the field
at the origin, μi, αij and βijk are the components of dipole moment,
polarizability and first hyperpolarizability, respectively.

A molecule having high ionization potential (Vp) or electron

The electrostatic potential (ESP) is the tool which is used to
study the intermolecular association and molecular properties of
small molecules, actions of drug molecules and their analogues, the
biological function of haemoglobin and enzyme catalysis [33,58-61].
ESP is widely used as the reactivity map displaying most probable
regions for the electrophilic attack of charged point-like reagents on
organic molecules [62]. The values and spatial distribution of ESP are
in fact responsible for the chemical behaviour of an agent in a chemical
reaction. They strongly influence the binding of a substrate to its active
site. ESP is typically visualized through mapping its values onto the
molecular ED. The different values of the electrostatic potential at the
surface are represented by different colors; the red represents regions
of the most negative electrostatic potential, the blue represents regions
of the most positive electrostatic potential and the green represents
regions of zero potential. Potential increases in the order red, orange,
yellow, green and blue. While the negative electrostatic potential
corresponds to an attraction of the proton by the concentrated ED in
the molecule (and is colored in shades of red), the positive electrostatic
potential corresponds to the repulsion of the proton by atomic nuclei
in regions where a low ED exists and the nuclear charge is incompletely
shielded (and is colored in shades of blue). The total density plot and its
array of the 2-NP are shown in the Figure 8. The molecular ESP values,
corresponding to Merge-Singh-Koll man scheme [47], of the 2-NP
molecule have been arranged in the Table 3. Also, the diagrammatic
demonstration of the MESP via map and its contour has been shown in
Figure 9. These Figs provide a visual representation of the chemically
active sites and comparative reactivity of atoms. The ESP plots and
the value arranged in the Table 3 predict that there are no regions of
positive and zero potential present in the molecule. Also, the Figure
9 and the data in the Table 3 predict that the sites associated with the
functional groups, namely, OH and NO2 groups are most reactive sites
for the neucleophilic reactions.

Thermo molecular characteristics
The studies of some thermo molecular characteristics, namely, zero
point vibrational energy, enthalpy, Gibb’s free energy, internal energy,
entropy, heat capacity, thermal energy and the partition functions etc.
have been found to play crucial role in the material characterization. We
have presented some thermal parameters in Table 6. It can be noticed
that all of the analysed thermodynamic parameters are increasing with
the temperature but G is found to decrease with T [Figure 10(a)-10(h)]
while the zero point vibrational energy remains constant (67.226 Kcal/
mol) at all the temperature because it is a characteristic property of
the molecule. All the fitting parameters and other essential statistical
data have been demonstrated together with the fitted graphs of these
parameters. All of the characteristic thermal properties of crystalline
2- NP solid have been found to be in agreement with the explanation
of Dulong-Pettit law as well as of Einstein’s thermo dynamical theory
of crystalline solids. The fitting equations of the thermal parameters of
2-NP are as given below;

All the thermo molecular data provide the crucial and helpful
information for the further study on the 2-NP. They can be applied
to compute the other thermodynamic characteristics according to
relationships of thermo dynamical parameters and estimate directions
of chemical reactions according to the second law of thermodynamics
in thermo chemical fields. It should be noticeable that all calculations
of thermo dynamical parameters have been done in gas phase and they
could not be used in solution phase.

NMR characterization: Magnetic susceptibility, shielding and
current density tensors
The NMR analysis plays an essential part in material
characterization in presence of magnetic fields. This type investigation
provides chemical shifts and magnetic shielding tensors to each atomic
site of the molecule as well as magnetic susceptibility and the current
density tensor for the material being investigated. We have applied
Continuous Set Gauge of Transformation (CSGT) method for NMR
investigation of the 2-NP molecule. The magnetic susceptibility tensor
of 2-NP has been computed as

respectively. It is noticeable that the shielding at every sites associated
to NO2 group is negative and attaining higher values [Figure 11(a, b)].
From the Figure 11 it is obvious that the effect of the magnetic field is
least nearby the NO2 group of 2-NP molecule.
The current density tensor (J) for the 2-NP have been computed

The two Eigen values of the current density tensor have been found
imaginary while one Eigen value of J is λ=0.0002 for 2-NP molecule.
The value of the J (~ 1.231x10-5 a.u.) has been found to be negligibly
small, which reveals that the electrical conductivity of 2-NP molecule is
negligibly small. The mapping and corresponding contour of J for the
title molecule have been demonstrated diagrammatically (Figure 12).
Figure 12 also represents that the current density is extremely weak for

For the first time; complete material characterization, complete
vibrational mode assignment, conformational analysis, HOMO
– LUMO analysis, complete data analysis on thermo-dynamical
parameters, data analysis on reactivity parameters and on NMR
parameters, potential energy distribution and investigations of
APT, Mulliken atomic charges and ESP derived charge of 2-NP has
been carried out. The 2-NP molecule has been expected to possess
three conformations out of which lowest energy conformer is planar
possessing Cs symmetry while other two are non-planar possessing

C1 symmetry. Conformer C-1 is planar, in which NO2 group is in the
plane of phenyl ring while in conformers C-2 and C-3 the plane of NO2
group makes the angle -33.70 and 33.70 respectively. The Nitrogen atom
of NO2 group attains highest APT charge while carbon atom directly
attached to OH group bears highest Mulliken charge. For lowest
energy conformer α (C4-C3-O11) is largest (124.60) and α(C3-O11-H12) is
smallest (107.30) respectively. For the modes τ(C3-O11) and ν(O11-H12)
are found to have very large frequency differences 394 and -352 cm-1
respectively among the conformers C-1 and C-2/C-2. ν(O11-H12)
is of largest IR intensity and ν(C2-H8) is found to be largest Raman
activity mode. All the modes of vibrations are precisely assigned to
the corresponding appropriate frequencies and also the experimental
work has been compared with the computational work as well as
the work already been carried out, which found to be in agreement
with our work. The HOMO–LUMO transition clearly explicates CT
interaction involving donor and acceptor groups. The ESP plots and
corresponding values show that there are neucleophilic most reactive
regions are found nearby OH and NO2 groups while no regions of
positive and zero potential present in the molecule. The HOMO –
LUMO energy gap is found to be ΔE = 0.148189 a.u. In conformer
C-1 intramolecular hydrogen bonding O15......H12 is expected in 2-NP
molecule. NMR investigations as well as HOMO- LUMO theory reveal
that the conductivity of the title molecule is extremely low and the
molecule is diamagnetic in nature.
