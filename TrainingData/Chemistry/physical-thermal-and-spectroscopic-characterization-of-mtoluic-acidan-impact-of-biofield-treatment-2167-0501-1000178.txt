Abstract
m-toluic acid (MTA) is widely used in manufacturing of dyes, pharmaceuticals, polymer stabilizers, and insect
repellents. The aim of present study was to evaluate the impact of biofield treatment on physical, thermal and
spectroscopic properties of MTA. MTA sample was divided into two groups that served as treated and control. The
treated group received Mr. Trivedi’s biofield treatment. Subsequently, the control and treated samples were evaluated
using X-ray diffraction (XRD), surface area analyser, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis
(TGA), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) and ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy. XRD result showed a decrease
in crystallite size in treated samples i.e. 42.86% in MTA along with the increase in peak intensity as compared to control.
However, surface area analysis showed an increase in surface area of 107.14% in treated MTA sample as compared to
control. Furthermore, DSC analysis results showed that the latent heat of fusion was considerably reduced by 40.32%,
whereas, the melting temperature was increased (2.23%) in treated MTA sample as compared to control. The melting
point of treated MTA was found to be 116.04°C as compared to control (113.51°C) sample. Moreover, TGA/DTG
studies showed that the control sample lost 56.25% of its weight, whereas, in treated MTA, it was found 58.60%. Also,
Tmax (temperature, at which sample lost maximum of its weight) was decreased by 1.97% in treated MTA sample as
compared to control. It indicates that the vaporisation temperature of treated MTA sample might decrease as compared
to control. The FT-IR and UV-Vis spectra did not show any significant change in spectral properties of treated MTA
sample as compared to control. These findings suggest that biofield treatment has significantly altered the physical and
thermal properties of m-toluic acid, which could make them more useful as a chemical intermediate.

Introduction
The m-toluic acid (MTA) is a benzoic acid derivative having a floral
honey odour. Benzoic acid occurs naturally in many plants and its name
was also derived from a plant source i.e. Gum benzoin. Although it is
used as precursor to plasticizers, preservatives such as sodium benzoate,
it also has wide application in many pharmaceutical preparations meant
for treatment of fungal skin diseases, topical antiseptics, expectorants,
analgesics and decongestants [1,2]. The benzoic acid derivatives are
also very useful due to their bacteriostatic and fragrant properties. They
are used as intermediate in the production of various pharmaceuticals
having analgesic, antirheumatic and vasodilator properties [3].
MTA is used as a chemical intermediate in manufacturing of insect
repellent and plastic stabilizer in the chemical industry. It is also used
in the production of various chemicals like 3-carboxybenzaldehyde,
3-benzoylphenylacetic acid, 3-methylbenzophenone, and N,N-diethyl3-methylbenzamide etc. [4,5]. It is a main component of N,N-diethylm-toluamide, commonly known as DEET, which is first insect repellent
that can be applied to skin or clothing and provide protection against
mosquitoes and other biting insects [6].
MTA is used as intermediate in various chemical reactions, hence
its rate of reaction plays a crucial role. It was reported previously that
any alteration in crystallite size and surface area can affect the kinetics
of reaction [7]. Moreover, the rate kinetics of any chemical reaction
also depends on the thermal properties of the intermediate chemical
compound i.e. latent heat of fusion, vaporisation temperature,
decomposition temperature etc. [8]. After considering the properties
and applications of MTA, authors wanted to investigate an economically
safe approach that could be beneficial to modify their physical, thermal
and spectral properties.

The concept of human bioenergy has its origin thousands of
years back. It is scientifically termed as the biologically produced
electromagnetic and subtle energy field that provides regulatory and
communication functions within the human organs [9]. It generates
through internal physiological processes such as blood flow, brain and
heart function, etc. Nowadays, many biofield therapies are in practice
for their possible therapeutic potentials such as enhanced personal
well-being, improved functional ability of arthritis patient, decreased
pain and anxiety [10-12]. The practitioners of these therapy claim that
the healers channel supraphysical energy and intentionally direct this
energy towards target [13]. Thus, a human has the ability to harness
the energy from environment or universe and can transmit into any
living or non-living object(s). The objects always receive the energy
and responding into useful way that is called biofield energy and the
process is known as biofield treatment.
Mr. Trivedi’s biofield treatment is well known and significantly
studied in different fields such as microbiology [14-16], agriculture
[17,18], and biotechnology [19]. Exposure to biofield energy caused an
increase in medicinal property, growth, and anatomical characteristics

of ashwagandha [20]. Recently, the impact of biofield treatment on
atomic, crystalline and powder characteristics as well as spectroscopic
characters of different materials was studied [21,22]. The biofield
treatment had increased the particle size by six fold and enhanced
the crystallite size by two fold in zinc powder [23]. Hence, based on
the outstanding results obtained after biofield treatment on different
materials and considering the pharmaceutical applications of MTA,
the present study was undertaken to evaluate the impact of biofield
treatment on physical, thermal and spectroscopic properties of MTA.

Materials and Methods
m-toluic acid (MTA) was procured from S D Fine Chemicals Pvt.
Ltd., India. The sample was divided into two parts; one was kept as a
control, while other was subjected to Mr. Trivedi’s biofield treatment
and coded as treated sample. The treatment sample in sealed pack
was handed over to Mr. Trivedi for biofield treatment under standard
laboratory conditions. Mr. Trivedi provided the treatment through his
energy transmission process to the treated group without touching
the sample. The biofield treated sample was returned in the similarly
sealed condition for further characterization using XRD, surface area
analyser, DSC, TGA, FT-IR and UV-Vis spectroscopic techniques.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) study
XRD analysis was carried out on Phillips, Holland PW 1710 X-ray
diffractometer system, which had a copper anode with nickel filter.
The radiation of wavelength used by the XRD system was 1.54056 Å.
The data obtained were in the form of a chart of 2θ vs. intensity and a
detailed table containing peak intensity counts, d value (Å), peak width
(θ°), relative intensity (%) etc.
The crystallite size (G) was calculated by using formula:
G = kλ/(bCosθ)
Here, λ is the wavelength of radiation used; b is full width half
maximum (FWHM) of peaks and k is the equipment constant (=0.94).
However, percent change in crystallite size was calculated using the
following equation:
Percent change in crystallite size = [(Gt-Gc)/Gc] ×100
Where, Gc and Gt are crystallite size of control and treated powder
samples respectively.

Surface area analysis
The surface area was measured by the Surface area analyser, Smart
SORB 90 based on Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET). Percent changes
in surface area were calculated using following equation:

% change in
=
surface area

[STreated -SControl ] ×100
SControl

Where, S Control and S Treated are the surface area of control and treated
samples respectively.

Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) study
For studies related to melting temperature and latent heat of fusion
of MTA, Differential Scanning Calorimeter (DSC) of Perkin Elmer/
Pyris-1, USA with a heating rate of 10°C/min under air atmosphere
and flow rate of 5 ml/min was used. Melting temperature and latent
heat of fusion were obtained from the DSC curve.
Percent change in latent heat of fusion was calculated using
following equations:

[ÄH Treated − ÄH Control ] ×100
ÄH Control

Where, ΔH Control and ΔH Treated are the latent heat of fusion of control
and treated samples, respectively. Similarly, percent change in melting
point was also calculated to observe the difference in thermal properties
of treated MTA sample as compared to control.

Thermogravimetric analysis/ Derivative Thermogravimetry
(TGA/DTG)
Thermal stability of control and treated sample of MTA was
analysed by using Mettler Toledo simultaneous Thermogravimetric
analyser (TGA/DTG). The samples were heated from room temperature
to 400°C with a heating rate of 5°C/min under air atmosphere. From
TGA curve, onset temperature Tonset (temperature at which sample
start losing weight) and from DTG curve, Tmax (temperature at which
sample lost its maximum weight) were recorded.
Percent change in temperature at which maximum weight loss
occur in sample was calculated using following equation:
% change in Tmax = [(Tmax, treated − Tmax, control) / Tmax, control] × 100
Where, Tmax, control and Tmax, treated are the temperature at which
maximum weight loss occurs in control and treated sample, respectively.
Percent change in onset peak temperature was calculated using
following equation:
% change in onset peak temperature Tonset = [(Tonset, treated−Tonset,
)/ Tonset, control] ×100
control
Where, Tonset, control and Tonset, treated are onset peak temperature in
control and treated sample, respectively.

Spectroscopic studies
For determination of spectroscopic characters, the treated sample
was divided into two groups i.e. T1 and T2. Both treated groups were
analysed for their spectral characteristics using FT-IR and UV-Vis
spectroscopy as compared to control MTA sample.

FT-IR spectroscopic characterization
FT-IR spectra were recorded on Shimadzu’s Fourier transform
infrared spectrometer (Japan) with the frequency range of 4000-500
cm-1. The samples are prepared by grinding the dry blended powders
of control and treated MTA with powdered KBr, and then compressed
to form discs. The FT-IR spectroscopic analysis of MTA (control, T1
and T2) were carried out to evaluate the impact of biofield treatment
at atomic and molecular level like bond strength, stability, rigidity of
structure etc. [24].

UV-Vis spectroscopic analysis
The UV-Vis spectral analysis was measured using Shimadzu
UV-2400 PC series spectrophotometer over a wavelength range of
200-400 nm with 1 cm quartz cell and a slit width of 2.0 nm. This
analysis was performed to evaluate the effect of biofield treatment on
the structural property of MTA sample. The UV-Vis spectroscopy
gives the preliminary information related to the skeleton of chemical
structure and possible arrangement of functional groups. With UVVis spectroscopy, it is possible to investigate electron transfers between
orbitals or bands of atoms, ions and molecules existing in the gaseous,
liquid and solid phase [24].

Results and Discussion

Surface area analysis

X-ray diffraction

The surface area of control and treated samples of MTA were
investigated using BET method. The control sample showed a surface
area of 0.14 m2/g however, the treated sample of MTA showed a surface
area of 0.29 m2/g. The percentage increase in surface area was 107.14%
in the treated MTA sample as compared to control (Figure 2). The XRD
results of treated MTA sample revealed that crystallite size decreased
after biofield treatment. It could be a possible reason for increase in
surface area of treated MTA sample [25]. Moreover, increase in surface
area of reactant molecules fastens the rate of reaction [26]. Hence, it is
hypothesized that increase in surface area of treated MTA sample can
be used to increase the rate of those reactions where MTA is used as
intermediate reagent.

X-ray diffraction study was conducted to study the crystalline
nature of the control and treated sample of MTA. XRD diffractograms
of control and treated samples of MTA are shown in Figure 1. The
XRD diffractogram of control MTA showed an intense crystalline
peak at 2θ equals to 14.00°. The single intense peak indicated the
crystalline nature of MTA. However, the XRD diffractogram of
treated MTA showed the crystalline peak at 2θ equals to 13.90°. The
treated sample peak showed high intensity as compared to control
that indicated that crystallinity of treated MTA sample increased
as compared to control. It is presumed that biofield energy may be
absorbed by the treated MTA molecules that may lead to formation
of more symmetrical crystalline long range pattern that caused
increase in intensity of peak. In addition, the crystallite size was
found to be 104.211 and 59.543 nm in control and treated MTA,
respectively. The crystallite size was decreased by 42.86% in treated
MTA as compared to control (Figure 2). The decreased crystallite
size may be due to biofield energy that can induce strain in lattice
and that possibly resulted in fracturing of grains into sub grains and
hence decreased crystallite size [23]. MTA is used as intermediate
in synthesis of many pharmaceutical compounds hence, decrease in
crystallite size may lead to fasten the rate kinetics which ultimately
enhances the percentage yield of end products [8].

Thermal studies
DSC analysis: DSC was used to determine ΔH and melting
temperature in control and treated sample of MTA. The DSC
thermograms of control and treated samples of MTA are shown in
Figure 3 and the analysis results are presented in Table 1. In a solid,
the amount of energy required to change the phase from solid to liquid
is known as latent heat of fusion (ΔH). Further, the energy supplied
during phase change i.e. ΔH is stored as potential energy of atoms. The
data showed that ΔH was reduced from 198.78 J/g (control) to 118.63
J/g in treated MTA. It indicates that ΔH was decreased by 40.32% in
treated sample as compared to control (Figure 5). The reduction in

ΔH revealed that treated MTA probably have extra internal energy
in the form of potential energy as compared to control, which might
be transferred through biofield treatment. This potential energy may
be stored in treated MTA molecules, that could lead to lowering of
ΔH in treated sample as compared to control. However, the melting
temperature is related to the kinetic energy of the atoms [27]. The
melting temperature of treated MTA was increased from 113.51°C
(control) to 116.04°C. Thus, data suggest that melting point was
increased by 2.23% as compared to control (Figure 5). Previously, our
group reported that biofield treatment has altered ΔH and melting
point in lead and tin powder [28]. Besides, the increase of melting point
in treated MTA suggests that kinetic energy and thermal vibrations
of molecules probably altered after biofield treatment. In addition,
the sharpness of the endothermic peaks showed a good degree of
crystallinity in control and treated sample of MTA.
TGA/DTG analysis: Thermogravimetric analysis/derivative
thermogravimetry analysis (TGA/DTG) of control and biofield treated
samples are summarized in Table 1. TGA thermogram (Figure 4)
showed that control MTA sample started losing weight around 170°C
(onset) and stopped near 212°C (end set). However, the treated MTA
started losing weight near to 164°C (onset) and terminated near
209°C (end set). It indicates that onset temperature of treated MTA
decreased by 3.52% as compared to control (Figure 5). Furthermore,
in this process, control sample lost 56.25% and treated MTA sample
lost 58.60% of its weight, which could be due to vaporisation of MTA.
Besides, DTG thermogram data showed Tmax at 187.02°C in control,
whereas, it was decreased to 183.32°C in treated MTA (Table 1). It
indicates that Tmax was decreased by 1.97% in treated MTA (Figure
5). Furthermore, the reduction in Tmax in treated MTA with respect
to control sample may be correlated with increase in vaporisation
of treated MTA after biofield treatment. A possible reason for this
reduction in Tmax is that biofield energy might cause some alteration in
internal energy which results into earlier vaporisation of treated MTA

sample as compared to control. Moreover, it was previously reported
that the state of reactant affect rate of reaction, i.e. gases reacts faster
than solid and liquids because gases consumed less energy to separate
their particles from each other [26]. Also, decrease in vaporisation
temperature indicates that MTA molecules change their phase from
liquid to vapour at low temperature, which may result in more frequent
collision of MTA molecules with other reactants at low temperature,
hence fasten the reaction rate [26]. Apart from that, it was previously
reported that vapour phase reaction can be more advantageous as
compared to liquid phase reaction in terms of reaction time, generation
of objectionable amounts of odour and undesired by-products [29,30].
Hence, overall observations suggest that biofield treated MTA can be
used to enhance the reaction kinetics and yield of the end product.

Spectroscopic studies
FT-IR analysis: FT-IR spectra of control, T1 and T2 samples of MTA
are shown in Figure 6. It showed similar distribution patterns for both
control and treated (T1 and T2) samples of MTA. The O-H stretching
(carboxylic acid) peak was appeared at 3061-2576 cm-1 in control MTA. In
treated samples, O-H stretching (carboxylic acid) peak appeared in same
range i.e. 3061-2576 cm-1 in T1 and 3064-2576 cm-1 in T2 sample. The peak
due to C-H stretching (sp3) was appeared at 2951, 2953 and 2951 cm-1 in
control, T1 and T2 sample respectively. The C=O stretching (carboxylic
acid) peak was appeared at 1689 cm-1 in control and 1685 cm-1 in both T1
and T2 samples. The peak due to aromatic C=C stretching was appeared
at 1608 cm-1 in all three samples i.e. control, T1 and T2. Similarly C-C
stretching peak (in ring) was found at 1589 cm-1 in all three samples i.e.
control, T1 and T2. O-H bending peak was found at 1417, 1415 and 1417
cm-1 in control, T1 and T2 sample respectively. C-O stretching (carboxylic
acid) peak was appeared at 1311 cm-1 in all three samples i.e. control, T1
and T2. Similarly, C-OH stretching peak appeared at 1217 cm-1 in all three
samples i.e. control, T1 and T2. C-H bending (out of plane) peak was
found at 931 cm-1 in control and 933 cm-1 in both T1 and T2 sample. The
peak due to meta substituted arene was appeared at 748 cm-1 in control
and T1 and at 750 cm-1 in T2. The FT-IR spectra were well supported by
reference data [31].
The FT-IR spectroscopic study showed that no alteration was
found in FT-IR spectra of treated samples (T1 and T2) as compared to
control. It suggests that biofield treatment did not cause any alteration
in structural and bonding properties like bond strength, stability,
rigidity of structure etc.

at 204 nm which was also observed in both treated samples (T1 and
T2) at 203 nm. Another absorption peak was observed at 230 nm in
control sample which was evident in T1 and T2 at 230 nm and 229 nm
respectively. The spectrum of control sample showed weak absorption
at 278 nm. The treated samples i.e. T1 and T2 also showed same kind
of peak at 278 nm and 275 nm respectively. The UV spectrum of

biofield treatment could not make any alteration in chemical structure
or arrangement of functional groups of treated MTA samples.

physical and thermal properties of MTA. XRD result showed that
crystallite size was decreased by 42.86% in treated MTA samples as

compared to control, which might be due to fracturing of grains into
sub grains caused by lattice strain produced via biofield energy. The
surface area analysis showed an increase in surface area of 107.14% in
treated MTA sample as compared to control. The reduced crystallite
size and increased surface area may lead to increasing the reaction
kinetics of MTA, which could make it more useful as an intermediate
compound. Thermal analysis data revealed that latent heat of fusion
was reduced by 40.32% in treated MTA as compared to control. TGA/
DTG studies showed that Tmax was decreased by 1.97% in treated MTA
samples. On the basis of reduction in Tmax, it is hypothesized that MTA
molecules turn into vapour phase at low temperature as compared
to control. Hence, molecules in vapour phase may collide more
frequently with other reactants in any reaction that might enhance
the rate of reaction. Therefore, it is assumed that biofield treated MTA
could be more useful as an intermediate in the production of various
pharmaceutical products.
