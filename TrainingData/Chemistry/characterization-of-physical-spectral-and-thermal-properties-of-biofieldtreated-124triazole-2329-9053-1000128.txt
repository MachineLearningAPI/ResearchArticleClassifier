Abstract
Triazoles are an important class of compounds used as core molecule for the synthesis of many pharmaceutical
drugs. The objective of the present research was to investigate the influence of biofield treatment on physical,
spectral and thermal properties of 1,2,4-triazole. The study was performed in two groups, control and treatment.
The control group remained as untreated, and biofield treatment was given to treatment group. The control and
treated 1,2,4-triazole were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC),
Thermo Gravimetric analysis (TGA), Surface area analyzer, and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy.
XRD analysis revealed a decrease in unit cell volume of treated 1,2,4-triazole (662.08 10-24 cm3) as compared to
control sample (666.34 10-24 cm3). Similarly, a decrease in molecular weight of treated 1,2,4-triazole (69.78 g/mol)
with respect to control (70.23 g/mol) was observed. Additionally, a substantial decrease in crystallite size (G) was
observed in treated 1,2,4-triazole by 16.34% with respect to control. DSC analysis showed a slight increase in
melting temperature of treated 1,2,4-triazole (124.22°C) as compared to control (123.76°C). Moreover, a significant
increase in latent heat of fusion was noticed in treated 1,2,4-triazole by 21.16% as compared to control sample.
TGA analysis showed a significant increase in maximum thermal decomposition temperature (Tmax) of treated
1,2,4-triazole (213.40°C) as compared to control (199.68°C). Surface area analysis using BET showed a substantial
increase in surface area of the treated compound by 13.52% with respect to control. However, FT-IR analysis
showed no structural changes in treated 1,2,4-triazole with respect to control. Overall, the result showed significant
alteration of physical and thermal properties of the treated 1,2,4-triazole with respect to control.

Introduction
Now-a-days research is focused towards the introduction of
novel and biologically safe therapeutic agents. Recently nitrogencontaining heterocycles are commonly found in most of the medicinal
compounds. Triazoles are fused heterocyclic compounds that have
received considerable attention owing to their synthetic and medicinal
importance. Especially, 1,2,4-triazole was used as core molecule
for the synthesis of different pharmacological agents such as antiinflammatory, CNS stimulants, sedative, anti-anxiety, antimicrobial,
and anti-migraine activity [1]. 1,2,4-Triazole derivatives have received
considerable attention as antifungal agents such as fluconazole and
itraconazole [2-4]. These compounds have advantages due to its low
toxicity, high oral bioavailability and a broad spectrum of activity against
several fungi [5-7]. Kurtzer, et al. reported that 4-amino-5-mercapto3-substituted-1,2,4-triazole compound has excellent antifungal, antiinflammatory and anti-tubercular activities that make them potential
chemotherapeutic agents [8].
The chemical and physical stability of the pharmaceutical
compounds are more desired quality attributes that directly affect its
safety, efficacy, and shelf life [9]. Hence, it is required to explore some
new alternate approach that could alter the physical and chemical
properties of the compounds. Mohammadi et al. used fast neutron and
gamma irradiation to investigate the thermal, structural and physical
properties of an organic compound [10]. Recently biofield treatment

was used as an excellent strategy for modification of spectral properties
of various pharmaceutical drugs like paracetamol, piroxicam, and
physicochemical properties of metals, beef extract, and meat infusion
powder [11-13].
Recently it was discovered that electrical process occurring in
the human body has a relation with the magnetic field. Rivera-Ruiz
et al. reported that electrocardiography has been extensively used to
measure the biofield of the human body [14]. According to Ampere’s
law, the moving charge produces the magnetic field in surrounding
space. Likewise, human body emits the electromagnetic waves in the
form of bio-photons, which surrounds the body, and it is commonly
known as biofield. Therefore, the biofield consists of an electromagnetic
field, being generated by moving electrically charged particles (ions,
cell, molecule, etc.) inside the human body. Thus, human beings have
the ability to harness the energy from environment/Universe and can
transmit into any object (living or non-living) around the Globe. The
object(s) always receive the energy and responding in a useful manner
that is called biofield energy. Mr. Trivedi’s unique biofield treatment

is also known as The Trivedi Effect®. Mr. Trivedi biofield treatment is
known to transform the characteristics of various living and nonliving
things. The biofield treatment has improved the growth and production
of agriculture crops [15-18] and significantly altered the phenotypic
characteristics of various pathogenic microbes [19-21]. Additionally,
biofield treatment has substantially altered the medicinal, growth and
anatomical properties of ashwagandha [22].
Based on the excellent outcome from biofield treatment and
interesting pharmaceutical applications of 1,2,4-Triazole, this work
was undertaken to investigate the impact of biofield treatment on this
compound.

Materials and Methods
1,2,4-triazole was procured from SD Fine Chemicals Limited,
India. The sample was divided into two parts; one was kept as a control
sample while the treatment group (T) was in sealed pack and handed
over to Mr. Trivedi for biofield treatment under laboratory condition.
Mr. Trivedi provided the treatment through his energy transmission
process to the treated group without touching the sample. The control
and treated samples were characterized by XRD, DSC, TGA, surface
area analysis, and FT-IR.

Characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) study
XRD analysis of control and treated 1,2,4-triazole was carried out
on Phillips, Holland PW 1710 X-ray diffractometer system, which had
a copper anode with nickel filter. The radiation of wavelength used by
the XRD system was 1.54056 Å. The data obtained from this XRD were
in the form of a chart of 2θ vs. intensity and a detailed table containing
peak intensity counts, d value (Å), peak width (θ°), relative intensity
(%) etc. The crystallite size (G) was calculated by using formula:

G = k λ / ( bCosθ )

Here, λ is the wavelength of radiation used, b is full width halfmaximum (FWHM) of peaks and k is the equipment constant (=0.94).

heat of fusion (∆H) of samples. The control and treated 1,2,4-triazole
samples were analyzed using a Pyris-6 Perkin Elmer DSC on a heating
rate of 10°C/min under air atmosphere and air was flushed at a flow rate
of 5 mL/min. The sample was kept in an aluminum pan and covered
with a lid. Another blank covered aluminum pan was used as reference
in the study.

Thermo Gravimetric Analysis-Differential Thermal Analysis
(TGA-DTA)
Thermal stability of control and treated 1,2,4-triazole were analyzed
by using Mettler Toledo simultaneous TGA and Differential thermal
analyzer (DTA). The samples were heated from room temperature to
400°C with a heating rate of 5°C/min under air atmosphere.
Percent change in temperature at which maximum weight loss

analyzer, SMART SORB 90 Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) using ASTM
D 5604 method which had a detection range of 0.2-1000 m2/g. Percent

24.67°, 26.16°, 26.40°, 27.74°, 28.10°, 31.14°, 32.34°, 32.54°, 54.70° and
54.86°. Similarly, the treated 1,2,4-triazole showed crystalline peaks at
2θ equal to 18.00°, 18.20°, 18.97°, 22.26°, 22.44°, 22.65°, 23.77°, 24.42°,
24.70°, 26.21°, 26.37°, 28.12° and 31.32°. The result showed that few XRD
peaks of control 1,2,4-triazole originally present at 2θ equal to 22.57°,
24.67° and 28.10° were shifted to 22.65°, 24.70° and 28.12° respectively,
in treated sample. Moreover, the intensity was significantly increased
for these XRD peaks of treated 1,2,4-triazole as compared to control,
indicating an increase in crystallinity (Figure 1). It is hypothesized that
biofield treatment may cause the formation of the long-range order of
treated 1,2,4-triazole molecules which leads to increase in crystallinity
with respect to control. Based on the XRD data of control and treated
1,2,4-triazole the crystal structure was orthorhombic.

The unit cell volume, molecular weight and crystallite size of
control and treated 1,2,4-triazole were computed from the respective
XRD diffractogram and data are depicted in Table 1.
The unit cell volume of control 1,2,4-triazole was 666.34×10-24 cm3;
however it was decreased slightly to 662.08 × 10-24 cm3 in treated sample.
The decrease in volume of unit cell volume was 0.64% as compared
to control. It is assumed that compressive stress may applied due to
biofield treatment that decreases the parameter and unit cell volume.
Whereas the molecular weight of control 1,2,4-triazole was decreased
by 0.64% with respect to control. It is speculated that biofield may cause

an alteration in proton to neutron ratio in the treated 1,2,4-triazole that
leads to a reduction in molecular weight.
The crystallite size of control and treated 1,2,4-triazole were
computed from the Scherrer formula (crystallite size=kλ/bcos θ) and
presented in Figure 2.
The crystallite size of control 1,2,4-triazole was 84.36 nm and it
was decreased to 70.58 nm in treated 1,2,4-triazole. The result showed
a decrease in crystallite size of biofield treated 1,2,4-triazole by 16.33%
with respect to control. Researchers have reported that ball milling and
similar other treatment methods cause a substantial decrease in grain
size and crystallite size of materials [23]. Suryanarayana reported that
crystallite size/grain size decreases rapidly in early stages of milling and
then slowly reaches a few nanometers in a short time [24]. Previously
it was reported that biofield treatment had substantially reduced
the crystallite size of vanadium pentoxide powders [25]. Hence, it is
assumed that biofield treatment may provide energy milling to the
treated 1,2,4-triazole samples that lead the creation of linear defects
particularly dislocations which results in higher dislocation density and
decrease in crystallite size [23].

DSC study
DSC was used to study the latent heat of fusion and melting behavior
of the 1,2,4-triazole. Figure 3 showed the DSC thermogram of control
and treated 1,2,4-triazole. DSC thermogram of control 1,2,4-triazole
showed a sharp endothermic peak at 123.76°C. However the treated

1,2,4-triazole showed an intense endothermic peak at 124.22°C,
corresponded to melting temperature of the sample (Figure 3).
This showed a slight increase in melting temperature of the biofield
treated sample with respect to control. When molecules come out
from the regular pattern of the material and starts to vibrate thermally,
that is known as melting temperature. Researchers have showed that
melting temperature of a material depends on its kinetic energy [26].
It is assumed that biofield treatment may altered the kinetic energy
of the treated 1,2,4-triazole that leads to a slight increase in melting
temperature with respect to control.
Latent heat of fusion of control and treated 1,2,4-triazole were
computed from the respective thermograms and data are reported in
Table 2.
It was suggested that a material consist of strong intermolecular
forces between them that holds them tightly on their positions. The
energy needed to overcome this strong intermolecular force is known
as latent heat of fusion. This latent heat of fusion is stored as potential
energy in the atoms during its phase transition from solid to liquid. The
control sample showed a latent heat of fusion of 132.51 J/g and it was
considerably increased in treated 1,2,4-triazole (160.55 J/g). The result
showed a significant increase in latent heat of fusion by 21.16% with
respect to the control sample. It is speculated that biofield treatment
may alter the stored potential energy in the sample that leads to increase
in latent heat of fusion of the sample.

TGA analysis
Thermo gravimetric analysis is a technique used to evaluate the
thermal stability, vaporization and sublimation of the sample. TGA
thermogram of control and treated 1,2,4-triazole are presented in
Figure 4.
The control 1,2,4-triazole started to degrade thermally around 186°C
(onset), and it stopped at around 226°C (end set). During this process,
the sample lost 53.79% of its weight. However, the treated 1,2,4-triazole
started to thermally decompose at 200°C (onset), and it terminated at
around 243°C (end set). The sample lost 50.71% of its weight during
this process. This showed an increase in onset temperature of treated
1,2,4-triazole with respect to the control sample. This may be inferred
as high thermal stability of treated 1,2,4-triazole with respect to control.
DTA thermogram of control and treated 1,2,4-triazole are presented
in Figure 4. DTA thermogram of control 1,2,4-triazole showed two
endothermic peaks at 121.98°C and 210.42°C. The first endothermic
peak was corresponded to melting temperature and second was due
to thermal decomposition of the sample. DTA thermogram of treated
1,2,4-triazole also showed two endothermic peaks at 123.15°C and
222.93°C. The former peak was due to melting temperature of the
treated 1,2,4-triazole and latter peak was corresponded to thermal
decomposition of the sample. DTA showed an increase in decomposition
temperature of treated 1,2,4-triazole with respect to control.

treated 1,2,4-triazole. The result showed 6.87% increase in Tmax of
treated 1,2,4-triazole as compared to control sample. Overall, the
increase in onset temperature, and Tmax corroborated the high thermal
stability of treated compound as compared to control 1,2,4-triazole.
According to Boltzman law of energy distribution among molecules at
any temperature a portion of molecules will possess energy higher than
the bond energy.
K=Ae-E/RT
Where, A is the frequency factor related to vibration frequency of a
critical mode of vibration in molecules and E is the excess energy which
must be concentrated in the molecule in order to decompose it. K is
the rate of decomposition. In this equation temperature (T) is inversely
proportional to rate of thermal decomposition (K). Similarly in this
work rate of decomposition was decreased with increasing temperature
and increase in thermal stability. Additionally, it was reported that A
should be minimized in order to increase the thermal stability of the
organic compounds [27]. Hence, it is assumed that biofield treatment
may be acted on the treated 1,2,4-triazole and minimized the frequency
of critical mode of vibration of molecules that leads to increase in
thermal stability of treated sample with respect to control.

Surface Area Analysis
The surface area of control and treated 1,2,4-triazole were evaluated
using BET analyzer and results are presented in Figure 5. The control
1,2,4-triazole showed a surface area of 0.3802 m2/g and it was increased
considerably to 0.4316 m2/g in treated sample. The result showed an
increase in surface area by 13.52% with respect to control. The possible

cause of an increase in surface area of treated 1,2,4-triazole could be
the decrease in particle size of 1,2,4-triazole after biofield treatment.
It was reported that decrease in particle size increases the surface area
and vice versa [28,29]. Biofield treatment may provide energy milling
which led to the formation of grain into sub grain that caused decrease
in particle size and increase in surface area [30].

FT-IR spectroscopy
FT-IR spectra of control and treated 1,2,4-triazole (T1 and T2)
samples are presented in Figure 6.The FT-IR spectrum of control
1,2,4-triazole showed characteristic absorption peaks at 3097 and 3032
cm-1 due to C-H aromatic vibrations. Vibration peak at 3126 cm-1 was
due N-H stretching of the sample. FT-IR peaks at 1529 and 1483 cm-1
were corresponded to C=C stretching for aromatic groups. Vibration
peak for –N=N stretching was observed at 1543 cm-1 [31]. Likewise,
the FT-IR spectrum of 1,2,4-triazole (T1) showed absorptions peaks
at 3095, and 3034 cm-1 that were due to C-H aromatic vibrations.
N-H stretching vibration was observed at 3128 cm-1 in the sample.
FT-IR peaks observed at 1529, and 1483 cm-1 were corresponded to
C=C (aromatic) stretching vibration peak (Figure 6). Vibration peak
for –N=N stretching was observed at 1543 cm-1. FT-IR spectrum of
1,2,4-triazole (T2) showed absorption peaks at 3028 cm-1 that were due
to C-H (aromatic) stretching vibrations. N-H stretching vibration peak
was observed at 3128 cm-1 in the sample. C=C (aromatic) stretching
vibrations were observed at 1529, and 1481 cm-1. N=N stretching peak

Conclusions
XRD results showed a reduction in unit cell volume and molecular
weight of treated 1,2,4-triazole as compared to control. A substantial
decrease in crystallite size was evidenced in treated 1,2,4-triazole that
may be due to compressive stress caused through biofield treatment
with respect to control. DSC characterization showed a slight increase
in melting temperature with respect to control. A significant increase
in latent heat of fusion was observed in treated 1,2,4-triazole than the
control sample. TGA showed a substantial increase in Tmax of treated
compound as compared to control. This indicated the increase in
thermal stability of 1,2,4-triazole after biofield treatment. The surface
area was increased considerably in treated sample that may improve
the solubility of the compound with respect to control. However, no
significant change was found in FT-IR absorption peaks of treated
1,2,4-triazole in comparison with control. Based on results it was found
that biofield treatment has significantly influenced the physical and
thermal properties of treated 1,2,4-triazole. It is assumed that treated
1,2,4-triazole could be used for synthesis of pharmaceutical compounds.
