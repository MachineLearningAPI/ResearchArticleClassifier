The effect of the small amount of formalin in the SurePath liquid when establishing protocols for
immunocytochemistry

Objective: To investigate the effect of the small amount of formaldehyde in the SurePath liquid (< 0.2 %) when establishing a
routine protocol for immunocytochemistry.
Materials & Methods: Rest material from unfixed effusions containing either carcinoma cells or a fair number of mesothelial
cells. The cells were transferred to Surepath and left in the liquid for 1, 5 and 12 days before immunostaining. Day 0 equaled a
staining protocol not using Surepath for fixation. CK7 was used as a test marker because it was easy to find suitable rest effusion
material. Immunostaining was done at several time points and with varying protocols for pretreatment and incubation of CK7
AB. Adding or omitting neutral buffred formalin (NBF) was also recorded. The cytoplasmic staining intensity of carcinoma
cells and/or mesothelial cells was evaluated.
Results & Conclusions: The small amount of formaldehyde in SurePath influences the immuno reactivity of cells in the liquid.
Reduced staining intensity may be seen within 5 days of storage in the SurePath liquid. HRT is essential and the pretreatment
must reflect the routine storage time of cells in Surepath liquid before eventual immunostaining.
