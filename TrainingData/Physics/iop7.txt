Abstract. Silicene is a monolayer of silicon atoms forming a two-dimensional
(2D) honeycomb lattice and shares almost all the remarkable properties of
graphene. The low-energy structure of silicene is described by Dirac electrons
with relatively large spin–orbit interactions owing to its buckled structure. A key
observation is that the band structure can be controlled by applying an electric
field to a silicene sheet. In particular, the gap closes at a certain critical electric
field. Examining the band structure of a silicene nanoribbon, we show that
a topological phase transition occurs from a topological insulator to a band
insulator with an increase of electric field. We also show that it is possible to
generate helical zero modes anywhere in a silicene sheet by adjusting the electric
field locally to this critical value. The region may act as a quantum wire or a
quantum dot surrounded by topological and/or band insulators. We explicitly
construct the wave functions for some simple geometries based on the lowenergy effective Dirac theory. These results are also applicable to germanene,
which is a 2D honeycomb structure of germanium.

1. Introduction

Graphene, a monolayer honeycomb structure of carbon atoms, is one of the most important
topics in condensed matter physics [1]. One of the obstacles to using graphene for electronic
devices is that electrons cannot be confined by applying an external electric field [2]. Therefore,
graphene nanostructures such as graphene nanoribbons [3] and nanodiscs [4] have been
considered, which are fabricated by cutting a graphene sheet. Recently, a new material,
a monolayer honeycomb structure of silicon called silicene, has been synthesized [5–7] and
has attracted much attention [8–10]. Silicene has Dirac cones akin to graphene. Almost every
striking property of graphene is shared by this innovative material. Furthermore, silicene has the
advantage that it can be incorporated easily into silicon-based electronic technology.
Silicene has a remarkable property that graphene does not share: this is the buckled
structure [9, 10] due to the large ionic radius of silicon (figure 1). Consequently, silicene has
a relatively large spin–orbit (SO) gap of 1.55 meV, which makes experimentally accessible
the Kane–Mele-type quantum spin Hall (QSH) effect or the topological insulator [9, 10]. The
topological insulator [11, 12] is a new state of quantum matter characterized by a full insulating
gap in the bulk and gapless edges topologically protected. These states are made possible due
to a combination of the SO interaction and the time-reversal symmetry. The two-dimensional
(2D) topological insulator is a QSH insulator with helical gapless edge modes [13], which is a
close cousin of the integer quantum Hall state. The QSH insulator was proposed by Kane and
Mele [14] in graphene. However, since the SO gap is rather weak in graphene, the QSH effect
can occur in graphene only at unrealistically low temperatures [15, 16].
The buckled structure implies an intriguing possibility that we can control the band
structure by applying an electric field (figure 1). In this paper, we analyze the band structure
under the electric field E z applied perpendicular to a silicene sheet. Silicene is a Z2 topological
insulator [9] at E z = 0. By increasing E z , we demonstrate the following. The gap decreases
linearly to zero at a certain critical field E c and then increases linearly. Accordingly, silicene
undergoes a topological phase transition from a topological insulator to a band insulator. At the
critical point (E z = E c ), spins are perfectly spin-up (spin-down) polarized at the K(K ) point.
We also investigate the zero-energy states under an inhomogeneous electric field E z (x, y)
based on the low-energy effective Dirac theory. There emerge helical zero modes in the region
where E z (x, y) = E c . It is intriguing that the region is not necessarily 1D: the region can be
2D and have any shape, where Dirac electrons can be confined. It is surrounded by topological

and/or band insulators. Our result may be the first example in which helical zero modes appear
in regions other than the edge of a topological insulator. The region may act as a quantum wire
or a quantum dot. We construct explicitly the wave functions describing helical zero modes for
regions having simple geometries. In conclusion, we are able to realize a dissipationless spin
current anywhere in the bulk of a silicene sheet by tuning the electric field locally.
2. Topological and band insulators

Silicene consists of a honeycomb lattice of silicon atoms with two sublattices made of A sites
and B sites. The states near the Fermi energy are π orbitals residing near the K and K points
at opposite corners of the hexagonal Brillouin zone. We take a silicene sheet on the x y-plane,
and apply the electric field E z (x, y) perpendicular to the plane. Due to the buckled structure the
two sublattice planes are separated by a distance, which we denote by 2 with = 0.23 Å, as
illustrated in figure 1. It generates a staggered sublattice potential ∝ 2 E z (x, y) between silicon
atoms at A sites and B sites.
The silicene system is described by the four-band second-nearest-neighbor tight binding
model [10],

the next-nearest neighbors, and the sum is taken over all pairs i, j of the second-nearestneighboring sites. The third term represents the Rashba SO coupling with λR = 0.7 meV, where
µi j = ±1 for the A (B) site, and di0j = di j /|di j |. The fourth term is the staggered sublattice
potential term, where ζi = ±1 for the A (B) site. Note that the first and the second terms
constitute the Kane–Mele model proposed to demonstrate the QSH effect in graphene [14].
The same Hamiltonian as (2.1) can be used to describe germanene, which is a honeycomb
structure of germanium [9, 10], where the various parameters are t = 1.3 eV, λSO = 43 meV,
λR = 10.7 meV and = 0.33 Å . Hence the following analysis is applicable to germanene as
well. We study the band structure of silicene by applying a uniform electric field E z . By
diagonalizing the Hamiltonian (2.1), the band gap (E z ) is determined to be
(E z ) = 2 | E z − ηsz λSO | ,

(2.2)

where sz = ±1 is the electron spin and η = ±1 is for the K or K point (which we refer to also
as the K± point). See also the dispersion relation (3.4), which we derive based on the lowenergy effective theory. We emphasize that it is independent of the Rashba SO coupling λR . The
gap (2.2) vanishes at E z = ηsz E c with
−1

E c = λSO / = 17 meV Å .

(2.3)

We plot the band gap (E z ) in figure 2.
The gap closes at E z = ±E c , where it is a semimetal due to gapless modes. We show the
band structure at E z = E c in figure 3. It follows from (2.2) that up-spin (sz = +1) electrons are
gapless at the K point (η = +1), while down-spin (sz = −1) electrons are gapless at the K point
(η = −1). Namely, spins are perfectly up (down) polarized at the K(K ) point under the uniform
electric field E z = E c .
It follows from the gap formula (2.2) that silicene is an insulator for E z = ±E c . In order to
tell the difference between the two insulators realized for |E z | < E c and |E z | > E c , we study the
band structure of a silicene nanoribbon with zigzag edges. The gap structure is depicted at two
typical points, E z = 0 and E z = 2E c , in figure 4. We see that there are gapless modes coming
from the two edges at |E z | < E c , as is the demonstration of a topological insulator [9]. On the
other hand, there are no gapless edge modes for |E z | > E c , showing that it is a band insulator. We
conclude that a topological phase transition occurs between a topological insulator (|E z | < E c )
and a band insulator (|E z | > E c ) as E z changes.

gap are edge states, demonstrating that it is a topological insulator. There are two
edge states since a nanoribbon has two edges (red and blue lines for the left and
right edges). (b) All states are gapped, demonstrating that it is a band insulator.
The reason why gapless modes appear at the edge of a topological insulator is understood
as follows. The topological insulator has a nontrivial topological number, the Z2 index [14],
which is defined only for a gapped state. When a topological insulator has an edge beyond
which the region has the trivial Z2 index, the band must close and yield gapless modes in the
interface. Otherwise the Z2 index cannot change its value across the interface.

3. Low-energy Dirac theory

We proceed to analyze the physics of electrons near the Fermi energy in more detail. The lowenergy Dirac theory has been proved to be essential for the study of graphene [17] and its various
derivatives [18, 19]. It must also be indispensable for exploring deeper physics of helical zero
modes and for promoting further research in silicene.
We may derive the low-energy effective Hamiltonian from the tight binding model (2.1)
around the Kη point as [10]
Hη = h¯ vF k x τx − ηk y τ y + ητz h 11 + E z τz ,

with s being spin chility, which yields the result (2.2) to the gap energy at k = 0, where s = ηsz .
4. Inhomogeneous electric field

The low-energy Dirac theory allows us to investigate analytically the properties of the helical
zero mode under an inhomogeneous electric field. In doing so we set λR = 0 to simplify
calculations. This approximation is justified for the following reasons. First of all, we have
numerically checked that the band structure is rather insensitive to λR based on the tight-binding
Hamiltonian (2.1 ). Secondly, λR appears only in the combination λR k± in the Hamiltonian (3.1),
which vanishes exactly at the K± points. Thirdly, the critical electric field E c is independent of
λR as in (2.3).
4.1. Inhomogeneous electric field along the x-axis
We apply the electric field E z (x) perpendicularly to a silicene sheet homogeneously in the
y-direction and inhomogeneously in the x-direction. We may set k y = constant due to the
translational invariance along the y-axis. The momentum k y is a good quantum number. Setting
(x, y) = eik y y

we seek the zero-energy solution, where
(x, y) is a four-component amplitude. The
particle–hole symmetry guarantees the existence of zero-energy solutions satisfying the relation
φ B (x) = iξ φ A (x) with ξ = ±1. Here, φ A is a two-component amplitude with the up spin and
the down spin. Then the eigenvalue problem yields
Hη φ A (x) = E ηξ φ A (x),

(4.2)

together with a linear dispersion relation
E ηξ = ηξ h¯ vF k y .

The equation of motion for φ A (x) reads
(ξ h¯ vF ∂x + ηλSO σz − E z (x)) φ A (x) = 0.

This is reminiscent of the Jackiw–Rebbi mode [20] proposed for the chiral mode.
The difference between the chiral and helical modes is the presence of the spin factor
sz in the wave function. As we shall see explicitly in some examples in what follows, we find
the condition either ηsz = 1 or ηsz = −1 for convergence of the wave function. The condition
ηsz = 1 implies that the spin is up (sz = 1) at the K point (η = 1) and that the spin is down
(sz = −1) at the K point (η = −1). Consequently, the up-spin electrons flow into the positive
x-direction, while the down-spin electrons flow into the negative x-direction, implying that
the pure spin current flows into the positive x-direction. On the other hand, the condition
ηsz = −1 implies that the pure spin current flows into the negative x-direction.

and ηsz = −1 along the other line: the spin currents flow in the opposite directions along
these two lines, sandwiched by a band insulator (|x| > λSO /|α|) and a topological insulator
(|x| < λSO /|α|). We illustrate the probability density |φAsz (x)|2 in figure 5(a) in the case of
α > 0. Each line may be used as a quantum wire.

which implies that the current is helical in the metallic region. We illustrate the probability
density |φ A↑ (x)|2 in figure 5(b) in the case of α > 0, which is a constant for x 0.
It is intriguing that helical zero modes emerge in metal. This is not surprising because the
edge of a topological insulator is a sufficient but not a necessary condition for the emergence
of helical zero modes. The helical zero mode requires the massless Dirac fermion, the timereversal symmetry and the SO interaction. Our example shows explicitly that it can also
appear in regions other than the edge of a topological insulator provided these conditions are
satisfied.

convergence of the wave function, the current is helical in the metallic region (r R). We show
the probability density |φ A↑ (r )|2 in figure 6(b), where φ A↑ (r ) = constant for r R. This region
may act as a quantum dot.
5. Conclusions

Taking advantage of the buckled structure of silicene, we have demonstrated that we can control
its band structure by applying the electric field E z . Silicene undergoes a topological phase
transition between a topological insulator and a band insulator as E z crosses the critical point
±E c . It is a semimetal at E z = ±E c .
A novel phenomenon appears when we apply an inhomogeneous electric field. We have
explicitly constructed wave functions of helical zero modes for simple geometrical regions
based on the low-energy effective Dirac theory. The results imply, in general, that helical zero
modes can be confined in any regions by tuning the external electric field locally to the critical
field (2.3), E z (x, y) = E c . Our system may be the first example in which helical zero modes
appear also in regions other than the edge of a topological insulator. It is to be emphasized that
we can apply an inhomogeneous electric field so that a single silicene sheet contains several
regions which are topological insulators, band insulators and metals. Such a structure may open
the way for future spintronics. Our results are also applicable to germanene, a 2D honeycomb
structure made of germanium.
