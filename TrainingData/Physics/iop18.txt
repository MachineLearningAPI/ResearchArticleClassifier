In this paper, we describe a general optomechanical system for
converting photons to phonons in an efficient and reversible manner. We analyze
classically and quantum mechanically the conversion process and proceed to a
more concrete description of a phonon–photon translator (PPT) formed from
coupled photonic and phononic crystal planar circuits. The application of the
PPT to RF-microwave photonics and circuit QED, including proposals utilizing
this system for optical wavelength conversion, long-lived quantum memory and
state transfer from optical to superconducting qubits, is considered.

1. Introduction

Classical and quantum information processing network architectures utilize light (optical
photons) for the transmission of information over extended distances, ranging from hundreds
of meters to hundreds of kilometers [1, 2]. The utility of optical photons stems from their weak
interaction with the environment, large bandwidth of transmission and resilience to thermal
noise due to their high frequency (∼200 THz). Acoustic excitations (phonons), although limited
in terms of bandwidth and their ability to transmit information farther than a few millimeters,
can be delayed and stored for significantly longer times and can interact resonantly with RFmicrowave electronic systems [3]. This complimentary nature of photons and phonons suggests
hybrid phononic–photonic systems as a fruitful avenue of research, where a new class of
optomechanical circuitry could be made to perform a range of tasks out of the reach of purely
photonic and phononic systems. A building block of such a hybrid architecture would be
elements coherently interfacing optical and acoustic circuits. The optomechanical translator we
propose in this paper acts as a chip-scale transparent, coherent interface between phonons and
photons and fulfills a key requirement in such a program.
In the quantum realm, systems involving optical, superconducting, spin or charge
qubits coupled to mechanical degrees of freedom [4]–[9] have been explored. The recent
demonstration of coherent coupling between a superconducting qubit and a mechanical
resonance by O’Connell et al [10] has provided an experimental backing for this vision and
is the latest testament to the versatility of mechanics as a connecting element in hybrid quantum
systems. In the specific case of phonon–photon state transfer, systems involving trapped atoms,
ions, nanospheres [11]–[15] and mechanically compliant optical cavity structures [16] have

all been considered. In these previous studies, the state of an incoming light field is usually
mapped onto the motional state of an atom, ion or macroscopic mirror through an exact timing
of control pulses, turning the interaction on and off between the light and mechanical motion in
a precise way. The ability to simultaneously implement phononic and photonic waveguides
in optomechanical crystal (OMC) structures [17] opens up the opportunity to implement
a traveling-wave phonon–photon translator (PPT). Such a device, operating continuously,
connects acoustic and optical waves to each other in a symmetric manner and allows for on-thefly conversion between phonons and photons without having to precisely time the information
and control pulses. In effect, the problem of engineering control pulses is converted into a
problem of engineering coupling rates.
Our proposal for a PPT is motivated strongly by recent work [18, 19] on radiation
pressure effects in micro- and nano-scale mechanical systems [20]–[26]. Furthermore, the
concrete realization of a PPT is aided by the considerable advances made in the last decade
in the theory, design and engineering of thin-film artificial quasi-2D (patterned membrane)
crystal structures containing photonic [27]–[32] and phononic [33]–[37] ‘bandgaps’. Such
systems promise unprecedented control over photons and phonons and have been separately
subjected to extensive investigation. Their unification, in the form of OMCs that possess a
simultaneous phononic and photonic bandgap [17], [38]–[41] and in which the interaction
between the photons and phonons can be controlled, promises to further expand the capabilities
of both photonic and phononic architectures and forms the basis for the proposed PPT
implementation.
An outline of this paper is as follows. In sections 2 and 3, we introduce and study the PPT
system as an abstraction, at first classically and then quantum mechanically. After introducing
the basic system, its properties and its scattering matrix, we study the effects of quantum and
classical noises on device operation. In section 4, we design and simulate a possible physical
implementation of the system, utilizing recent results for simultaneous phononic–photonic
bandgap materials [39]. Finally, in section 5, we demonstrate a few possible applications of
the PPT. Focusing first on ‘classical’ applications, we evaluate the performance of the PPT
when used for the implementation of an optical delay line and wavelength converter. Finally,
we show how such a system could be used in theory to carry out high-fidelity quantum state
transfer between optical and superconducting qubits.
2. Outline of the proposed system

The proposed PPT system, shown in figure 1, consists of a localized mechanical resonance (b)
which couples the two optical resonances (a1 , a2 ) of an optomechanical cavity via radiation
pressure. External coupling to and from the mechanical resonance is provided by an acoustic
waveguide, while each of the optical resonances is coupled via separate optical waveguides.
Multi-optical-mode optomechanical systems have been proposed and experimentally studied
previously in the context of enhancing quantum back-action, reduced lasing threshold and
parametric instabilities [42]–[48]. Here we use a two-moded optical cavity because it allows
for the spatial filtering and separation of signal and pump optical beams while reducing the
required input power, as explained below.
A general description of the radiation–pressure coupling of the mechanical and optical
degrees of freedom in such a structure is as follows. For each of the two high-Q
optical resonances of the cavity, we associate an annihilation operator aˆk and a frequency

ωk (k = 1, 2). Geometric deformation of the optomechanical cavity parameterized by x changes
the frequencies of the optical modes by gk (x). The deformation, due to the localized mechanical
resonance with annihilation operator bˆ and frequency , can be quantized and given by
xˆ = xZPF (bˆ + bˆ† ). There is also a coupling between the two optical cavity modes given by h(x),
where for resonant intermodal mechanical coupling the cavity structure must be engineered
such that = ω2 − ω1 . In a traveling-wave PPT device consisting of the two optical cavity
resonances and a single mechanical resonance, the lower frequency cavity mode (a1 in this case)
is used as a ‘pump’ cavity, which enables the inter-conversion of phonons in the mechanical
resonance (b) to photons in the second, higher frequency, optical cavity mode (a2 ) through
a two-photon process in which pump photons are either absorbed or emitted as needed. The
‘signals’ representing the phonon and photon quanta to be exchanged will thus be contained in
b and a1 , respectively.
As described, the Hamiltonian of this system is
Hˆ = h¯ ω1 aˆ†1 aˆ1 + h¯ ω2 aˆ†2 aˆ2 + h¯ bˆ† bˆ + h¯ (g1 (x)

where we have added a classical optical pumping term of electric field amplitude E pump and
frequency ω L . Optical pumping is performed through one of the optical waveguides with (field)
coupling rate to the a1 cavity resonance given by κ1,e . In addition to the waveguide loading of
each optical resonance (κk,e ), the total optical loss rate of each cavity mode includes an intrinsic
component (κk,i ) of field decay due to radiation, scattering and absorption. Similarly, for the
mechanical resonance, we have a field decay rate given by γ = γe + γi , which is a combination
of waveguide loading and intrinsic losses. The constant parts of both h(x)
ˆ and gk (x)
ˆ (h(0),
gk (0)) can be eliminated by a change of basis and are thus taken to be zero. As discussed below,
it is advantageous to choose a cavity structure symmetry in which gk (x)
ˆ = 0 up to linear order
in x.
ˆ In fact, we can generally assume that the mechanical displacements are small enough

Figure 2. Optical sidebands and processes for phonon–photon translation. The

optical pump is located on sideband α1,0 , on resonance with the first cavity
mode at frequency ω1 . There are three relevant optical sidebands to consider in
the translation process, α2,+ , α1,0 and α2,− . The inter-sideband photon scattering
gives rise to phonon emission and absorption. The state transfer occurs through
scattering between sidebands α2,+ and α1,0 , whereas inter-sideband scattering
between α1,0 and α2,− can be thought of as phonon noise. Note that for the g = 0
case considered here, there are no sidebands at ω1 ± for cavity mode a1 and
no sidebands at ω1 for mode a2 .
to make the linear order the only important term in the interaction. Assuming then a properly
chosen cavity symmetry,
gk (x)
ˆ = g · (bˆ + bˆ† ) = 0

and

h(x)

which yields a simplified Hamiltonian,

Treating the system classically and approximately, we can write each intracavity photon
and phonon amplitude, and their inputs (see figure 2) as a Fourier decomposition of a few
relevant sidebands,

The equations of motion arrived at from the system Hamiltonian (presented generally in the
following section) then become algebraic relations between the α and β sideband amplitudes.
By ignoring the self-coupling term (g = 0), pumping on-resonance with cavity mode a1 (ω L =
ω1 ), and engineering the optical cavity mode splitting for mechanical resonance (ω2 = ω1 + ),
we arrive at classical sideband amplitudes,

From here we see that the central sideband amplitude of cavity mode a1 , α1,0 is proportional
to the sum of a term containing the pump field E pump and terms containing products of the optical
and mechanical sideband amplitudes. By increasing E pump , the effect of the other sidebands on
the pump resonance amplitude can be made negligible, and we assume here and elsewhere in
this paper that the pump sideband is generally left unaffected by the dynamics of the rest of the
system. As desired, the optical sideband that contains mechanical information is α2,+ because it
is the only sideband directly proportional to β+ . The constant of proportionality between these
two terms is seen to contain both h and α1,0 , demonstrating the role of the pump beam in the
conversion process. Since coherent information transfer between the optics and mechanics is
occurring between β+ and α2,+ , it is desirable to remove the effects of the lower-energy photonic
sideband, α2,− . This sideband can be made significantly smaller in magnitude than α2,+ in the
sideband-resolved regime where
κ. A convenient way to visualize all of the processes
in the system is shown in figure 2, where the photonic sideband amplitudes α2,± and α1,0 are
represented as ‘energy levels’, with transitions between them being due to the emission and
absorption of phonons.
From this approximate analysis, it is clearly suggested that in a sideband resolved
optomechanical system, a state-transfer process is possible between the phononic and photonic
resonances, and the process is controlled by a pump beam [16]. A more in-depth study of the
system dynamics required to understand how such processes may be used for traveling wave
phonon–photon conversion, and a full investigation of all relevant noise sources required to
understand the applicability of such a system to quantum information, is carried out in the
following section.

3. Analysis

A detailed treatment of the operation of a traveling PPT is carried out in this section. At first, the
dynamics of the system are simplified while still taking into account the noise processes related
to the sideband α2,− . In this way, one is left with an effective ‘beam-splitter’ Hamiltonian, which
describes the coherent interaction between the optics and mechanics, while the aforementioned
noise processes are accounted for through an effective increase in the thermal bath temperature.
This is followed by a treatment of the traveling-wave problem through a scattering matrix
formulation, which provides an insight into the role of the intracavity pump photon number
(|α1,0 |2 ) and optimizing the state-transfer efficiency.
3.1. Simplified dynamics of the system
Starting from the Hamiltonian in equation (2), a set of Heisenberg–Langevin equations can be
written down [49],
aˆ˙ 1 = −(κ1 + iω1 )aˆ1 − ih(bˆ + bˆ† )aˆ2 + 2κ1,e E pump e−iωL t − 2κ1 aˆ1,in ,
(15)
a˙ˆ 2 = −(κ2 + iω2 )aˆ2 − ih(bˆ + bˆ† )aˆ1 − 2κ2 aˆ2,in ,

(16)

˙
bˆ = −i bˆ − ih aˆ†2 aˆ1 + aˆ†1 aˆ2 − γ bˆ + γ bˆ† − 2γ bˆin .

(17)

The input coupling terms as written above include both external waveguide coupling and
intrinsic coupling due to lossy channels (see figure 1). Separated, the intrinsic (with subscript i)
and extrinsic (with no subscript) components look as follows,
2κk aˆk,in =
2γ bˆin =

2κk,e aˆk,in + 2κk,i aˆk,in,i ,

(18)

2γ bˆin + 2γi bˆin,i ,

(19)

κk = κk,i + κk,e ,

(20)

γ = γi + γe .

(21)

As the fluctuations in the fields are of primary interest, each Heisenberg operator can be
rewritten as a fluctuation term around a steady-state value,
aˆ1 (t) → (α1 + aˆ1 ) e−iω1 t ,

(22)

aˆ2 (t) → (α2 + aˆ2 ) e−iω2 t ,

(23)

ˆ → (β + b)
ˆ e−i t .
b(t)

(24)

Assuming that the pump beam is driven resonantly with a1 (ω L = ω1 ), the c-number steady-state
values are equal to (α1 , α2 , β) = (( 2κ1,e /κ)E pump , 0, 0).
For the fluctuation dynamics, with ≡ (ω2 − ω1 ) − , the resulting equations are
√

Ignoring all of the mechanically anti-resonant terms for now and invoking the rotating wave
approximation (RWA) valid when
and
|α1 |h, we arrive at the simplified set of
fluctuation equations,
√
aˆ˙1 = −κ1 aˆ1 − ih aˆ2 bˆ† e−i t − 2κ aˆ eiω1 t ,

˙
bˆ = −γ bˆ − ih(α˜ 1 + aˆ1 )† aˆ2 e−i t − 2γ bˆin ei t .

(29)
(30)

By ignoring all of the counter-rotating terms proportional to e+i2 t , we have also neglected
the noise processes alluded to previously due to the α2,− sideband. Of the mechanically
anti-resonant terms that have been dropped, the terms proportional to α1 (hα1 bˆ† e+i2 t in
equation (26) and hα1 aˆ†2 e+i2 t in equation (27)) are the largest and most significant in terms
of error in RWA. These terms correspond to aˆ1 aˆ†2 bˆ† + h.c. in the Hamiltonian and cause intersideband photon scattering between the pump, α1,0 , and its lower frequency sideband, α2,− , as
shown in figure 2. This inter-sideband scattering process causes the emission and absorption of
phonons in the mechanical part of the PPT; thus, in principle, even when the extrinsic phonon
inputs are in the vacuum state, spontaneous scattering of photons from α1,0 to α2,− may populate
the mechanical cavity with a phonon.
This effect was studied in [50, 51] in the context of quantum limits to optomechanical
cooling. Similar to that work, a master equation for the phononic mode with the ω1 − optical
sideband adiabatically eliminated leads to an additional phononic spontaneous emission term
given by
ρ˙ b,spon =

where G = h|α˜ ss
1 |. The master equation for the mechanics, found by tracing over all bath
and optical variables, is of the form ρ˙ = ρ˙ b,i + ρ˙ b,spon + ρ˙ b,e − i/h¯ [Hb , ρ], where the terms on
the right-hand side of the equation are, respectively, the intrinsic phononic loss, the phonon
spontaneous emission, the phonon–waveguide coupling and the coherent evolution of the
system. The first two terms can be lumped together into an effective intrinsic loss, ρ˙ b,i =

mechanics. Note that it is possible in this model to have γi negative when n spon > 1; however,
the motional decoherence rate is always positive and given by γi n¯ = γi (n¯ + n spon ).
In section 3.2, we will see that the optimal state-transfer efficiency is given by2 G 2 = γ κ,

in the sideband resolved limit. In the case where g = 0 (recall that this is the self-coupling
radiation pressure term), photons scattering from the pump into the lower-frequency sideband
(ω1 − ) can scatter into the a1 cavity mode, which is only detuned by . This is to be compared
with the g = 0 case considered so far in which the detuning is 2 for scattering into the a2 mode.
As such, for the g = 0 case, there will be roughly four times the spontaneous emission noise,
g=0

A final simplification can be made by neglecting the fluctuations in the strong optical pump
of cavity mode a1 . Considering that the fluctuations in the variables are all of the same order
and that aˆ1 always appears as α1 + aˆ1 in the equations of motion for bˆ and aˆ2 , we can ignore
the dynamics of the pump fluctuations in the case where |α1 |
aˆ 1 , aˆ2 and bˆ . This is the
undepleted pump approximation. Adiabatically removing the pump from the dynamics of the
system yields a pump-enhanced optomechanical coupling G = h|α1 | between the optical cavity
mode a2 and the mechanical resonance b. Dropping the subscript from the cavity mode a2 and
moving to a rotating reference frame results in the new effective Hamiltonian [16],
Hˆ eff = − bˆ† bˆ + G aˆ† bˆ + G ∗ aˆbˆ† .

The system diagram and symbol corresponding to this simplified model of the PPT are shown
in figure 3.
3.2. Scattering matrix formulation of the phonon–photon translator (PPT)
To understand the properties of the PPT as a waveguide adapter, we begin with a study
of its scattering matrix. Starting from the effective Hamiltonian given in equation (37), the
The γ in this case is in principle γe + γi as opposed to γe + γi , and the equations must therefore be solved
self-consistently. This is discussed in section 3.2.1.

The intrinsic noise terms a˜in,i (ω) and b˜in,i (ω) are the initial-state boson annihilation operators for
the baths, whereas the extrinsic terms a˜in (ω) and b˜in (ω) are annihilation operators for the optical
and mechanical guided modes for each respective waveguide. Since the effective Hamiltonian
(37) has been used to derive equations (38) and (39), thereby neglecting the counter-rotating
terms present in the full system dynamics, the effects of phonon spontaneous emission noise
is included separately. Following the discussion in section 3.1, the effective Liouvillian (32)
corresponds to replacing γi with γi in (39) and using a Langevin force b˜in,i (ω) satisfying the
relations
b˜†in,i (ω)b˜in,i (ω ) = n¯ δ(ω − ω ),
(40)
b˜in,i (ω )b˜†in,i (ω) = (n¯ + 1)δ(ω − ω ),

where γi and n¯ are given in equations (33) and (34). The intrinsic optical noise correlations are
only due to vacuum fluctuations and given by a˜in,i (ω )a˜†in,i (ω) = δ(ω − ω ).
To ensure efficient translation, competing requirements of matching and strong coupling
between waveguide and resonator must be satisfied. This is similar to the problem of designing
integrated optical filters using resonators and waveguides [52, 53]. From the above equations

Similar expressions are also found for the noise scattering matrix elements n i j (ω), with their
extrema reported below.
In order to obtain efficient conversion, the cavities must be over-coupled to their respective
waveguides, ensuring that the phonon (photon) has a higher chance of leaking into the
waveguide continuum modes than escaping into other loss channels. In this regime, κ ≈ κe and
γ ≈ γe . In the weak-coupling regime, G < κ, the response of the system exhibits a maximum
for s12 and s21 at ω = 0 and a minimum at the same point for s11 and s22 . In fact, with realistic
system parameters, only the weak-coupling regime leads to efficient translation. In the strongcoupling regime (G > κ and κ
γ ), the photon is converted to a phonon at the rate G and
then back to a photon before it has a chance of leaving through the much slower phononic loss
channel at rate γ , causing there to be significant reflections and reduced conversion efficiency.
To find the optimal value of G, we consider the extrema given by

In the over-coupled approximation and in the case where κi = γi = 0, it is easy to see that the
full translation condition |s12 |max = 1 is achievable by setting G equal to
√
G o = γ κ.
(51)
This result has a simple interpretation as a matching requirement. The photonic loss channel
viewed from the phononic mode has a loss rate of G 2 /κ. Matching this to the purely mechanical
√
loss rate of the same phononic mode, γ , one arrives at G o = γ κ. The same argument can be
used for the photonic mode, giving the same result. Under this matched condition, the linewidth
of the translation peak in |s12 |2 is simply

With intrinsic losses taken into account, either |s11 | or |s22 | (but not both) can be made

peak of |s21 |2 shown in figure 4(d). A similar reflection dip and transmission peak is visible
for the phononic reflection (s22 ) and phonon-to-photon translation (s12 ) curves. It can also
be noted from figure 4 that for small detunings
of the system ( < κ, ), the resonant
scattering matrix elements are only weakly affected and the translation process maintains its
efficiency.
3.2.1. Modifications to the matching condition due to counter-rotating terms. As a
consequence of the counter-rotating terms treated in Section 3.1, γ is weakly dependent on
G. In particular, by making the substitution γi → γi , where γi is given by equation (33), the
o 2
equation for the optimal G becomes |Gκ | = γe + γi , where γi is itself dependent on G. Algebraic
manipulations give us the desired value of G,

simplifying in the sideband-resolved limit to G o = γ κ(1 − ( 2κ )2 ). The values for the
scattering matrix elements given in equations (53)–(59) are also suitably modified by the
substitutions γi → γi and γ → γe + γi .
3.2.2. Phononic waveguide losses. The issue of waveguide loss is one that is normally ignored
in quantum optical systems where low-loss fiber or free-space links are readily available. On
the phononic side of the systems studied here, the length of the waveguide and its intrinsic
losses may be large enough for the waveguide attenuation factor to become important. Because
of the negative effect of attenuation in applications involving optomechanical delay lines, and
quantum state transfer, it is useful to model this loss and see how the scattering matrix elements
are altered.
A model of the system is shown in figure 5(b), where the lossy waveguide is replaced
by a single beam splitter. This is accomplished by first modeling the lossy waveguide as a
large number N of cascaded beam splitters, each reflecting 2α z away from the main beam,
with L = z N . This serial array of beam splitters can be combined into one, with reflectivity

η = e−2αL as N → ∞. The relation for dˆ out can be found by starting from the approximate
scattering matrix relation for bˆout ,
bˆout (t) = s21 aˆin (t) + s22 bˆin (t) + n 12 aˆin,i (t) + n 22 bˆin,i (t),

√
dˆ out (t) = η bout + 1 − η bwg,i,1 ,

(62)

√
bˆin (t) = η din + 1 − η bwg,i,2 .

(63)

Assuming that the phonon cavity intrinsic loss bath is at the same temperature and uncorrelated
with the phonon waveguide intrinsic loss baths, one finds for translation through the lossy
phonon waveguide
dˆ out (t) = s21 aˆin (t) + s22 dˆ in (t) + n 12 aˆin,i (t) + n 22 bˆin,i (t),

3.3. Effects of thermal and quantum noises
In general, the type of noise that is relevant to the PPT depends on the conditions in which it
is used. For example, when used as a bridge between RF-microwave photonics and optics for
classical applications at room temperature, the thermal noise affecting the RF signal will be at a
level which makes the quantum noise induced by spontaneous pump scattering irrelevant. On the
other hand, when the system is used at cryogenic temperatures for connecting a superconducting
circuit QED system to an optical system as described below, the quantum noise of the translation
process itself becomes dominant. In what follows, we analyze both sources of noise.
3.3.1. Thermal noise on the optical side. The noise power on each of the output waveguide
channels can be found by using the scattering matrix formulation described in section 3.2. Here,
we evaluate the effects of thermal noise classically. When the system is used as an optical drop
filter, in which an optical beam is sent in and the optical reflection is measured, we find
aout (t) = s11 (t) ∗ ain (t) + s12 (t) ∗ bin (t) + n 11 (t) ∗ ain,i (t) + n 12 (t) ∗ bin,i (t),
New Journal of Physics 13 (2011) 013017 (http://www.njp.org/)

(69)

15
where ∗ represents convolution. Assuming that there are no cross-correlations between the
various input noise terms, we find the classical spectral density of the noise to be
Sout (ω) = |s12 (ω)|2 n¯ + |n 12 (ω)|2 (n¯ + n spon ).

(70)

For a system with mechanical frequency less than 10 GHz, at room temperature (T = 300 K) the
corresponding spontaneous emission noise is much less than the thermal noise, n spon n¯ ≈ 103 ,
and n spon can be ignored.
Ignoring the quantum noise term for the moment, and evaluating equation (70) at ω = 0
after substituting in equations (56)–(59), the total thermal noise power on the reflected optical
signal is found to be
N
Po,out
= h¯ ω2 n¯

κe
π B,
κ

(71)

where B = 2γ is the bandwidth of the PPT. In the classical regime, n¯ = kTbath /(h¯ ), and this
N
equation reduces to Po,out
= 2π γ kT bath (ω2 / )(κe /κ). This result has a simple interpretation.
The noise power π γ kT bath is the standard thermal noise input on the phononic side of
the PPT. The ratio ω2 / is a translation factor, arising from the fact that quantum-limited
conversion of phonons to photons causes an increase in energy by the factor of the ratio of
their frequencies. Finally, the factor κe /κ is the extraction efficiency of photons from the optical
mode to the waveguide. Alternatively, one may define an equivalent optical temperature by
N
setting πκe kT o,eff = Po,out
, yielding To,eff = (2Q o /Q m )Tbath , where the Qs represent the loaded
quality factors of the optical and mechanical resonators. This last expression must be interpreted
carefully, only in terms of a power equivalence, as spectrally the noise on the optical side of
the PPT has a bandwidth of 2γ , while thermal noise radiating from the cavity would have a
bandwidth of κ.
3.3.2. Phonon spontaneous emission noise. To calculate the effective increase in noise brought
about by the spontaneous pump scattering and phonon emission process, we start from
equation (70) and use the spontaneous emission contribution n spon to find
N

(72)

The second term in the brackets is due to the spontaneous emission of phonons by the optical

of an effective contribution to the thermal photon occupation number, the spontaneous pump
scattering effectively adds

thermal photons to the cavity. This equivalence is only in terms of total noise power emitted,
as spectrally the noise is emitted over the 2γ bandwidth of the PPT resonance, not the entire
optical cavity resonance, as discussed above.

4. Proposed on-chip implementation

Up to this point in the analysis of the PPT, the discussion has been kept as general as possible.
Such a system is, however, interesting only insofar as it is realizable, and we attempt here
to establish the practicality of a PPT. Building upon recent experimental [17] and theoretical
works [38, 39], we provide the design of an OMC formed in a silicon microchip that can realize
a PPT system with high phonon-photon translation efficiency.
As previously mentioned, OMCs [17] are engineered structures in which phonons and
photons may be independently routed and their interactions controlled. In order to create a
suitable OMC structure for the implementation of a PPT device, one looks to a crystal lattice
providing simultaneous phononic and photonic bandgaps for the guiding and co-localization
of phonons and photons [55]. We have recently proposed [39] such an OMC system, formed
from a silicon-on-insulator wafer and consisting of a patterned thin membrane of silicon. The
proposed ‘snowflake’ crystal lattice supports a phononic bandgap in the 5–10 GHz mechanical
frequency band and a photonic bandgap in the 1500 nm optical wavelength band. This quasi2D crystal structure was also shown to support low-loss photonic and phononic waveguides,
optical resonances with radiation-limited Q > 106 co-localized with mechanical resonances
of frequency ≈ 2π × 10 GHz and a single quanta optomechanical interaction rate of g ≈
2π × 300 kHz.
In this section, we design an example OMC implementation of a PPT in the silicon
snowflake crystal. We limit ourselves here to a two-dimensional (2D) crystal involving only 2D
Maxwell’s equations for transverse-electric (TE) polarized optical waves and in-plane elastic
deformations of an infinitely thick slab. This simplifies the analysis and avoids some of the
technical challenges related to achieving high optical Qs in a quasi-2D thin film structure,
challenges which have already been studied and met elsewhere [31, 39, 56].
4.1. Single and double cavity systems
The snowflake crystal consists of a hexagonal lattice of snowflake-shaped holes patterned
into silicon, as shown in figure 6. The snowflake lattice used here is characterized by a
lattice constant a = 400 nm, snowflake radius r = 168 nm, and width w = 60 nm. It possesses
a full phononic bandgap from 8.6 to 12.6 GHz and a photonic pseudo-bandgap for TE optical
waves from 180 to 230 THz. Defects in the crystal (features breaking the discrete translational
symmetry of the underlying lattice) can support resonances with frequencies within the optical
and mechanical bandgaps, leading to highly localized, strongly interacting resonances [39]. As
an example, by filling an adjacent pair of snowflake-shaped holes in the crystal, a so-called
‘L2’ cavity is formed that supports a localized photonic resonance at a frequency νo = 199 THz
and a phononic resonance at a frequency νm = 11.2 GHz. The defect cavity structure and finiteelement method (FEM) [57] simulated field profiles of these co-localized modes are shown in
figures 6(a) and (f).
The L2 cavity forms the basis of a more complex double-optical-mode cavity structure
with the desired symmetry properties for efficient phonon-to-photon translation. By placing two
separate L2 cavities close to one another, at sufficiently small separations, even and odd optical
and mechanical super-modes form with split mechanical and optical resonant frequencies. We
choose to displace the cavities from each other in the y-direction, as shown in a full system
diagram in figure 7. These super-modes of the coupled cavities are characterized with respect

nearly identical to the mechanical mode frequency of νm = 11.2 GHz, as ascertained by FEM
simulations. We focus here only on the mechanical mode of odd vector symmetry, Q− , since,
as we will show below, this is the mode that cross-couples the two optical super-modes to each
other.

4.2. Optomechanical coupling rates
Optomechanical coupling (or acousto-optic scattering) arises from the coupling of optical
cavity modes under deformations in the geometric structure. In the canonical form of radiation
pressure, a mechanical deformation in the cavity induces a shift in the resonance frequency of
a given cavity mode. The coefficient describing the cavity mode dispersion with mechanical
displacement also quantifies the strength of the radiation pressure force that photons in the
cavity mode exert back on the mechanical structure. More generally, mechanical deformations
may couple one optical cavity mode to another.
The self-coupling and inter-modal couplings caused by a mechanical deformation are
modeled by the position-dependent interaction rates gk (x)
ˆ and h(x),
ˆ respectively, in the
Hamiltonian of equation (1). Both types of deformation-dependent optomechanical couplings
may be calculated to first order using a variant of the Feynman–Hellmann perturbation
theory, the Johnson perturbation theory [59], which takes into account moving boundaries in
electromagnetic cavities and has been used successfully in the past to model OMC cavities
[17, 38]. The Hamiltonian, given to first order by

where E, D, Q and t are the optical mode electric field, optical mode displacement field
mechanical mode displacement field and the thickness of the slab or thin film, respectively. For
convenience, in what follows, we denote the overlap integral in equation (76) as Ei |Q|E j .
Since the optical super-modes are nearly degenerate, we replace ωi, j with either ω+ or ω−
with little error, and following the notation used previously, denote cross-modal coupling as
h = g+,− = g−,+ .
For the optical and mechanical modes of a single L2 cavity (see figures 6(a) and (f)), the
optomechanical self-coupling is numerically calculated using (76) to be g = E|Q|E /2π =
489 kHz. Then, using the symmetry selection rules in the overlap integrals, the only coupling
terms involving the Q− mode are the cross-coupling terms
E± |Q− |E∓ . These terms are
√
calculated to be E+ |Q− |E− = E− |Q− |E+ = E|Q|E / 2 to good approximation. For the
super-modes of our double L2 cavity system, this yields a cross-coupling rate of h/2π =
346 kHz.
4.3. Implementation of waveguides
A line defect on an OMC acts as a waveguide for light and sound [60]–[62]. In principle then,
the same waveguide may be used to shuttle both the photons and the phonons around on an
OMC microchip. However, due to the different properties of optical and acoustic excitations, in
particular, their typically disparate quality factors (roughly 106 for 200 THz photons and 104
for GHz phonons in silicon), the cavity loading requirements may be different for photons
and phonons. As such, it is more convenient to implement two physically separate sets of
waveguides, one for optics and the other for mechanics.
New Journal of Physics 13 (2011) 013017 (http://www.njp.org/)

20
Our chosen line defect for optical waveguiding, shown in figure 6(b), consists of a row of
removed holes, with the rows above and below shifted toward one another
√ by W such that the
distance between the centers of the snowflakes across the line defect is 3a − 2W . Simulations
of this line defect waveguide show that there are no acoustic waveguide bands resonant with
the localized mechanical L2 cavity modes of interest (see figure 6(c)) and therefore that this
waveguide will not load the mechanical part of the L2 cavity system. Optically, this line
defect has a single optical band crossing the frequencies of the localized optical L2 cavity
modes of interest (see figure 6(d)), providing the single-mode optical waveguiding required for
the PPT.
The line defect used for the acoustic waveguide consists of a row of holes which have
been reduced in size, as shown in figure 6(g). By shrinking the size of the central row of
snowflake holes by 18%, a single-mode acoustic waveguide is formed which spectrally overlaps
the localized mechanical resonances of the L2 cavity (see figure 6(h)) and allows for mechanical
coupling to the PPT. This same line defect waveguide is reflective for optical photons in the band
of localized optical resonances of the L2 cavity (see figure 6(i)) and thus is isolated from the
optical part of the PPT. Below we discuss how both the optical and the mechanical waveguides
may be used to load the PPT resonant cavity.
4.4. Cavity–waveguide coupling
By bringing the optical waveguide near the L2 cavity, the optical cavity resonance is
evanescently coupled to the guided modes of the line defect, as shown in figure 7(b). Control
over this coupling rate is achieved at a coarse level by changing the distance (number of unit
cells) between the cavity and the waveguide. For the structure considered here, a gap of eight
rows is sufficient to achieve a coupling rate κe in the desired range. A fine-tuning of the coupling
rate is accomplished by adjusting the waveguide width parameter, with a value of W = 0.135a
resulting in a loaded optical cavity Q-factor of Q WG,o ≈ 3 × 105 (the corresponding external
waveguide coupling rate is κe /2π = 300 MHz). Considering that intrinsic optical Q-factors as
high as 3 × 106 have been achieved in microfabricated thin-film silicon photonic crystal cavities
similar to the sort studied here [63], the calculated optical waveguide loading should put such a
cavity structure well into the over-coupled regime (κe /κi ≈ 10). A short section in which W is
tapered is used to close off the waveguide on one side.
The same design procedure for the acoustic waveguide results in an evanescently coupled
waveguide at a distance of only one row from the L2 cavity. Since the acoustic line-defect
waveguide does not support Bloch modes at the optical cavity frequency, no additional loss
is calculated for the optical cavity resonance. In this geometry, the mechanical cavity loading
is calculated to be Q WG,m = 1.3 × 103 , corresponding to an extrinsic coupling rate γe /2π =
4.4 MHz. Taking Q i ≈ 104 as an achievable intrinsic mechanical Q-factor, such a loading also
puts the mechanical system in the over-coupling regime (γe /γi ≈ 10).
Simulations of the above cavity–waveguide couplings are performed using FEM [57] with
absorbing boundaries at the ends of the waveguide. The resulting time-average electromagnetic
Poynting vector | So t |2 = |E × H∗ |/2 of the optical field leaking from the L2 optical cavity
resonance is plotted in figure 7(b), while the mechanical Poynting vector | Sm t |2 = | − v · T|2 (v
is the velocity field and T the stress tensor) of the acoustic waves radiating from the mechanical
mode of the L2 cavity is shown in figure 7(c). It is readily apparent from these two plots that the
coupling of the two different waveguides to the L2 cavity acts as desired; the acoustic radiation

is coupled only to the phononic waveguide, and the optical radiation is coupled only to the
photonic waveguide.
In order to individually address and out-couple from the even and odd symmetry cavity
resonances of double-L2-cavity structure used to form the PPT, a pair of waveguides is used for
each of the optical and mechanical couplings. As shown in the overall PPT design of figure 7(a),
each of the L2 cavities has an acoustic and an optical waveguide coupled to them. Excitation of
a pair of waveguides either in or out of phase would thus allow for coupling to the symmetric
or anti-symmetric super-modes, respectively, of the double-L2 cavity. Similarly, spatial filtering
(via an integrated directional coupler or waveguide filter for instance) of the output of a pair of
waveguides would allow for the selective readout of either the symmetric or anti-symmetric
cavity modes. One could, in principle, utilize spectral filtering to perform the selective
mode coupling; however, with the narrowband nature of the optical and mechanical supermode splittings, spatially independent channels of excitation and readout may be a preferred
option.
In summary, the OMC PPT as designed couples the symmetric and anti-symmetric optical
modes of a double-L2-cavity system via a co-localized anti-symmetric mechanical resonance
at the frequency νm = 11.2 GHz. In the notation of section 3, the lower-frequency symmetric
optical mode is the pump mode (cavity mode a1 ), the anti-symmetric mode is the signal mode
or cavity mode a2 and the anti-symmetric mechanical resonance is phonon mode b. Both
optical modes are designed to have a resonant frequency in the near-IR around a frequency
of 200 THz, with a frequency splitting engineered to be equal to the mechanical frequency,
ω− − ω+ ≈ = 2π × 11.2 GHz. The numerically calculated waveguide and optomechanical
coupling rates for this system are (κe , γe , h) = 2π × (300, 4.4, 0.35) MHz, with the required
√
number of intracavity pump photons for optimum operation (G ≈ κe γe ) of such a PPT
estimated to be only |α1,0 |2 = 1.1 × 104 (assuming minimal intrinsic losses and κe ≈ κ, γe ≈ γ ).
5. Applications

At the simplest level, the extremely narrow optical response of the PPT, as shown in figure 4,
provides the opportunity for design and fabrication of filters with MHz-scale linewidths in the
optical domain. By comparison, a purely passive optical design would require optical cavities
with quality factors of Q ≈ 108 . More generally, such a scheme demonstrates a promising aspect
of optomechanics in the realm of optical information processing. In this section, three example
applications of the PPT are studied in detail. The first two, optical delay lines and wavelength
converters, are further examples of optical information processing that are of considerable
interest in both classical and quantum information processing. The last application, using
the PPT to provide optical ‘flying qubit’ capability to superconducting microwave quantum
systems, is an example of how optomechanics can have a fundamental role in hybrid quantum
system engineering.
5.1. Delay lines
Efficient reversible conversion between traveling photons and phonons can be used to realize an
optical delay line, as shown schematically in figure 8. In this geometry, the acoustic waveguide
used to extract phonons from the PPT is terminated abruptly, forming an effective acoustic
wave mirror which reflects phonons back toward the PPT after some propagation distance and

optical delay line/filter configuration in which a phonon mirror at the end of the
acoustic output reflects outgoing phonons back into the PPT. The large optical
delay is afforded by the acoustic path length of the signal in which acoustic
waves propagate some 105 times more slowly than photons. Optical filtering is
provided by the narrow resonance bandwidth of the mechanical component of
the PPT.

delay. Resonant photons sent into the optical port of the PPT will then re-emerge, reflected
and delayed by twice the length of the acoustic waveguide. The delay line functionality
comes from the inherent slowness of acoustic waves in comparison to electromagnetic waves
(roughly a factor of 105 for waves in silicon). For a similar reason, electro-acoustic piezoelectric
structures are used to create the chip-scale RF-microwave filters found in many compact
wireless communication devices [64].
The usefulness and bounds on the main characteristics of a PPT-based delay line, i.e.
the total delay possible and the delay–bandwidth product, may be simply estimated without
referring to a particular implementation of the system. The maximum possible delay is given by
the lifetime of an excitation on the mechanical side of the system (cavity and waveguide) and is
given by 1/γi , which is limited by material properties of the mechanical system. The bandwidth
of PPT conversion is given by equation (52) and is the total loss rate seen by the mechanical
resonance, 2γ . As such, the delay–bandwidth product can at most be
ωτ ∼

2γ
,
γi

(77)

which is approximately twice the acoustic waveguide to mechanical resonance over-coupling
ratio γe /γi in the PPT. Manipulation of the acoustic waves within the delay waveguide
itself, before conversion back to optics, may also be envisioned, enabling existing phononic
information processing capabilities [33] to be applied to optical signals.
5.2. Wavelength conversion
Figure 9(a) shows the schematic diagram for a PPT-based device that can act simultaneously
as a narrowband filter, a delay line and a wavelength converter. It consists of connecting
serially, by a common acoustic waveguide, two PPT devices operating at different optical but
matched mechanical frequencies. Interestingly, if the only goal is to perform photon-to-photon

wavelength conversion, one can omit the connecting acoustic waveguide. By placing the two
PPTs ‘on top of each other’, such that the optical cavities on both PPTs are coupled to the
same mechanical resonance, as shown in figure 9(b), optical wavelength conversion can be
accomplished. Such a PPT geometry could be realized by either having photonic cavities with
multiple modes or using two photonic cavities coupled to the same mechanical mode. Such
photon-to-photon conversion could even be taken to an extreme, allowing, for instance, opticalto-microwave wavelength conversion if one of the photonic cavities is a microwave cavity.
For the simplified wavelength conversion system of figure 9(b), the PPT matching
condition of equation (51) and noise analysis of section 3.3 carry over with only minor
adjustments. For the simplified wavelength conversion system, the thermal noise is now split
between the two optical channels (aˆ and cˆ of figure 9(b)), while the spontaneous emission noise
in the system is approximately doubled (for similar optical cavities) due to the two uncorrelated
spontaneous emission processes occurring from the optical pumping of each individual cavity.
In a single element PPT, the optimal G matches the pure mechanical damping of the mechanical
resonance (γ ) to the induced optomechanical loading of the mechanical resonance (G 2 /κ)
by the optical cavity. The matching condition for the simplified wavelength converter now
must balance a mechanical resonance coupled, on one side, to an optical cavity with induced
mechanical loading rate G a2 /κa and, on the other side, to a second optical cavity with induced
loading rate G 2c /κc . As such, assuming that γi G 2k /κk , we arrive at the photon–photon
converter matching condition

The optomechanical system as described would act as a quantum-limited optomechanical
wavelength converter. Finally, we note that this particular implementation of the wavelength
converter could also function in a wider array of optomechanical platforms since there is no
longer a need for phononic waveguides.

superconducting qubits. The two 3-port components are circulators with each
input connected to the output directly clockwise from it.

5.3. Quantum state transfer and networking between circuit QED and optics
Two of the key requirements for a viable platform for quantum computation are the ability to
store and communicate quantum information. For the case of superconducting phase qubits,
promising theoretical proposals to provide such functionality have involved electrical [65]
and mechanical resonators [4, 5]. Experimentally, an electromagnetic resonator quantum bus
was demonstrated by Sillanpää et al [66] in 2007, while more recently O’Connell et al [10]
demonstrated the strong coupling of a mechanical resonator to a superconducting qubit. Circuit
QED (cQED) to date remains limited by the lack of a true long-range state-transfer mechanism,
one which is readily available for the case of quantum-optical qubits, in the form of optical
fibers and free-space links. Using the PPT system, one could potentially implement a version
of the quantum state-transfer protocol of Cirac et al [67], allowing for the high-fidelity transfer
of states between optical and superconducting qubits. Such a system would satisfy one of the
original goals of a hybrid quantum system [68] by interfacing a quantum optical and solid-state
qubit.
By connecting the phononic waveguide of a PPT to a piezoelectric resonator strongly
coupled to a superconducting qubit [4, 5, 10], and connecting the PPT at its optical end
to an optical cavity QED system, as shown in figure 10, the PPT could be used as an
intermediary in a state-transfer protocol among two energy-disparate quantum systems. The
optical system (A) is composed of a Fabry–Perot cavity containing a three-level atom system
in a configuration. As shown in [67], in the correct limit, this system may be modeled with
an effective Jaynes–Cummings (JC) Hamiltonian with a Rabi frequency g A (t) controlled by
another beam. For the superconducting system (B), a mechanical resonance is coupled to
a phase qubit, with a bias current used to change the frequency of the resultant two-level

25
system, which effectively changes the coupling rate between the qubit and mechanical resonator.
This leads again to a system with an externally controllable Rabi frequency of g B (t). The
Hamiltonian of each subsystem is then given by
Hˆ j = h¯ g j (t)e−iφ j (t) σˆ j cˆ †j + h¯ g j (t)e+iφ j (t) σˆ †j cˆ j

( j = A, B),

(79)

where cˆ j are the annihilation operators of the photonic or phononic resonances external to the
PPT, and σˆ j are the level lowering operators for the respective qubits to which they are coupled.
Each cavity mode, with annihilation operators cˆ j , is coupled to its respective waveguide
with a loss rate j . To characterize the PPT, the intrinsic losses in these cavities are ignored.
Additionally, the phononic waveguide is assumed to be loss-less, although losses may be
taken into account through the minor readjustment of the scattering parameters studied in
section 3.2.2. Using the input–output boundary conditions [49, 54], the frequency domain
expressions for the noise input into systems A and B are found to be
c˜ A,in (ω) = a˜in,c (ω),
c˜ B,in (ω) = s21 (ω)

(80)

(81)
where aˆin,c and bˆin,c represent the noise being coupled into the system from the third input
of each circulator in figure 10. To convert this equation to the time domain, the convolution
between various operators and scattering matrix elements must be taken. If the photon pulse is
of sufficiently large temporal width, i.e. with bandwidth less than the bandwidth of the PPT, the
frequency dependence of each scattering matrix element can be removed, replacing it with its
extremal value assuming that the system is operating at resonance ( = 0). This requires that
the coupling rates g j (t) should change slowly relative to the response of the PPT. Under this
condition, the input–output relations in the time domain are then
cˆ A,in (t) = aˆin,c (t),
cˆ B,in (t) = s21

In modeling the noise of the system, it is assumed that the optical noise inputs are in the vacuum
state and that the phononic noise is thermal with thermal phonon occupation numbers n¯ and
n¯ for bˆ in,c (t) and bˆin,i (t), respectively, where the PPT phonon spontaneous emission noise is
combined with the intrinsic thermal bath coupling of the mechanical mode in n¯ , as described in
section 3.1.
Using standard operational methods of quantum stochastic differential equations [49, 69],

Figure 11. The main plot shows the time variation of the fidelity F1 found
by numerically solving the quantum master equation for a version of the
quantum state-transfer protocol introduced by Cirac et al [67] for the state
transfer from the optical to the superconducting qubit. PPT parameters of
(γe , γi , κe , κi , ) = 2π × (10, 1, 2000, 200, 8000) MHz are used here for finding
the optical (F1B,A ; −·) and superconducting (F1A,B ; −·) state-transfer fidelity
curves for an initial state of |1 A |0 B . We see that a maximum fidelity F1A,B of
approximately 0.8 for the final state transfer is possible. The continuous lines
were found by quantum simulation of an ideal PPT, i.e. γi = κi = 0. In all of
max
the cases analyzed, the external system parameters were ( A , B , g max
A , gB ) =
2π × (50, 5.0, 5.0, 1.0)MHz. The inset shows the shape of the control pulse used
for the optical (– –) and superconducting (−·) qubits.

The final term in the master equation (84) is the cascading term [54, 69, 70], which gives rise to
the unidirectional coupling between the systems.
For the PPT, parameters typical of an OMC structure, such as the one with scattering
matrices plotted in figure 4, are used (γe , γi , κe , κi , ) = 2π × (10, 1, 2000, 200, 8000) MHz.
Equation (60) can be used to find the optimal matching optomechanical coupling rate, which
for the assumed PPT parameters is G o = 155.4 MHz. At this optomechanical coupling rate,
the resonant noise and scattering matrix parameters of the PPT are (s21 , s22 , n 21 , n 22 ) =
(0.917, 0.074, 0.290, 0.262), with a spontaneous emission noise equivalent occupation number
of n spon = 0.200. Assuming that the PPT is cooled to the same cryogenic temperature of the
superconducting qubit system (T < 100 mK), the thermal bath component of the effective
thermal occupancy of the PPT mechanical resonance can be neglected, and n¯ ≈ 0.251.
The exact functional form of the g j (t) is found through numerical optimization. This was
done by taking the pulse shape to be a step smoothed by a sinusoidal function with a rise (fall)
time of tr (tf ). Optimization on the state-transfer fidelity for an ideal PPT (s21 = 1) and for
circulators running in the direction shown in figure 10 (qubit transfer from the optical to the
superconducting system) leads to rise and fall times of t A = 23.5 µs and t B = 16 µs, which are
within the modeled PPTs (2γ )/2π = 22 MHz bandwidth.
Putting all of this together, in figure 11 we plot estimates of the fidelity of the quantum
state transfer between systems A and B via the connecting PPT. The definition of fidelity used
New Journal of Physics 13 (2011) 013017 (http://www.njp.org/)

27
to calculate the state-transfer efficiency is F jA,B = Tr A (| j B j B |ρ), where j = 0, 1, + represent,
respectively, the ground |0 , excited |1 and |+ = 2−1/2 (|0 + |1 ) states of the atomic and
superconducting two-level systems. Under these conditions and considering an ideal PPT
(s21 = 1), states are transfered with fidelities F1A,B = 0.9983, F+A,B = 0.9995 and F0A,B = 1.00.
Taking into account the actual scattering and noise matrix values given above for the PPT and
accounting for the spontaneous emission noise of the PPT, we find that the fidelities are reduced
to F1A,B = 0.803, F+A,B = 0.936 and F0A,B = 0.983. The inverse system, with circulators turning
the opposite direction to transfer qubits from the superconducting to optical system, was also
studied, for which the same input pulses only time reversed and yield fidelities F1B,A = 0.772,
F+B,A = 0.904 and F0B,A = 0.983.
6. Summary

We have introduced the concept and design of a traveling PPT. We have shown that with
a realistic set of parameters and the use of existing silicon OMC technology, efficient and
reversible conversion between phonons and photons should be possible. By characterizing the
noise processes experienced by such a device, both classically and quantum mechanically, we
have shown the utility of traveling phonon–photon translation to important problems in both
classical optical communication and quantum information processing.
