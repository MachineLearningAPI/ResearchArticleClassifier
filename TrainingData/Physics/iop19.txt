In a recent theoretical work by Narimanov and Kildishev (2009
Appl. Phys. Lett. 95 041106) an optical omnidirectional light absorber based
on metamaterials was proposed, in which theoretical analysis and numerical
simulations showed that all optical waves hitting the absorber are trapped
and absorbed. Here we report the first experimental demonstration of an
omnidirectional electromagnetic absorber in the microwave frequency. The
proposed device is composed of non-resonant and resonant metamaterial
structures, which can trap and absorb electromagnetic waves coming from all
directions spirally inwards without any reflections due to the local control of
electromagnetic fields. It is shown that the absorption rate can reach 99 per cent
in the microwave frequency. The all-directional full absorption property makes
the device behave like an ‘electromagnetic black body’, and the wave trapping
and absorbing properties simulate, to some extent, an ‘electromagnetic black
hole.’ We expect that such a device could be used as a thermal emitting source
and to harvest electromagnetic waves.

1. Introduction

In the past ten years research in metamaterials has attracted great interest in the scientific
community. The experimental and theoretical advances in artificial metamaterials have offered
scientists potent ways of tailoring the properties of electromagnetic waves in curvilinear space.
Metamaterials have manifested several exciting effects and devices, such as negative refraction,
electromagnetic invisibility cloaks, super-resolution imaging, electromagnetic concentrators
and light trapping [1]–[17], in which the required constitutive parameters could be fulfilled by
periodic/non-periodic arrays of electric or magnetic resonant/non-resonant particles. Current
technologies for designing and fabricating metamaterials have enabled realization of such
functional devices with unusual electromagnetic properties.
In this work, we realize an omnidirectional electromagnetic absorber in microwave
frequencies, based on the theoretical prediction using non-magnetic metamaterials [16], which
acts like an effective microwave ‘black body’ and absorbs incident waves from all directions
efficiently. We designed and fabricated the omnidirectional electromagnetic absorbing device
using non-resonant and resonant metamaterial structures, and measured internal electric fields
using a planar-waveguide near-field scanning apparatus. Experimental results agree well
with the full-wave numerical simulations, which show obvious phenomena of microwave
bending and trapping spirally into the device without coming back. The device can absorb
electromagnetic waves coming from all directions efficiently with an absorption rate of 99%
in the microwave frequency, which could find wide applications in thermal emitting and
microwave harvesting.
2. Analysis

In analytical mechanics, the motion of any particle can be described by Hamilton equations
∂H
d
∂H
d
p(t) = −
,
q(t) =
,
(1)
dt
∂q
dt
∂p
in which p is the generalized momentum, q is the generalized coordinate and H is the
Hamiltonian. The Hamiltonian represents the energy of the system, which is usually the
sum of kinetic and potential energy, denoted by T and V , respectively, as H = T + V, T =
p 2 /(2m), V = V (q), in which m is the mass of particle. All these could be deduced from the
Hamilton principle.
In geometrical optics, similar to the Hamilton principle, the Fermat principle governs the
propagation of light or electromagnetic waves. Considering that the eikonal function St (r, θ ) in

3
a two-dimensional (2D) cylindrical coordinate is expanded in series St (r, θ) = S(r, θ) − ωt as a
Hamilton–Jacobi equation, we could get the Hamiltonian in optics as [18]
ω2
p2
pr 2
+ 2θ ,
(2)
=
2µ0 2 (r ) 2r (r )
in which pr = ∂ S/∂r and pθ = ∂ S/∂θ are the radial and angular momenta in the cylindrical
coordinate, ω is the radian frequency, µ0 is the magnetic permeability in free space and (r ) is
the electric permittivity in the isotropic non-magnetic medium. Since the frequency is invariant
in a time-harmonic system, the above equation shows an energy conservation in mechanics.
From the Hamilton equation, the trajectory of geometrical optics looks like a unit particle in a
central potential that is given by [3]: Veff (r ) = ω2 c2 [ b − (r )]/2, in which b is the background
permittivity and c is the light speed. The inhomogeneous electric permittivity is chosen as

r > R,

 b
(r ) = s (r ) = b (R/r )2 , Rc r R,

r < Rc .

H=

The above permittivity distribution describes a layered dielectric cylinder, which includes a
lossy circular inner core and a lossless circular shell with radially varied permittivity, as shown
in figure 1(a). Here, Rc and R stand for the radii of the inner core and the outer shell of the
cylinder, while b and c represent the dielectric constants of the background medium and
the lossy material inside the√core. The radius of the core is closely related to the ratio of two
dielectric constants: Rc = R b / c . Under the ray approximation, it has been proved that the
light or electromagnetic waves hitting the cylinder will bend spirally in the shell region, and
be trapped and absorbed by the lossy core, as illustrated in figure 1(a). It is also shown that
the scattering cross-section per unit length of the cylinder is nearly zero, which is independent
of the polarization state of incident waves [16]. Hence the dielectric cylinder is a perfectly
omnidirectional absorber, behaving like an ‘electromagnetic black body’ or an ‘electromagnetic
black hole’ to some extent, which could absorb nearly all light or electromagnetic waves hitting
it from every direction.
3. Results and discussions

In this section, we validate the electromagnetic omnidirectional absorber through numerical
simulations and experiments in microwave frequency. From equation (3), the permittivity
distribution of the absorber’s outer shell (Rc < r < R) varies gradually from the inner core to
the background medium. Hence the outer shell can be realized by gradient refraction index
metamaterials, which have been used in the design of several new concept devices such as the
invisibility [5] and ground-plane cloaks [7, 8].
A number of non-resonant metallic structures can be utilized as the basic element of
gradient refraction index metamaterials, such as the circular ring, I-shaped structure, and
Jerusalem cross. The dimensions of unit geometries can be adjusted to meet the demand of
refraction indices at specific positions, to achieve the gradient distribution. In non-resonant
metamaterials, the resonant frequencies of unit geometries are much higher than the operating
frequency, and the dispersion curves for effective permittivity and permeability change slowly
in a broad band. Considering the anisotropy of most metamaterial units, the electromagnetic
constitutive parameters for the absorber are adjusted for the transverse-electric (TE) polarization

in the cylindrical coordinate as z = (r ), µφ = 1 and µr = 1. In our design, we choose the
non-resonant I-shaped structure [12] as the basic unit for the outer shell of the omnidirectional
absorbing device, and the electric-field-coupled (ELC) resonator [14] as the basic unit for the
inner core, which has large permittivity and large loss tangent simultaneously near the resonant
frequency.
The photograph of the fabricated omnidirectional absorbing device is shown in figure 1(b),
in which the I-shaped unit cell and ELC resonator are illustrated in figures 2(a) and (b),
respectively. The device is placed in the air; hence the permittivity of the background medium is
simply b = 1. In order to better demonstrate the absorption effect, a relatively high microwave
frequency ( f = 18 GHz) is selected in simulations and experiments. The sizes of both the
I-shaped unit cell and the ELC resonator are set as 1.8 mm, nearly 1/10 free-space wavelength.
The whole omnidirectional absorber is composed of 60 concentric layers, and each layer is
a thin printed circuit board (F4B, = 2.65 + i0.001) etched with a number of sub-wavelength

omnidirectional absorbing device. (a) The relation between the effective

unit structures. From equation (3), the permittivity changes radially in the shell of the absorber;
hence the unit cells are identical in each layer but have different sizes in adjacent layers. Since
the permittivity is a constant in the lossy core, the ELC resonators are identical in the whole
region.
Figure 2 demonstrates the effective medium parameters of the I-shaped and ELC units
for the designed device. The full-wave numerical tool (Microwave Studio, CST2006b) is used
to simulate the electromagnetic properties. Following the standard retrieval procedure [19],
the effective permittivity and permeability are obtained from the scattering parameters with
the change of geometry dimensions. To determine the relation between geometry and medium
parameters, an interpolation algorithm has been developed to generate the final layout according
to the permittivity distribution required by the omnidirectional absorber. From figure 2(a), by
changing the height of the I-shaped unit, the real part of permittivity Re( z ) ranges from 1.27

to 12.64 at 18 GHz, while the permeability components, Re(µr ) and Re(µφ ), are always close
to unity. The imaginary parts of permittivity and permeability for the I-shaped unit, not shown
here, are small enough to be neglected in the design. From figure 2(b), the operating frequency
is close to the resonant frequency of the ELC structure, which results in a very lossy permittivity
z = 9.20 + i2.65 and the permeability components µr = 0.68 − i0.01 and µφ = 0.84 − i0.14 at
18 GHz.
In our design, the space between adjacent layers is 1.8 mm; hence the radii of the absorber
and the lossy core are determined immediately as R = 108 mm and Rc = 36 mm. There are in
total 40 layers of I-shaped structures and 20 layers of ELC structures. In order to fix the 60 layers
with different radii together, a 0.8-mm-thick styrofoam board has been used with 60 concentric
circular slots carved by the LPKF milling machine (LKPF s100). Each layer has three unit
cells in the vertical direction, and hence the height of the absorber is 5.4 mm. To investigate the
interactions between the fabricated absorber and incident TE-polarized electromagnetic waves,
a parallel-plate waveguide near-field scanning system is used to map the field distributions near
the absorber at 18 GHz. A similar apparatus is discussed in [20]. The separation between two
plates is set as 6.5 mm, which is larger than the height of the device to avoid the unnecessary
dragging during measurements. The cutoff frequency of the waveguide system for the dominant
TEM mode is 23 GHz. The bottom plate is mounted on a step motor that can translate in two
dimensions. A monopole probe is fixed inside the waveguide as the feeding source, and a corner
reflector is placed on the back of source to produce the desired narrow beam. Four detection
probes are placed on the top plate to measure the field distributions on a plane above the absorber
under test, and each probe can scan a region of 200 mm × 200 mm independently. Hence the
total scanning region is 400 mm × 400 mm with a step resolution of 0.5 mm. All probes are
connected to a microwave switch that controls the measurement sequence after each movement
of the step motors below the bottom plate. The two ports of a vector network analyzer (Agilent
PNA-L N5230C) are connected to the feeding probe and the microwave switch, respectively,
via cables. Then the measurement data are sent to the controlling computer for post processing.
To demonstrate the performance of the omnidirectional absorbing device in the microwave
frequency, we first consider the case of Gaussian-beam incidence. Figures 3(a) and (b) illustrate
the distributions of simulated electric fields |E z | at 18 GHz when a Gaussian beam is incident
on the device on-center and off-center, respectively. We note that all on-center rays are directly
attracted by the device without reflections, and nearly all off-center rays bend in the shell region
spirally and are trapped by the core. To evaluate the absorption of the Gaussian beam by the
device, we define an absorbing rate from the Poynting theorem as
η = Pabsorb /Pin ,

Pabsorb = − 21 Re(

s

E × H ∗ · d S),

(4)

in which Pabsorb is the net power entering the device surface and Pin is the incident power. Under
the on-center and off-center incidences shown in figures 3(a) and (b), the absorbing rates are
calculated as 99.94 and 98.72%, respectively. Clearly, nearly all incident powers are absorbed,
and the device behaves like an ‘electromagnetic black body’.
In experiments at microwave frequencies, however, it is difficult to generate the
Gaussian beam. Hence we use a monopole probe with a corner reflector to produce the
narrow beam in our experiments, as demonstrated in figures 3(c)–(f). Compared to the Gaussian
beam, the produced beam is divergent while propagating. Similar to figures 3(a) and (b), we
measure two cases where the electromagnetic waves are incident vertically and obliquely to the
omnidirectional absorber. As a comparison, the full-wave numerical simulations are also given

to illustrate the absorption effect. Figures 3(c) and (e) illustrate the distributions of simulated
and measured electric fields |E z | at 18 GHz for the vertical-incidence case, which agree with one
other very well. It is clear that the incident beam becomes convergent inside the shell region and
then enters the lossy core of the device, instead of being divergent in the free-space radiation.
The absorbing rate corresponding to figure 3(c) is 99.55%; nearly full absorption. When the
beam is incident to the device at an oblique angle of 25◦ , the waves are bent toward the central
area and travel around the shell spirally with distinct absorption, as shown in figures 3(d) and
(f). Again, the simulation and experimental results agree well. From figure 3 we see that the
device is a good attractor and absorber of microwaves.
Hence we realize the electromagnetic omnidirectional absorber experimentally in the
microwave frequency, which could be used to collect microwaves and energies in free space.
When the incident waves are not narrow beams, they can also be absorbed efficiently by the
proposed device. Figures 4(a) and (b) demonstrate the field and power distributions inside and
outside the absorbing device under the incidence of plane waves. Obviously, nearly all incident

waves hitting the device are trapped at the center and do not emerge, with an absorption rate
of 99.12%. Being absorbed by the device, the incident waves hitting it cannot go through, and
the total fields are nearly zero in the front region, making a complete shadow. We also note
that the omnidirectional absorbing device almost does not disturb the electromagnetic waves in
other regions. When the incident waves are excited by a nearby monopole, the simulated and
measured field distributions are shown in figures 4(c) and (d), respectively. As with the case of
plane-wave incidence, nearly all incident waves hitting the absorber (see the black dashed lines)
are absorbed, producing a shadow region. The simulated and measured results agree well.
4. Summary

In summary, we have designed, fabricated and measured an electromagnetic omnidirectional
absorbing device at the microwave frequency using non-resonant I-shaped metamaterials and
resonant ELC metamaterials based on theoretical study [16]. We observed that nearly all
incident waves and energies hitting the designed device from every direction are attracted and
absorbed. Hence the device behaves like an ‘electromagnetic black body’ or ‘electromagnetic
black hole’ to some extent. The good agreement between theoretical and experimental results
has shown the excellent capability of metamaterials as a candidate for construction of artificial
omnidirectional absorbing devices. Since the lossy core can transfer electromagnetic energies
into heat energies, we expect that the proposed device could find important applications in
thermal emitting and electromagnetic-wave harvesting.
