Bayesian Compressive Sampling for Pattern Synthesis
With Maximally Sparse Non-Uniform Linear Arrays
Giacomo Oliveri, Member, IEEE, and Andrea Massa, Member, IEEE

Abstract—A numerically-efficient technique based on the
) for the design of maxiBayesian compressive sampling (
mally-sparse linear arrays is introduced. The method is based on
a probabilistic formulation of the array synthesis and it exploits a
fast relevance vector machine (
) for the problem solution.
The proposed approach allows the design of linear arrangements
fitting desired power patterns with a reduced number of non-uniformly spaced active elements. The numerical validation assesses
the effectiveness and computational efficiency of the proposed
approach as a suitable complement to existing state-of-the-art
techniques for the design of sparse arrays.

I. INTRODUCTION
YNTHESIZING antenna arrays with a minimum number
of elements is a problem of high importance in those
applications (e.g., satellite communications, radars, biomedical
imaging, acoustics, and remote sensing) where the weight, the
consumption, and the hardware/software complexity of the
radiating device have a strong impact on the whole cost of the
overall system [1], [2].
Non-uniform arrangements have potential advantages with
respect to uniform layouts [3] such as (a) significantly increased resolution (i.e., decreased mainlobe width) [4], (b)
sidelobe level control/reduction [5], and (c) enhanced efficiency in dealing with physically-constrained geometries (e.g.,
conformal architectures) [6]. However, sparsening array elements has the main drawback of reducing the control of the
beam shape [1]–[7] and several approaches for the design and
optimization of sparse arrangements have been proposed in the
last 50 years [1]–[31] to properly address such an issue.
Dealing with beam shape control, two different problems
are usually considered in the state-of-the-art literature [20]:
by

and sometimes the corresponding weights; (II) the synthesis

wide set of methods concerned with Problem I [2] has been
investigated including random approaches [11], [15], dynamic
-filter design [16], stochastic optiprogramming [12],
mization methods [17], [18], [20], [24], [27]–[29], analytical
techniques [22], [31], and hybrid algorithms [25], [30], as well.
On the contrary, Problem II has received less attention and few
methods have been developed [2], [3], [13], [14], [19]–[21],
[23], [26]. Because of the limitations of available computers,
first attempts relied on techniques requiring as few computational resources as possible such as the steepest descent method
[13] and the iterative least-square technique [14]. However,
those approaches have strong limitations as, for example, the
need to a-priori know the number of active elements of the
array and the aperture size [13], [14]. In order to overcome
these drawbacks, a technique exploiting the simplex search
was developed in [3] to find the sparsest array matching a
given reference pattern. Moreover, a mixed linear programming
approach was introduced in [19] with the same aim. Further
developments ranging from a recursive inversion algorithm
based on the Legendre transform [21], [26] up to the use of
a stochastic optimizer based on the simulated annealing technique [20] or a generalized Gaussian quadrature approach [23]
have been successively analyzed. More recently, Problem II
has been solved by means of an innovative technique based on
the matrix pencil method
[7]. Thanks to its efficiency,
generally outperforms other synthesis techniques

Despite its effectiveness, such an approach presents some

on the array performances cannot be a-priori estimated nor
neglected;
2) No requirements on the element positions [7] can be stated.
Thus, no geometrical regularity or user-desired geometric

The outline of the paper is as follows. Section II is aimed
at mathematically formulating the synthesis problem and describing an algorithm for minimizing a suitable cost function
that depends on the degree of sparseness of the array and the
mismatch between the desired power pattern and the actual one.
Section III provides a selected set of numerical results to validate the proposed approach as well as to compare its performances with state-of-the-art techniques. Finally, some conclusions are drawn (Section IV).

Assessment—Constrained Synthesis

This section is devoted to assess the reliability of the
approach in solving constrained synthesis problems
(i.e., matching a reference pattern under some explicit geometric and/or radiation constraints). Towards this aim, the
synthesis of a Dolph-Chebyshev pattern with
and
under different synthesis constraints
has been addressed. The first test case has been formulated
by enforcing the pattern matching constraints in the angular

It is also of interest to observe that the distribution of the array

• despite no specific constraints (e.g., on the maximum percentage of antenna elements that can be thinned) have been
enforced and unlike previous array thinning techniques, the
sparse arrays is very close to that of
directivity of
their fully-populated counterparts (Table I–IV);
•
usually outperforms
when dealing with
shaped beampatterns (Section III-C);
• application-specific constraints on either the radiation pattern or the geometrical characteristics of the array can be
easily and efficiently taken into account (Section III-D).
Subjects of future researches will be the analysis of the mutual coupling effects in the presence of realistic array elements
as well as an enhanced exploitation of directive elements.
Further extensions, out-of-the-scope of the present paper, will
concern with complex excitations and non-symmetric layouts.
Moreover, further works will be done on the sensitivity on
control parameters, performances and on the reduction of the
computational complexity of the method.

has been properly reformulated in a suitable Bayesian framework and successively solved with a fast solver. An extensive
numerical validation has been carried out dealing with different
reference patterns, array sizes, and constraints to assess the feasibility and reliability of the
approach as well as its efficiency, flexibility, and accuracy. Selected comparisons with
state-of-the-art techniques have highlighted the advantages and
(in some special cases) limitations of the
synthesis in
terms of sensitivity on control parameters, performances, and
computational complexity. The proposed technique has shown
the following main features:
• several tradeoffs solutions can be easily obtained by means
of simple modifications of the control parameters ( , ,
, and ) (Section III-A);
•
favorably compares with state-of-the-art techniques
such as the
[7] in terms of accuracy, array sparseness, and computational burden when matching reference
broadside patterns (Section III-B);
• on average the number of active elements in a
array
turns out to be smaller than the corresponding uniform arrangement
still providing
a high accuracy in matching the reference pattern (i.e.,
