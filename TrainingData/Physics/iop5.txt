We present the results of a global neutrino oscillation data analysis
within the three-flavour framework. We include the latest results from the
MINOS long-baseline experiment (including electron neutrino appearance and
anti-neutrino data), updating all relevant solar (Super-Kamiokande (SK) II + III),
atmospheric (SK I + II + III) and reactor (KamLAND) data. Furthermore, we
include a recent re-calculation of the anti-neutrino fluxes emitted from nuclear
reactors. These results have important consequences for the analysis of reactor
experiments and in particular for the status of the mixing angle θ13 . In our
recommended default analysis, we find from the global fit that the hint for
nonzero θ13 remains weak, at 1.8σ for both neutrino mass hierarchy schemes.
However, we discuss in detail the dependence of these results on assumptions
regarding the reactor neutrino analysis.

1. Introduction

The discovery of neutrino mixing and oscillations provides strong evidence for physics beyond
the Standard Model, opening a new era in particle physics. Here we update the three-neutrino
oscillation results of [1]3 with a special emphasis on the new reactor anti-neutrino flux results
of [5, 6], which have an important impact on the determination of the mixing angle θ13 . We
include new data from the MINOS Collaboration, both for νµ → νe transitions [7] and νµ
disappearance [8–10], the latest super-Kamiokande (SK) solar [11, 12] and atmospheric [13]
neutrino data, as well as recent KamLAND reactor data [14]. Our goal is to summarize the
results of the three-flavour neutrino oscillation analysis paying attention to sub-leading threeflavour effects where they are most relevant, as well as to the effects of the new anti-neutrino flux
emitted from nuclear reactors, which has been re-evaluated in [5]. The reported value of the ν¯ e
flux is about 3% higher than that from previous calculations. This has important consequences
for the interpretation of data from reactor experiments. We discuss the implications of the new
reactor neutrino flux for the determination of oscillation parameters, in particular its effect on
the mixing angle θ13 . We find that due to the new fluxes the results depend on the inclusion of
short-baseline (SBL) reactor data from distances 100 m.
In section 2, we present the updated analysis in the ‘atmospheric sector’, discussing the
SK I+II+III data [13] in section 2.1 and the MINOS disappearance results, taking into account
the solar squared-mass splitting and discussing the slight tension between neutrino and antineutrino data, in section 2.2. In section 2.3, we focus on the combined SK+MINOS analysis
and the determination of θ13 from these data. Section 3 contains a discussion on the reactor
neutrino data in light of the new predicted anti-neutrino fluxes; in section 4, we discuss solar
neutrino data, as well as KamLAND and the other reactor experiments. The results of the global
fit are summarized in section 5, which includes a detailed discussion on the status of θ13 . In
particular, we discuss the dependence of the θ13 determination on assumptions regarding the
reactor anti-neutrino data analysis. The conclusions are presented in section 6.

2. The atmospheric sector: Super-Kamiokande (SK) I+II+III and MINOS

2.1. SK I + I I + I I I data
We include in our analysis the full sample of atmospheric neutrino data from all three phases
of the SK experiment [13], using directly the χ 2 map provided by the SK collaboration. The
atmospheric neutrino oscillation analysis is performed within the one mass scale approximation,
neglecting the effect of the solar mass splitting, as in our previous papers [1, 2]4 .
In figure 1, we show the results of our previous atmospheric neutrino analysis in [1, 2]
including data from the first phase of the SK experiment, compared with the new analysis
included in this update, based on the SK data from all three phases of the experiment. The
differences between the two analyses are clearly seen, with an improved determination of
both the oscillation parameters. As we will see in the following, once data from neutrino
disappearance at the MINOS long-baseline experiments are included in the analysis, the
improvement in the determination of m 231 due to the recent atmospheric neutrino data is
‘hidden’ by the more constraining restrictions imposed by long-baseline data. Nevertheless,
this new atmospheric analysis will be important when constraining the mixing angle θ23 and
also θ13 .
2.2. MINOS disappearance data
At the Neutrino 2010 Conference, the MINOS Collaboration presented new data from their
searches for νµ disappearance, both from the neutrino (7.2 × 1020 protons-on-target (p.o.t.))
and the anti-neutrino (1.71 × 1020 p.o.t.) running mode. The neutrino analysis uses 27 energy
bins between 0 and 10 GeV, whereas in the case of anti-neutrinos the data sample is given as 13

Preliminary results towards a full three-flavour atmospheric neutrino analysis are presented in [15]; we look
forward to the corresponding information becoming publicly available.

1020 p.o.t., empty regions) versus current (7.2 × 1020 p.o.t., coloured/shaded
regions) νµ data. Right panel: the allowed regions from recent MINOS (7.2 ×
1020 p.o.t.) data, using neutrinos-only (red/solid empty lines), anti-neutrinos-only

energy bins in the range between 0 and 30 GeV. We perform a re-analysis of the data from [8–10]
within a full three-flavour framework using GLoBES software [16] to simulate the experiment.
In our analysis we include the backgrounds provided by the MINOS collaboration, assuming
a total systematic uncertainty of 5%. For neutrinos we assume an energy resolution of 15%,
√
whereas for anti-neutrinos we take the width of the energy resolution to be 0.1E ν + 0.15 E ν
for E ν in GeV. With this choice of energy resolutions, one can reproduce well the two-flavour
allowed regions obtained by MINOS. In addition to matter effects, we include also the effect
of m 221 as well as θ13 and the CP-phase δ in the analysis of the disappearance and appearance
channels. Since in our analysis MINOS data are the only ones sensitive to the phase δ we always
minimize the MINOS χ 2 with respect to δ.
In figure 2, the analysis of the new MINOS data is compared with the previous data release
(left panel). Apart from the smaller size of the allowed regions due to an increase in statistics, we
notice also a change in shape of the regions. This follows from the inclusion of the sub-leading
three-flavour effects in this new analysis.
In the right panel, we illustrate the impact of the (still small) anti-neutrino sample. From
this figure, it can be seen that there is a slight tension between the neutrino and the anti-neutrino
results: there is no overlap of the allowed regions at less than 90% CL. However, at 3σ the
results of both are fully consistent. We find the following χ 2 minima and goodness-of-fit (GOF)
values:

evaluated for two degrees of freedom, which implies that the neutrino and the anti-neutrino data
are consistent with a probability of 3.7%. This number indicates a slight tension between the
sets, at the level of about 2.1σ . In the following, we will use only neutrino data in the global
analysis. It is clear from figure 2 (right) that including also anti-neutrino data would have a
negligible impact on the global result.
2.3. The atmospheric sector: combined MINOS + atmospheric analysis and θ13
Combining the new atmospheric and MINOS disappearance data, we obtain new global
constraints on the atmospheric neutrino oscillation parameters. The results are shown in figure 3.
As before, m 231 is determined mainly by the MINOS data, whereas the atmospheric data are
more important in determining the mixing parameter sin2 θ23 . Note that the sub-leading effects
of m 221 lead to different best-fit points for | m 231 |, depending on whether the mass hierarchy
is normal (NH) or inverted (IH). We find the following best-fit values with errors at 1σ :

2.45 ± 0.09 ×10−3 eV2

(NH),
(IH).

(2)

The corresponding allowed regions are shown in figure 3 (right). The reason for this apparent
shift is just a result of our parameterization, using m 231 for both hierarchies, and changing only
its sign to cover the two cases. Hence, in NH the ‘largest’ frequency is given by | m 231 |, whereas
in IH it is | m 231 | + m 221 , which explains why | m 231 | is smaller for IH. Equation (2) shows that
these sub-leading effects must be included given the present accuracy, since they are at the level
of the 1σ error on m 231 .
Now we move on to the MINOS appearance data. Recently the MINOS Collaboration
has also reported new data from the search for νµ → νe transitions in the Fermilab NuMI
beam [7]. The new data are based on a total exposure of 7 × 1020 p.o.t, more than twice
the size of the previous data release [18]. The new MINOS far detector data consist of 54
electron neutrino events, whereas, according to the measurements in the MINOS near detector,

The black dot, blue star and white diamond correspond to the best-fit points of
SK, MINOS and SK+MINOS, respectively.

49.1 ± 7.0(stat) ± 2.7(syst) background events were expected. Hence, the observed number of
events is in agreement with background expectations within 0.7σ , and the hint for a nonzero
value of θ13 present in previous data [18] has largely disappeared. In fact, we see that once
we include the new MINOS data in our analysis, a smaller best-fit point of θ13 is obtained. As a
result, the hint for θ13 is less significant than before: for both hierarchies we find only a 0.8σ hint
when using the new MINOS data versus 1.3σ obtained with the previous MINOS appearance
data; for a discussion see, e.g., [19].
The atmospheric neutrino data from SK I + II + III described in the previous section imply
a best-fit point very close to θ13 = 0 [13], with χ 2 = 0.0(0.3) for θ13 = 0 for NH (IH).
However, in the combination of MINOS disappearance and appearance data, we even find a
slight preference for θ13 > 0, with χ 2 = 1.6(1.9) at θ13 = 0 for NH (IH). As shown in figure 4,
this happens due to a small mismatch of the best-fit values for | m 331 | at θ13 = 0, which can be
resolved by allowing nonzero values of θ13 [3]. This is similar to the hint for θ13 > 0 coming
from a slight tension between solar and KamLAND data; see [1, 2, 20, 21]. Therefore, the hint
for θ13 > 0 from the atmospheric+LBL data is now slightly stronger than the one obtained with
previous data.
3. New reactor fluxes and implications for oscillation parameters

Until very recently, the interpretation of neutrino oscillation searches at nuclear power plants
was based on calculations of the reactor ν¯ e flux given in [22, 23]. Indeed, the observed rates
at all reactor experiments performed so far at distances L 1 km are consistent with these
fluxes, therefore setting limits on ν¯ e disappearance. Recently, the flux of ν¯ e emitted from
nuclear power plants was re-evaluated [5], yielding roughly 3% higher neutrino fluxes than
assumed previously. As discussed in [6], this might indicate an anomaly in reactor experiments
at L 1 km, which according to the new fluxes observe a slight deficit. For the Chooz and Palo
Verde experiments at L 1 km, a nonzero θ13 could lead to ν¯ e disappearance accounting for

Figure 5. SBL reactor data. We show the observed rate relative to the predicted

rate based on old [22] (blue) and new [5, 6] (red) flux calculations. Small error
bars show statistical and uncorrelated systematic uncertainties; large error bars
include, in addition, correlated systematic Al uncertainties. The solid histograms
correspond to the fitted prediction shifted due to the uncertainty on the fluxes [6],

the reduction in the rate. However, m 213 and θ13 driven oscillations will have no effect on SBL
experiments with L 100 m.
Motivated by this situation, we include here the SBL reactor experiments Bugey4 [24],
ROVNO [25], Bugey3 [26], Krasnoyarsk [27], ILL [28] and Gösgen [29] via the rate
measurements summarized in table 2 of [6], in addition to the fit of the KamLAND, Chooz [30]
and Palo Verde [31] experiments. We use the neutrino fluxes from the isotopes 235 U, 239 Pu, 238 U
and 241 Pu given in [5]. For each reactor experiment we take into account the appropriate relative
contribution of the isotopes to the total flux and we include the uncertainty on the integrated
flux for each isotope given in table 1 of [6], correlated among all experiments. The total error
on fluxes from 235 U, 239 Pu and 241 Pu are at the level of 2%, where we assume that an error of
1.8% is fully correlated among the three isotopes, due to a common normalization uncertainty
of the corresponding beta-spectra measured in [22].
The SBL reactor data are summarized in figure 5. We show the observed rate relative
to the predicted rate based on old and new flux calculations. Due to the slightly higher fluxes
according to [5] all experiments observe a smaller ratio with the new fluxes. In figure 5, we show
also the result of a fit to the data with the predicted fluxes, allowing the four neutrino fluxes to
float in the fit subject to the uncertainties as described above. In the fit we assume that the
experimental systematic errors of the three data points from Bugey3, Gösgen and Krasnoyarsk,
as well as Bugey4 and ROVNO, are correlated, due to the same experimental technique. We
obtain χ 2 = 8.1 (13.0) for 12 degrees of freedom using old (new) fluxes. Clearly old fluxes
provide a better fit to the data, whereas the χ 2 for new fluxes is still acceptable (P-value of 37%).
Such a good fit can be obtained by a rescaling of the fluxes (subject to the quoted uncertainties)
as shown in the right panel.

For the blue curves (‘free norm’), a free overall normalization factor has been
introduced for the reactor fluxes. In this figure we fix m 231 = 2.45 × 10−3 eV2 .
Right: contours in the plane of sin2 θ13 and the flux normalization f . Coloured

Figure 6. Left:

The dashed lines in the figure correspond to a fit where we introduce an overall factor f
in front of the fluxes, which we let float freely in the fit. For the old fluxes, we find the
best fit value of f = 0.984 with f = 1 within the 1σ range. In contrast, for new fluxes we
obtain f = 0.942 ± 0.024, and f = 1 disfavoured with χ 2 = 6.2, which corresponds to about
2.5σ . This is the origin of the ‘reactor anti-neutrino anomaly’ discussed in [6]. A possible
explanation of this anomaly could be the presence of a sterile neutrino ‘visible’ in this oscillation
channel but not in the solar and/or atmospheric conversions, the so-called 3 + 1 scenario; see,
e.g., [32]. However, within the uncertainties on the neutrino flux prediction, the GOF of the
new fluxes to SBL reactor data is still rather good. Given this somewhat ambiguous situation,
in the following we will present the results for three-flavour oscillations adopting different
assumptions regarding reactor neutrino fluxes: (a) motivated by the excellent GOF of SBL
data to the new flux prediction, we take fluxes and the quoted uncertainties at face value,
and (b) we introduce the free flux normalization f in the fit. This second option takes into
account the possible presence of a sterile neutrino or some other correlated effect on all reactor
neutrino fluxes. In this scenario, the SBL reactor experiments effectively serve as near detectors
determining the flux, which is then used as input for the oscillation analysis at longer baselines.
We show the χ 2 from the Chooz and Palo Verde experiments as a function of sin2 θ13
in figure 6 (left) for various assumptions regarding the fluxes. If the new fluxes are taken at
face value and SBL reactor experiments are not included in the fit (solid green curve), we
obtain from Chooz and Palo Verde a hint for θ13 > 0 at about 90% CL, with a best-fit value
at sin2 θ13 = 0.021. In this case, ν¯ e disappearance due to θ13 accounts for the suppression of the
observed rate at L 1 km relative to the slightly increased prediction from the new fluxes.
However, as soon as SBL reactor experiments are included in the fit, the hint essentially

disappears and θ13 = 0 is consistent within 1σ . This can be understood from figure 5, which
shows that the SBL reactor experiments pull down the flux predictions, leaving less room for a
suppression at 1 km due to θ13 . The upper limit on sin2 θ13 is very similar to old and new fluxes
when SBL data are included, irrespective of whether the normalization is left free or not. These
results are in agreement with [6]. Figure 6 (right) shows the correlation between sin2 θ13 and the
flux normalization f with and without SBL experiments.
To summarize this section, we emphasize that owing to the tension between the new flux
predictions and the SBL oscillation data, depending on whether or not the SBL reactors are
included in the fit, different results on the extracted value of θ13 are obtained. This will indeed
be seen in our subsequent fit results; see, for example, section 5.
4. Solar + KamLAND analysis in the light of new reactor fluxes

The release of new solar data from the second and third phases of the SK [11, 12] experiment,
new data from the reactor experiment KamLAND [14] and the new predictions for the reactor
anti-neutrino fluxes make a revision of the solar + KamLAND neutrino data analysis necessary.
In figure 7, we show the 2σ allowed region from the solar + KamLAND neutrino data using
different assumptions in the reactor data analysis, such as including or not including the
SBL data or the use of a free normalization factor for the reactor anti-neutrino fluxes. In all
cases the shift of the allowed region is not very significant, and the best-fit point values vary
between 0.304 and 0.320 for sin2 θ12 , whereas the solar mass splitting m 221 goes from 7.59 to
7.64 × 10−5 eV2 . The variation in sin2 θ12 is slightly larger, because this parameter is correlated
with the shift of sin2 θ13 , as shown in figure 8.
In the left panel of figure 8 we show the 2σ allowed regions in the sin2 θ12 –sin2 θ13 plane
for different choices of the reactor data analysis. For comparison, we also show in grey the
2σ allowed region obtained from solar data alone. In the right panel of figure 8, we show the

with χ 2 (sin2 θ13 = 0) = 2.9, and therefore a 1.7σ hint for θ13 = 0 coming from the solar sector.
Compared with our previous analysis [1], the inclusion of new solar and KamLAND data and
the new reactor fluxes results in a similar best-fit value for the θ13 mixing angle (before, we
obtained sin2 θ13 = 0.022), but a slightly larger significance for nonzero θ13 (before: χ 2 = 2.2).
The origin of this is mainly the preference of KamLAND data for a nonzero θ13 , visible in the
left panel of figure 8. For KamLAND, θ13 acts mainly as an overall reduction of the spectrum,
and therefore, the increased event rate due to the new reactor fluxes can be compensated for by
a nonzero θ13 in KamLAND.
Let us note that Mention et al [6] have also investigated the implication for θ13 of reactor
neutrino data in the light of the new fluxes. Our results are in reasonable agreement with their
results, although minor quantitative differences exist, presumably due to the different data used
as well as the different analysis strategies.
5. Global three-neutrino analysis and status of θ13

Let us now present the results of the global analysis combining all data mentioned in the
previous sections5 . As default for the reactor analysis, we use the new anti-neutrino flux
predictions and include in the analysis the SBL reactor experiments as discussed in section 3.
Figure 9 shows the χ 2 profile as a function of sin2 θ13 for various data samples. In the upper
part of table 1, we display the corresponding best-fit values and the significance for θ13 > 0.
In our standard recommended analysis (new reactor fluxes, SBL reactors included), we find no
significant hint from Chooz and Palo Verde data, but the 1.7σ hint from solar + KamLAND (see
section 4) and the 1.3σ (1.4σ for IH) hint from atmospheric + MINOS data (see section 2.3)
combine to a global hint at 1.8σ for NH and IH, to be compared with the 1.5σ obtained in our
previous analysis. In the lower part of table 1, we discuss how this result depends on details
of the reactor neutrino analysis. If SBL data are not used in the fit the significance for θ13 > 0
is pushed close to 3σ because, as discussed in section 3, in this case Chooz and Palo Verde
prefer θ13 > 0 at about 90% CL. However, in the flux-free reactor analysis as well as with the
old reactor fluxes, the hint decreases to about 1.4σ and 1.8σ , respectively. The entry in the
table labelled ‘global without reactors’ comes from atmospheric and solar neutrinos plus data
from the MINOS long-baseline experiment. Therefore, these results are independent of any
ambiguity due to reactor fluxes, and we observe that a nontrivial limit on θ13 emerges even
in this case. Let us mention that here we always assume the AGSS09 solar model [33]. As
discussed previously [1, 3] there is a minor dependence of the hint for θ13 on this assumption.
Figure 10 illustrates the interplay of the various data sets in the plane of sin2 θ13 and m 231 .
In table 2, we summarize the determination of neutrino oscillation parameters for our reference
default reactor analysis. As discussed in section 4, the impact of this choice on the leading
oscillation parameters is small. We find that inverted hierarchy gives a slightly better fit, but
with only χ 2 = 0.54 with respect to the best fit in normal hierarchy.
6. Summary and conclusions

We have presented an updated global fit to the world’s neutrino oscillation data. A recent
re-evaluation of the anti-neutrino fluxes emitted in nuclear power plants [5] introduces some

ambiguity in the results obtained for the mixing angle θ13 . Since the new predictions are in slight
disagreement with data from SBL reactor experiments, with L 100 m, it becomes necessary
to include these data in the fit. A flux-free analysis of SBL data prefers an offset of the reactor
neutrino flux of about 6% from the predicted value with a significance of about 2.5σ . Taken
at face value this might indicate either some unaccounted for systematic effect (either in the
new calculations or in the reactor data) or even the presence of some kind of new physics
such as sterile neutrino oscillations with m 2 ∼ 1 eV 2 [6]. Here we stick to the three-flavour
framework; the sterile neutrino hypothesis will be discussed elsewhere [34].
Despite this hint for a deviation of the observed reactor anti-neutrino flux from its
prediction, the GOF of the SBL reactor neutrino data to the new fluxes is still very good
(χ 2 = 13 for 12 degrees of freedom). Motivated by this result, we adopt as our recommended
default analysis the new fluxes and include the SBL data in the fit. In this way we obtain a hint
for θ13 > 0 at 1.8σ , coming from a preference for a finite θ13 from KamLAND data combined
with a somewhat weaker hint from the joint analysis of atmospheric + MINOS data. Table 1

shows in detail how the global result depends on the assumptions regarding the reactor neutrino
analysis, yielding hints for θ13 > 0 ranging between 1.4σ and 2.8σ , with best-fit values between
sin2 θ13 = 0.007 and 0.027. This somewhat ambiguous situation regarding θ13 emerges from the
slight tension between the new reactor flux predictions and existing data. It will be interesting
to see how the upcoming results from new reactor and accelerator experiments searching for θ13
will contribute to resolving the issue; see [19] for an overview and references.
The main results of our recommended default analysis of three-neutrino oscillation
parameters are summarized in table 2 and in the right panels of figures 3 and 7 for the leading
‘atmospheric’ and ‘solar’ oscillation parameters, as well as in figure 10 for the mixing angle θ13 .
