Measurements √are presented from proton–proton collisions at
centre-of-mass energies of s = 0.9, 2.36 and 7 TeV recorded with the ATLAS
detector at the LHC. Events were collected using a single-arm minimumbias trigger. The charged-particle multiplicity, its dependence on transverse
momentum and pseudorapidity and the relationship between the mean transverse
momentum and charged-particle multiplicity are measured. Measurements in
different regions of phase space are shown, providing diffraction-reduced
measurements as well as more inclusive ones. The observed distributions
are corrected to well-defined phase-space regions, using model-independent
corrections. The results are compared to each other and to various Monte Carlo
(MC) models, including a new AMBT1 pythia6 tune. In all the kinematic
regions considered, the particle multiplicities are higher than predicted by the
MC models. The central charged-particle multiplicity per event and unit of
pseudorapidity, for tracks

1. Introduction

Inclusive charged-particle distributions have been previously measured in pp and pp¯ collisions
in a range of different centre-of-mass energies [1–17]. These measurements provide insight into
the strong interactions at low energy scales. Several quantum chromodynamics (QCD)-inspired
models have been developed to interpret them. These models are frequently cast into Monte
Carlo (MC) simulations with free parameters that can be constrained by measurements such
as minimum bias distributions. These measurements contribute to the understanding of soft
QCD; moreover, they are important in the determination of biases on high- pT phenomena due
to underlying events (UEs) and event pileup effects and are therefore of growing importance
for future Large Hadron Collider (LHC) physics. The measurements presented in this paper
implement a similar strategy to that in [1]. A single-arm trigger overlapping with the acceptance
of the tracking volume is used. The results are presented as inclusive-inelastic distributions,
with minimal model dependence; a minimum number of charged particles within well-defined
pT and η selection are required.
This paper reports on measurements of primary charged-particle multiplicity distributions

using the first
√ ∼190 µb of data recorded by the ATLAS experiment at 7 TeV and ∼7 µb at
0.9 TeV. At s = 0.9 TeV the sample is similar to
√that used for the first ATLAS minimum-bias
publication [1]. The results are also presented at s = 2.36 TeV where the track reconstruction
setup differs significantly from that at the other energies, due to the silicon tracker (SCT) not
being at nominal voltage. The integrated luminosity at this energy is estimated to be ∼0.1 µb−1 .

where pT is the charged-particle momentum component transverse to the beam direction1 , η is
the pseudorapidity of the particle, n ch is the number of charged particles in an event, Nev is the
number of events with a minimum number of charged particles within the selected kinematic
range, Nch is the total number of charged particles in the data sample and pT is the average
pT for a given number of charged particles2 . Primary charged particles are defined as charged
particles with a mean lifetime τ > 0.3 × 10−10 s either directly produced in pp interactions or
from subsequent decays of particles with a shorter lifetime.
The charged-particle multiplicity results are compared to particle-level MC predictions.
Three different phase-space regions are considered in this paper, with varying selection both
on the pT and the number of charged particles per event; all phase-space regions require
tracks within |η| < 2.5. Diffractive physics is expected to contribute mostly at low numbers
of charged particles and at low track momentum. Therefore, varying the selection on n ch and pT
in effect varies the relative contribution from diffractive events. Appendix B shows the results

The ATLAS reference system is a Cartesian right-handed co-ordinate system, with the nominal collision point
at the origin. The anti-clockwise beam direction defines the positive z-axis, while the positive x-axis is defined
as pointing from the collision point to the centre of the LHC ring and the positive y-axis points upwards. The
azimuthal angle φ is measured around the beam axis and the polar angle θ is measured with respect to the z-axis.
The pseudorapidity is defined as η = −ln tan(θ/2).

The factor 2π pT in the pT spectrum comes from the Lorentz invariant definition of the cross section in terms
of d 3 p. Our results could thus be interpreted as the massless approximation to d 3 p.

for two additional phase-space regions useful for MC tuning. This measurement, with refined
corrections and systematic uncertainty determination, supersedes the results presented in [1].
2. The ATLAS detector

The ATLAS detector [18] at the LHC [19] covers almost the whole solid angle around the
collision point with layers of tracking detectors, calorimeters and muon chambers. It has been
designed to study a wide range of physics topics at LHC energies. For the measurements
presented in this paper, the tracking devices and the trigger system are of particular importance.
The ATLAS Inner Detector (ID) has full coverage in φ and covers the pseudorapidity range
|η| < 2.5. It consists of a silicon pixel detector (Pixel), a silicon microstrip detector (SCT) and
a transition radiation tracker (TRT). These detectors cover a sensitive radial distance from the
interaction point of 50.5–150, 299–560 and 563–1066 mm, respectively, and are immersed in
a 2 T axial magnetic field. The ID barrel (end-cap) parts consist of three (2×3) Pixel layers,
four (2×9) double layers of single-sided silicon microstrips with a 40 mrad stereo angle and 73
(2×160) layers of TRT straws. Typical position resolutions are 10, 17 and 130 µm for the R–φ
co-ordinate and, in the case of the Pixel and SCT, 115 and 580 µm for the second measured
co-ordinate. A track from a charged particle traversing the barrel detector would typically have
11 silicon hits3 (three√
pixel clusters and eight strip clusters) and more than 30 straw hits.
For the runs at s = 2.36 TeV, stable beams were not declared by the LHC; the high
voltage on the SCT detector was thus not turned up to its nominal operating voltage but was left
in standby mode. The Pixel detector was in nominal conditions for these runs. The hit efficiency
in the SCT is thus significantly lower and special track reconstruction algorithms are needed; the
single hit efficiency at nominal voltage in the SCT barrel is above 99.7% [20], while in standby
it drops to ∼60% for tracks perpendicular to the silicon surface.
The ATLAS detector has a three-level trigger system: Level 1 (L1), Level 2 (L2) and Event
Filter (EF). For this measurement, the trigger relies on the L1 signals from the Beam Pickup
Timing Devices (BPTX) and the Minimum Bias Trigger Scintillators (MBTS). The BPTX
stations are composed of electrostatic button pick-up detectors attached to the beam pipe at
±175 m from the centre of the ATLAS detector. The coincidence of the BPTX signal between
the two sides of the detector is used to determine when bunches are colliding at the centre of
the ATLAS detector. The MBTS are mounted at each end of the detector in front of the liquidargon end-cap calorimeter cryostats at z = ±3.56 m. They are segmented into eight sectors in
azimuth and two rings in pseudorapidity (2.09 < |η| < 2.82 and 2.82 < |η| < 3.84). The data
were collected for this analysis using a trigger requiring a BPTX coincidence and MBTS trigger
signals. The MBTS trigger used for this paper is configured to require one hit above threshold
from either side of the detector, referred to as a single-arm trigger. The efficiency of this trigger
is studied with a separate prescaled L1 BPTX trigger, filtered to obtain inelastic interactions by
Inner Detector requirements at L2 and EF, the latter only for the 900 GeV data.
3. Monte Carlo (MC) simulation

Inclusive minimum bias data are modelled using three components in the pythia6 [21] MC
event generator: non-diffractive (ND), single- (SD) and double-diffractive (DD). ND processes

are modelled from two-to-two processes as described in this section. Diffractive process
modelling is described in section 3.1.
Low- pT scattering processes may be described by lowest-order perturbative QCD twoto-two parton scatters, where the divergence of the cross-section at pT = 0 is regulated by
phenomenological models. The pythia6 MC event generator implements several of these
models. The parameters of these models have been tuned to describe charged hadron production
and the UE in pp and pp¯ data at centre-of-mass energies between 200 GeV and 1.96 TeV.
Samples of MC events were produced for SD, DD and ND processes using the pythia6
generator4 . The ATLAS MC09 pythia tune [22] uses a specific set of optimized parameters;
it employs the MRST LO* parton density functions (PDFs) [23] and the pT -ordered parton
shower [24]. A tune is a particular configuration or set of values of the parameters of the
particular MC model. These parameters were derived by tuning to the UE and minimum-bias
data from the Tevatron at 630 GeV to 1.96 TeV. The MC samples generated with this tune are
used to determine detector acceptances and efficiencies and to correct the data. MC samples
were produced at all three centre-of-mass energies considered in this paper. The ND, SD and
DD contributions in the generated samples are mixed according to the generator cross-sections.
All the events are processed through the ATLAS detector simulation program [25], which
is based on geant4 [26]. They are then reconstructed and analysed by the same program chain
used for the data. Particular attention was devoted to the description in the simulation of the size
and position of the collision beam spot and of the detailed detector conditions during data taking.
The MC09 pythia6 samples are used to derive the detector corrections for these measurements.
The MC samples at 2.36 TeV were generated assuming nominal detector conditions.
For the purpose of comparing the present measurements to different phenomenological
models describing minimum-bias events, the following additional particle-level MC samples
were generated:
• the new ATLAS Minimum Bias Tune 1 (AMBT1) pythia6 tune described in section 3.2;
• the DW [27] pythia6 tune, which uses virtuality-ordered showers and was derived to
describe the CDF Run II UE and Drell–Yan data;
• the pythia8 generator5 [28], in which the diffraction model produces much harder pT and
n ch spectra for the SD and DD contributions than pythia6. The default parton shower
model is similar to the one used in pythia6 MC09;
• the phojet generator6 [29], which is used as an alternative model to pythia-based
generators. phojet relies on pythia67 for the fragmentation of partons.
3.1. Diffractive models
pythia6, pythia8 and phojet model the diffractive components very differently. Here we
mostly describe the model implemented in pythia6. The pythia6 diffraction is based on a
Regge-based pomeron model to generate the cross-section and generate the diffractive mass
and momentum transfer [30, 31]. To allow the Regge model to cover the full phase space,
empirical corrections are introduced [21]. These have the effect of enhancing the production of

small masses and suppressing production near the kinematic limit. Particle production from low
mass states (M X < 1 GeV) is treated as an isotropic two-body decay. Particle production from
high mass states is based on the string model. Two string configurations are possible depending
on whether the pomeron couples to a quark or gluon [21].
The pythia8 model uses the same model as pythia6 to generate the cross-section and
generate the diffractive mass and momentum transfer. The particle production for low mass
states uses the string model, but for higher masses (M X > 10 GeV) a perturbative element based
on pomeron–proton scattering is introduced. The non-perturbative string model introduces
a mass dependence on the relative probability of the pomeron scattering off a quark to
scattering off a gluon, which enhances the gluon probability at high masses. The perturbative
pomeron–proton scattering uses HERA diffractive PDFs [32] and the standard multiple
interactions framework is used to generate the parton–parton scattering. The introduction of
the perturbative pomeron–proton scattering results in a harder pT and multiplicity spectrum for
diffractive events generated with pythia8 compared with those generated with pythia6 [33].
However, it should be noted that relatively little tuning has been made of the diffractive
processes in pythia6 and pythia8.
phojet is based on the dual parton model. It generates a harder pT and multiplicity
spectrum in diffractive events than pythia6. The new diffraction model of pythia8 generates
distributions quite similar to those from phojet [33].
3.2. pythia6 ATLAS Minimum Bias Tune 1
Before the start of the LHC, an ATLAS tune to pythia6 with MRST LO* PDFs using Tevatron
UE and minimum bias data was produced, the so-called MC09 tune [22]. The first ATLAS
measurements √
of charged-particle production at the LHC [1] measured the charged-particle
production at s = 0.9 TeV in the central region to be 5–15% higher than the MC models
predict. In addition, neither the high n ch nor the high pT distributions were well described by
this tune and the pT was overestimated in events with n ch > 20. A new tune, AMBT1, was
developed
in order to √
adapt the free parameters of the ND models to the new experimental data
√
at s = 0.9 TeV and s = 7 TeV, using the same PDFs and pythia6 model choices as MC09.
tune is obtained by tuning to ATLAS minimum bias data at both
√ The AMBT1 √
s = 0.9 TeV and s = 7 TeV in a diffraction-reduced phase space that is presented in this
paper: n ch 6, pT > 500 MeV, |η| < 2.5. The tune was derived using preliminary versions of
these distributions [34]. The starting point for this tune is the ATLAS MC09c [22] pythia6 tune.
MC09c is an extension of the ATLAS MC09 tune where the strength of the colour reconnection
(CR) was tuned to describe the pT versus n ch distributions measured by CDF in p p¯ collisions
at the Tevatron [7].
Charged-particle distributions are sensitive to multi-parton interactions (MPI) and CR of
the hadronic final state [35]; the MPI are regulated by a low pT cut-off and the matter overlap
distribution of the two protons in which the additional partonic scattering takes place. These
are the main parameters varied for this new tune. Parameters related to final state radiation,
hadronization and fragmentation are not tuned, as these are constrained by many LEP results.
No changes to the diffraction model are made. The model parameters are adapted in order to
best describe these new distributions over the full range while maintaining consistency with the
Tevatron results. For the data MC comparisons the Rivet8 [36] package is used; the tuning is

tune; the meaning of the parameters is given below.
3.2.1. Multi-parton interactions (MPI) parameters. The size of the MPI component in the
pythia6 model is regulated by a simple cut-off parameter for the pˆ T of two-to-two scattering
processes. This cut-off parameter is fixed at a reference energy, which is generally taken as
1.8 TeV. The cut-off at this reference scale is called PARP(82). It is then rescaled for other
centre-of-mass energies using a parameter PARP(90). The rescaling is done according to the
following formula:
pTmin = PARP(82)

The amount of scattering is described by the matter overlap distribution between the
two protons, which regulates how many central, hard scatterings and how many less central,
softer scatterings occur. This distribution is modelled as a double Gaussian probability density
function. The parameter PARP(83) describes the fraction of matter in the narrower of the two
Gaussian functions. The size of this narrower Gaussian is given as a fraction PARP(84) of
the wider, main radius. The optimal value for this parameter was found in a first tuning run.
Further variations of the matter fraction in the narrower cone were found to not have a significant
influence on the main distributions used for tuning.
3.2.2. Colour reconnection (CR) parameters. The CR scenario of pythia used in MC09c
minimizes the total string length between partons. The probability that a given string piece does
not participate in the CR is given by (1 − PARP(78))nMI , where n MI is the number of MPI [21];
the larger the parameter, the smaller the probability of the string piece not participating. In
addition to this parameter, an additional parameter PARP(77) is present in pythia; it is used to

describe a suppression factor for the CR of fast moving string pieces. The suppression factor is
2
2
given by 1/(1 + PARP(77)2 · pavg
), where pavg
is a measure of the average squared momentum
that hadrons produced by the string piece would have.
3.2.3. Additional parameters investigated. In an initial study, the cut-off parameter for initial
state radiation (PARP(62)) and the cut-off for momentum smearing in primordial k⊥ (PARP(93))
were considered. The optimal values for these parameters were found in a first tuning run;
further variation of those parameters was not found to have a significant influence on the main
distributions used for tuning.
3.2.4. Distributions used. The tune described in this paper focuses on the ATLAS minimum
bias data. It primarily attempts to improve the description of the high pT and high n ch
distributions observed. For the pT spectrum, only particles above 5 GeV are considered. For
the n ch spectrum, only events with 20 or more tracks are used in the tune. For the pT versus
n ch distribution, only events with ten or more tracks are considered. The full η distribution is
used. For completeness, the preliminary UE results [39, 40] are included in the plateau region;
however, due to the limited statistics, these data have only a very small impact on the tune.
Tevatron data in the energy range of 630 GeV to 1.96 TeV are included in the tune, but
with a weight that is ten times lower than that of the ATLAS data. This weighting allows a
check of the consistency of the resulting tune with the Tevatron data while forcing the ATLAS
data to drive the tuning process. Similar datasets were used for the MC09c tune. The chargedparticle multiplicity shown in [41] was not included in the tune as no variation of the tuning
parameters considered was able to fit both the ATLAS and the CDF distributions simultaneously.
Appendix A shows a full list of the distributions and the ranges considered by the tune.

The final parameter values resulting from the tune are shown in table 1.

more than 97%

one or more counters above threshold on either side. The maximum instantaneous luminosity
is approximately 1.9 × 1027 cm−2 s−1 at 7 TeV. The probability of additional interactions in the
same bunch crossing is estimated to be of the order of 0.1%. In order to perform an inclusiveinelastic measurement, no further requirements beyond the MBTS trigger are applied.

4.1. Different phase-space regions considered
Three separate phase-space regions are considered in the main part of this paper with varying
contributions from diffractive events:
• at least one charged particle in the kinematic range |η| < 2.5 and pT > 500 MeV,
• at least two charged particles in the kinematic range |η| < 2.5 and pT > 100 MeV,
• at least six charged particles in the kinematic range |η| < 2.5 and pT > 500 MeV.
The first of these phase-space regions is studied at all three centre-of-mass energies. This is
the region that allows us to best investigate the evolution of charged-multiplicity distributions as
a function of centre-of-mass energy and thus constrain the MC parameters that dictate the energy
extrapolation of the models. The second measures the most inclusive charged-particle spectra
and is also used as the√basis for the model-dependent extrapolation to pT = 0; in this phasespace region results at s = 0.9 and 7 TeV are shown. The third phase-space region considered
is similar to the first but with a higher cut on the number of charged particles, thus reducing the
expected contribution from diffractive events in the sample. These distributions are measured for
both 0.9 and 7 TeV. This is the phase-space region that was used to produce the new AMBT1
tune. At 2.36 TeV only the first phase-space region is measured. Two additional phase-space
regions are presented in appendix B.
The relative contribution from diffractive events varies widely between MC models and
depends strongly on the phase-space region selection applied. The diffractive contribution is
constrained very little by previous data. Table 2 shows the predicted fractions of simulated
events originating from diffractive processes, as predicted by pythia6, pythia8 and phojet;
the values for the different tunes of pythia6 are found to be similar because the acceptances
of the different ND models do not change significantly and the diffractive models are identical.
The large difference in predictions between the models is one of the motivations for not making
any model-dependent corrections to the experimental data, as such corrections would vary
significantly depending on which MC model is used to derive them.
4.2. Event selection
To reduce the contribution from background events and non-primary tracks, as well as to
minimize the systematic uncertainties, the events are required to satisfy the following criteria:
New Journal of Physics 13 (2011) 053033 (http://www.njp.org/)

10
• to have triggered the single-arm, single-counter level 1 minimum bias trigger
scintillators;
• the presence of a primary vertex [42] reconstructed using the beam spot
information [43] and at least two tracks, each with
– pT > 100 MeV;
– a transverse distance of the closest approach with respect to the beam-spot position
|d0BS | < 4 mm;
• the rejection of events with a second vertex containing four or more tracks, to remove
events with more than one interaction per bunch crossing;
• a minimum number of tracks, depending on the particular phase-space region, as
described in section 4.3.
4.3. Track reconstruction algorithms
Tracks are reconstructed offline within the full acceptance range |η| < 2.5 of the ID [44, 45].
Track candidates are reconstructed by requiring a minimum number of silicon hits and
then extrapolated to include measurements in the TRT. Due to the SCT being in standby
mode at 2.36 TeV, different track reconstruction algorithms are needed; at 0.9 and 7 TeV,
the
√ reconstruction algorithms are collectively referred to as full tracks. The analysis at
s = 2.36 TeV has been performed using two complementary methods for reconstructing
tracks. The first reconstructs tracks using pixel detector information only, denoted by Pixel
tracks. The second uses tracks reconstructed from the full ID information, denoted by ID
tracks10 .
4.3.1. Algorithms for 0.9 and 7 TeV. For the measurements at 0.9 and 7 TeV, two different
track reconstruction algorithms are used. The algorithm used for the previous minimum-bias
publication [1] is used with a lower- pT threshold cut at 100 MeV. An additional algorithm
configuration is run using only the hits that have not been used by the first algorithm. This
additional algorithm uses wider initial roads and has a looser requirement on the number of
silicon hits. This second algorithm contributes around 60% of the tracks from 100 to 150 MeV,
mostly due to the tracks having too low a momentum to go far enough in the SCT detector
to satisfy the silicon hit requirement of the original algorithm; this fraction decreases rapidly,
reaching less than 2% at 200 MeV.
Tracks are required to pass the selection criteria shown in table 3; the column labelled Full
Tracks refers to the algorithms used at 0.9 and 7 TeV. The transverse, d0 , and longitudinal, z 0 ,
impact parameters are calculated with respect to the event primary vertex. The layer-0 selection
requires a hit in the innermost layer of the Pixel detector if a hit is expected11 . The track-fit
χ 2 probability12 cut is applied to remove tracks with mismeasured pT due to misalignment or
nuclear interactions.
10

In the context of the other analyses, ID tracks are referred to as track for brevity.
A hit is expected if the extrapolated track crosses an active region of a Pixel module that has not been disabled.
12
This probability function is computed as 1 − P(n dof /2, χ 2 /2), where P(n dof /2, χ 2 /2) is the incomplete gamma
function and n dof is the number of degrees of freedom of the fit. It represents the probability that an observed χ 2
exceeds the observed value for a correct model.

These tracks are used to produce the corrected distributions and will be referred to as
selected tracks. The multiplicity of selected tracks within an event is denoted by n sel . The tracks
used by the vertex reconstruction algorithm are very similar to those used for the analysis; the
pT threshold is also 100 MeV. Due to the requirement that the vertex be made from a minimum
of two such tracks and the fact that we do not wish to correct our measurement outside of
the observed phase-space region, the minimum number of particles per event for the phasespace region with pT > 100 MeV also needs to be set at two. Table 4 shows the total number of
selected events and tracks for all phase-space regions considered.

4.3.2. Track reconstruction algorithms at 2.36 TeV. Operation of the SCT at standby voltage
during 2.36 TeV data taking led to reduced SCT hit efficiency. Consequently, ID tracks are
reconstructed at this centre-of-mass energy using looser requirements on the numbers of hits

12
and holes13 [44, 45]. There are no simulation samples that fully describe the SCT operating
at reduced voltage. A technique to emulate the impact of operating the SCT in standby was
developed in simulation; this corrects the MC without re-simulation by modifying the silicon
clusterization √
algorithm used to study the tracking performance. However, the final ID track
efficiency at s = 2.36 TeV was
√ determined using a correction to the track reconstruction
efficiency derived from data at s = 0.9 TeV.
Pixel tracks were reconstructed using the standard track reconstruction algorithms limited
to Pixel hits and with different track requirements. There is little redundant information,
because at least three measurement points are needed to obtain a momentum measurement and
the average number of Pixel hits per track is three in the barrel. Therefore, the Pixel track
reconstruction efficiency is very sensitive to the location of inactive Pixel modules. The total
distance between the first and the last measurement point in the pixel detector, as well as the
limited number of measurement points per track, limit the momentum resolution of the tracks;
therefore the Pixel tracks were refitted using the reconstructed primary vertex as an additional
measurement point. The refitting improves the momentum resolution by almost a factor of
two. However, the Pixel track momentum resolution remains a factor of three worse than the
resolution of ID tracks.
The selection criteria used to define good Pixel and ID tracks are shown in table 3. The
total numbers of accepted events and tracks at this energy are shown in table 4. These two
track reconstruction methods have different limitations; the method with the best possible
measurement for a given variable is chosen when producing the final plots. The Pixel track
method is used for the n ch and η distributions, while the ID track method is used for the pT
spectrum measurement; the pT distribution is not produced for this energy as neither method
is able to describe both the number of particles and their pT accurately.
5. Background contribution

5.1. Event backgrounds
There are three possible sources of background events that can contaminate the selected sample:
cosmic rays, beam-induced background and the presence of another collision inside the same
bunch crossing. The fraction of cosmic ray background events was estimated in [1], where it was
found to be smaller than 10−6 . Beam-induced backgrounds are estimated from non-colliding
empty bunches using the same method as described in [1]; after final event selection, fewer than
0.1% of events are predicted to originate from beam-induced backgrounds. The reconstructed
primary vertex requirement is particularly
useful in suppressing the beam-induced background.
√
The instantaneous luminosity at s = 7 TeV is high enough that the effect of multiple collisions
inside the same bunch crossing cannot be ignored. Events are rejected if they have a second
vertex with four or more tracks14 . After this cut, the fraction of events with more than one
interaction in the same bunch crossing is measured to be about 0.1%; the residual effect is thus
neglected. At the lower centre-of-mass energies, the rate of multiple interactions is lower and
thus also neglected.
13

A hole is defined as an absence of a hit when it is expected given the track trajectory.
Events with two vertices with fewer than four tracks are dominated by events where a secondary interaction is
reconstructed as another primary vertex and are thus not removed from our data samples.

electrons (pink long-dashed) and non-electrons (green dot-dashed). The full red
curve shows the ND MC prediction for the sum over the three components, which
agrees well with the data (black points).
5.2. Backgrounds to primary tracks
Primary charged-particle multiplicities are measured from selected-track distributions after
correcting for the fraction of non-primary particles in the sample. Non-primary tracks are
mostly due to hadronic interactions, photon conversions and decays of long-lived particles, as
well as a small fraction of fake tracks. Their contribution is estimated using MC predictions
for the shape of the d0 distribution for primaries, non-primaries from electrons and other nonprimaries. The separation between non-primaries from electrons and non-electrons is needed as
the electrons are mostly from conversions in the detector material and would thus be sensitive
to a mismodelling of the detector material, whereas the non-electron non-primary tracks are
mostly from long-lived particles and this fraction is thus also sensitive to the underlying
physics. The Gaussian peak of the d0 distribution, shown in figure 1 for 100 < pT < 150 GeV, is
dominated by the primary tracks and their resolution. The non-primary tracks populate the tails.
The dominant contribution to non-primary tracks inside the acceptance cut on |d0 | comes from
non-electrons.
The primary, electron non-primary and non-electron non-primary d0 distributions are
obtained from MC and used as templates to extract the relative fractions in data. A fit is
performed in the side-bands of the distribution, i.e. outside the range in d0 used for selecting
tracks. The fractions of primary, electron non-primary and non-electron non-primary tracks
are all allowed to float with the total number of events constrained to that of the data. The
contribution of non-primaries from electrons within the analysis acceptance of 1.5 mm is small,
while it dominates at high values of |d0 |. The requirement on having a hit on layer-0 suppresses
this contribution enough to allow the fit to be performed down to the lowest pT region. The fit
is performed in bins of 50 MeV in pT from 100 to 500 MeV. A single fit is used for all tracks
New Journal of Physics 13 (2011) 053033 (http://www.njp.org/)

14
with pT > 500 MeV; in this bin the distinction is not made between the two sources of nonprimary tracks. The fraction√of non-primary tracks varies from 3.4% for 100 < pT < 150 MeV
to 1.6% above 500 MeV at s = 7 TeV. Figure 1 shows the observed d0 distribution for the bin
100 < pT < 150 MeV compared to the MC predictions after the fit.
5.2.1. Systematic uncertainties. The full difference between the non-primary fraction in MC
and that in data obtained using the fit is taken as a systematic uncertainty. The largest difference
is found to be an increase of non-primaries in data by 25% relative to the MC for pT > 500 MeV.
This conservative estimate is taken to be constant as a function of pT and results in only a small
effect, up to 0.9%, on the final corrected distributions. In order to estimate the effect of the
choice of the variable used to obtain the fit, the fraction of primary and non-primary track
contributions are obtained by fitting the z 0 distributions. The difference is measured to be 12%
in the first bin, 8% in the last bin and less than 4% in all other bins; this difference is taken as a
source of systematic uncertainty. The estimated number of non-primary tracks in |d0 | < 1.5 mm
is found to be stable with respect to a change in the fit range of 1 mm in all pT bins except the
first one (100 < pT < 150 MeV), where a 10% difference is observed; this difference is taken as
a systematic uncertainty. The fraction of non-primary tracks is found to be independent of n sel ,
but shows a small dependence on η, taken as a small systematic uncertainty of 0.1%.
The total uncertainty on the fraction of non-primary tracks is taken as the sum in
quadrature
of all these
√
√ effects. The total relative uncertainty on the measured distributions at
s√
= 0.9 TeV and s = 7 TeV is 1.0% for the first pT bin, decreasing to 0.5% above 500 MeV.
At s = 2.36 TeV this uncertainty for the Pixel track method is 0.6%.
6. Selection efficiency

The data are corrected to obtain inclusive spectra for charged primary particles satisfying
the different phase-space region requirements. These corrections include inefficiencies due
to trigger selection, vertex and track reconstruction. They also account for effects due to the
momentum scale and resolution and for the residual background from non-primary tracks.
In the following sections the methods used to obtain these efficiencies, as well as the
systematic uncertainties associated with them, are√described. Plots are shown for the phasespace region n ch 2, pT > 100 MeV, |η| < 2.5 at s = 7 TeV, but similar conclusions can be
drawn at the other energies and phase-space regions.
6.1. Trigger efficiency
The trigger efficiency, εtrig , is measured from a data sample selected using a control trigger. The
control trigger used for this
√ analysis selects events from random filled bunch crossings, which
are then filtered at L2. At s = 0.9 TeV the L2 filter requires a minimum of seven pixel
√ clusters
and seven SCT hits and the EF requires at least one track with pT > 200 MeV. At s = 7 TeV
the L2 requirement is loosened to four pixel clusters and four SCT hits. No EF requirements
are made at this energy. The vertex requirement for selected tracks is removed for these trigger
studies, to account for correlations between the trigger and vertex reconstruction efficiencies.
The trigger efficiency is determined by taking the ratio of events from the control trigger in
which the L1√MBTS also accepted the event, over the total number of events in the control
sample. √
For s = 2.36 TeV there is not sufficient data to measure the trigger efficiency and
thus the s = 0.9 TeV parameterization is used to correct the 2.36 TeV data.

Systematic uncertainties. Since there is no vertex requirement in the data sample used to
measure the trigger efficiency, it is not possible to make the same impact-parameter selection

trigger efficiency is measured after applying the impact-parameter constraints with respect to
the primary vertex if available or with respect to the beam spot if not. The difference in the
efficiency obtained this way and in the nominal way is considered as a systematic uncertainty.
This variation provides a conservative estimate of the effect of beam-induced background and
non-primary tracks on the trigger efficiency at low values of n BS
sel . The systematic uncertainty
arising from possible correlation of the MBTS trigger with the control trigger is studied using
simulation, and the effect of correlations on the trigger efficiency is found to be less than 0.1%.
The total systematic uncertainty on the trigger efficiency determination, which also includes the
statistical uncertainty on the control sample, is of the order of 1% in the first n BS
sel bin, decreasing
rapidly as n BS
increases.

6.2. Vertex reconstruction efficiency
The vertex reconstruction efficiency, εvtx , is determined from data by taking the ratio of triggered
events with a reconstructed vertex to the total number of triggered events, after removing the
expected contribution from beam background events. The efficiency is measured to be 90–92%
in the first n BS

at higher track multiplicities. The vertex reconstruction efficiency at s = 7 TeV for n BS
2,
sel
BS
pT > 100 MeV is shown in figure 2(b) as a function of n sel .
The dependence of the vertex reconstruction efficiency on the η and pT of the selected
tracks is studied as well as the dependence on the projection along the beam-axis of the
separation between the perigees15 of the tracks ( z), for events with more than one track. For
all phase-space regions, only the dominant effect is corrected for as the other effect is always
found to be significantly smaller and would thus not affect the final result.
For the lower pT threshold selection, a strong dependence is observed as a function of
z for events with two tracks; this bias is corrected for in the analysis using two different
parameterizations depending on the pT of the lowest pT track: one for tracks below 200 MeV
and one for those above that threshold. The dependence on the vertex reconstruction efficiency
due to the η of the tracks is found to be smaller than the z correction and is neglected for
this phase-space region. For the 500 MeV pT threshold selection, the η dependence is corrected
for events with n BS
z dependence is found to be
sel = 1. For events with higher multiplicities the
very small and is neglected.
Systematic uncertainties. The difference between the vertex reconstruction efficiency measured
with beam background removal and the vertex reconstruction efficiency measured without beam
background removal is assigned as the systematic uncertainty on the vertex reconstruction
efficiency. For the determination of this difference, the contribution of beam-related
backgrounds is estimated using non-colliding bunches, as in [1]. The highest rate of beamrelated background is found in the phase-space region with pT > 100 MeV at 900 GeV, where it
is 0.8% without vertex selection and 0.2% with vertex selection, although it is found to decrease
rapidly at higher multiplicities. (This beam-related background contribution is larger than that
given in section 5 where a reconstructed primary vertex was required.) The total uncertainty due
to the vertex reconstruction efficiency is significantly below 1% for all phase-space regions at
all energies. Figure 2(b) shows the total error for the phase-space region with pT > 100 MeV at

s = 7 TeV.

6.3. Track-reconstruction efficiency for the 0.9 and 7 TeV data samples
The track reconstruction efficiency, εtrk , determined from MC, is parameterized in bins of pT
and η. The excellent agreement between data and MC of basic track quantities for tracks
above 500 MeV demonstrated previously [1]. Figure 3 highlights the agreement for tracks in

matched
where pT and η are generated particle properties, Nrec
( pT , η) is the number of reconstructed
tracks matched to a generated charged particle and Ngen ( pT , η) is the number of generated
charged particles in that bin. The matching between a generated particle and a reconstructed
track uses a cone-matching algorithm in the η–φ plane, associating the particle with the track
with the smallest R = ( φ)2 + ( η)2 within a cone of radius 0.15. In addition, the particle
trajectory must be compatible with the position of one of the pixel hits of the track. A larger
cone size than in [1] is needed to account for the degraded resolution at lower track pT .
The resulting
√ reconstruction efficiency as a function of η integrated over pT is shown in
figure 2(c) at s = 7 TeV for the phase-space region with the lowest pT threshold. The track
reconstruction efficiency is lower in the region |η| > 1 due to particles passing through more
material in that region. Figure 2(d) shows the efficiency as a function of pT integrated over η.
The initial rise with pT is due to the requirement on the minimum number of silicon hits required
in the analysis, which indirectly constrains the tracks to pass through a minimum number of
detector layers and thus have a minimum pT .

Systematic uncertainties. As the track reconstruction efficiency is determined from MC, the
main systematic uncertainties result from the level of agreement between data and MC. The
overwhelming majority of particles in the selected events are hadrons. These are known to
suffer from hadronic interactions with the material in the detector. Thus a good description
of the material in the detector is needed to get a good description of the track reconstruction
efficiency. To quantify the influence of an imperfect description of the detector description,
in particular the material in the simulation, two different data-driven methods are used. The
first reconstructs the invariant mass of K s0 mesons decaying to two charged pions; the second
compares the track lengths in data and simulation. The K s0 mass method studies the mass as
a function of the decay radius of the meson; it has greatest sensitivity to small radii, while
the track length study probes the material description in the simulation in terms of nuclear
interaction length (λ) in the SCT detector. The combination of both methods provides good
sensitivity throughout the silicon detectors. They allow us to constrain the material to better
than 10% in the central barrel region and better than 30% at the highest |η| measured. The
material uncertainty is the largest uncertainty in almost all regions of all distributions plotted
in this paper. In the barrel region, the total uncertainty due to the material is 8% at low pT ,
going down to 2% above 500 MeV. The uncertainty increases with increasing |η|; the largest
uncertainties are in the region 2.3 < |η| < 2.5: 15% in the first pT bin decreasing to 7% above
500 MeV.
The track-fit χ 2 probability cut has been found to offer powerful discrimination against
tracks with mismeasured momenta. These are mostly very low momentum particles that are
reconstructed with much higher momentum due to misalignment or nuclear interactions16 .
Mismeasured tracks are seen predominantly at the edges of the η acceptance where the distance
between consecutive measurement points of the outer layer of the Pixel and the first layer of the
SCT can reach up to ∼1 m. The fraction of mismeasured tracks is observed to be significantly
more in data than in MC even after this cut is applied. Two different methods are used to
estimate the fraction of mismeasured tracks in data. The first compares the momentum obtained
from the tracks reconstructed using only the SCT hit information to that obtained for fully
reconstructed tracks. After normalizing the number of well-measured tracks in MC to data, the
scaling of the MC high- pT tails needed to model the data is obtained. The second method uses

the difference between data and MC seen in the tails of the d0 distributions at high pT because
mismeasured tracks tend to have poorly reconstructed d0 . Again a scaling factor is obtained to
scale the MC tails in order to describe the data. These two methods give very similar results.
Both methods are used to obtain the systematic uncertainty for all but the outermost regions
in η where the effect is the most significant. In this region an additional method is used that
compares the η distributions, normalized in the central region, in bins of pT . The variation
with pT of the η distribution due to physics is small compared to the differences observed due
to mismeasured tracks. The additional tracks at high |η|, high pT are considered to be due
to mismeasured tracks and the fraction of mismeasured tracks in data is obtained. This third
method gives the systematic uncertainty for the outermost η bins. Averaged over the whole η
region, the fraction of mismeasured tracks in data is found to be negligible for pT < 10 GeV, 3%
for 10 < pT < 15 GeV and increases to 30% for 30 < pT < 50 GeV. An additional systematic
on the track reconstruction efficiency of 10% is taken for all tracks with pT > 10 GeV due to
different efficiencies of the χ 2 probability cut in data and MC. All systematic uncertainties on
the mismeasured high- pT tracks are taken as single-sided errors.
Studies using Z → µµ events show that the resolution in data is about 10% worse than
the nominal MC resolution above 10 GeV. The impact of a 10% Gaussian smearing of the
reconstructed track pT in MC is performed and found to have a 7% effect for the binning
used in this paper. This effect is taken as a systematic uncertainty on tracks above 10 GeV.
This systematic uncertainty is single-sided and added linearly with the systematic uncertainty
due to the mismeasured high- pT tracks. The effect on tracks below 10 GeV is found to be
negligible.
The pT cut applied at various stages of the pattern recognition inside the track
reconstruction algorithm introduces an inefficiency due to the momentum resolution. A different
momentum resolution or a bias in the momentum estimation in data compared to MC can result
in a change in the migration out of the first bin in pT (100 < pT < 150 MeV) and thus a gain
or loss of observed tracks. The default migration correction is derived using the resolution in
MC. The track pT resolution at the seed finding stage in MC is increased by a very conservative
10 MeV, making the pT resolution effectively 15 MeV instead of 10 MeV. The effect of this shift
on the track reconstruction efficiency in the first pT bin is found to be about 5%; this difference
is assigned as a systematic uncertainty.
A detailed comparison of track properties in data and simulation is performed by varying
the track selection criteria. The largest deviations between data and MC are observed at high η
and are found to be ∼1%. For simplicity, a constant 1% uncertainty is assigned over the whole
range.
A summary of the track reconstruction systematic uncertainties is shown in table 5.
The total uncertainty due to the track reconstruction efficiency determination is obtained by
adding all effects in quadrature except for tracks above 10 GeV where the resolution and
mismeasured track effects are added linearly; asymmetric errors are considered for these
effects.

statistical limitations of√the reference dataset
√ is 2%. An additional 3% uncertainty accounts for
the extrapolation from s = 0.9 TeV to s = 2.36√TeV, which was estimated
by comparing the

distributions of the number of ID tracks between s = 0.9 TeV and s = 2.36 TeV. The total
uncertainty on the efficiency correction factor adds those two effects in quadrature to obtain a
total uncertainty of 4%.
The material uncertainty is estimated using a similar method as for the other energies;
the absolute uncertainty is found to be 2% (3%) for the Pixel (ID) track reconstruction
efficiency. The uncertainty is larger for ID tracks, because such tracks are sensitive to
the material throughout the whole silicon detector. The uncertainty due to the momentum
resolution is negligible because the phase-space cuts are sufficiently far from the track algorithm
cuts.
There is an additional 1% uncertainty on the Pixel track method due to the matching
procedure. The relative Pixel track reconstruction efficiency differs from the primary efficiency
due to material effects and contributions from non-primary tracks. There is an additional
discrepancy of 4% for 2.4 < |η| < 2.5 that is assigned as a systematic uncertainty for those bins.

7. Correction procedure

The effect of events lost due to the trigger and vertex requirements is corrected using an eventby-event weight:
1
1
wev (n BS
·
,
sel ) =
BS
εtrig (n sel ) εvtx (n BS
sel , x)
where x is either the z between tracks or the η of the tracks, as described in section 6.2.
The pT and η distributions of selected tracks are corrected for using a track-by-track
weight:
1
wtrk ( pT , η) =
· (1 − f nonp ( pT )) · (1 − f okr ( pT , η)),
εtrk ( pT , η)
where f nonp is the fraction of non-primary tracks determined as described in section 5.
The fraction of selected tracks passing the kinematic selection for which the corresponding
primary particle is outside the kinematic range, f okr ( pT , η), originates from resolution effects
and has been estimated from MC. The uncertainty on f okr is mostly due to the resolution
difference
between data and MC. This uncertainty is negligible for all cases except at
√
s = 2.36 TeV for the Pixel track method where the uncertainty is estimated to be 1%, due
to the poor momentum resolution of the Pixel tracks. No additional corrections are needed for
the η distribution; the additional corrections needed for the other distributions are described in
the following sections.
For all distributions in all phase-space regions considered, closure tests are carried out.
These are tests carried out on MC where the reconstructed samples are corrected according
to the same procedure as used on the data; the resulting difference between the corrected
distribution and the known particle-level distribution is defined as the amount of non-closure;
if the correction procedure were perfect, the non-closure would be zero. For this analysis,
closure tests are carried out on all distributions in all phases-space regions and unless explicitly
mentioned in the text the level of non-closure is less than 1%.
7.1. Correction to

dNev
dn ch

First, the observed n sel distribution is corrected for the trigger and vertex reconstruction
efficiencies. Then, an event-level correction is applied using Bayesian unfolding [46] to correct
the observed track multiplicity to the distribution of the number of primary charged particles,
as follows. An unfolding matrix, Mch,sel , is defined that expresses the probability that a given
selected track multiplicity, after all other event-level corrections are applied, n sel , is due to n ch
primary particles. This matrix is normalized such that the number of events does not change
except for the rare cases where n sel > n ch and n ch is below our acceptance selection. This matrix
is populated from MC09 MC and applied to data in order to obtain the observed n ch distribution.
The resulting distribution is then used to re-populate the matrix and the correction is re-applied.
This procedure is repeated without a regularization term and converges after four iterations in
data; convergence is defined as the first iteration in which the χ 2 difference between the result
of the unfolding and the input distribution for that iteration is less than the number of bins used
in the unfolding.
After the n sel distribution has been unfolded, the resulting charged-particle multiplicity
distribution is corrected for events migrating out of the selected kinematic range (n ch X ),
New Journal of Physics 13 (2011) 053033 (http://www.njp.org/)

23
which the matrix does not account for. This is achieved by adding an additional term to the
correction. The correction terms for the phase-space regions with n ch 2 are
1/(1 − (1 − εtrk )nch − n ch · εtrk · (1 − εtrk )(n ch −1) ),

(5)

where εtrk is the mean effective track reconstruction efficiency for a given n ch bin. Corresponding
terms are used for the other phase-space regions. This track reconstruction efficiency can, in
principle, be different for each n ch bin, but the difference is found to be small and thus the mean
effective track reconstruction efficiency for the lowest n ch bin is used.
Systematic uncertainties. The systematic uncertainties on the unfolding procedure are obtained
by modifying the input distributions as described below, applying the unfolding procedure
and comparing the output to that obtained when using the nominal input; the matrix and the
correction factors are not modified.
There are two sources of systematic uncertainties considered. One of them is due to the
track reconstruction efficiency uncertainties, while the second one accounts for the different pT
spectra reconstructed in data and MC. The first source of uncertainty is estimated by starting
from the observed n sel spectrum in data; tracks are randomly removed from the distribution
according to the mean pT and η of the tracks for each value of n sel and the uncertainty on the
track reconstruction efficiency for those pT and η values. A new input distribution is obtained
and put through the unfolding procedure and the difference with respect to the nominal n ch
distribution is taken as a systematic uncertainty. The uncertainty is then symmetrized. The
uncertainty on n√
ch due to the uncertainty on the track reconstruction efficiency is found to be ∼
3% to ∼25% at s = 7 TeV in the most inclusive phase-space region, n ch 2, pT > 100 MeV,
|η| < 2.5.
The other source of uncertainty originates from the unfolding method that is carried out in a
single dimension at a time, in this case n ch . There is some dependence on the pT spectrum of the
MC sample used to populate the matrix, due to the strong dependence of the track reconstruction
efficiency on pT . To investigate this effect, the average track reconstruction efficiency derived
using the pT spectrum in data and that obtained from MC are compared. The difference of these
two mean efficiencies is then treated in the same way as the uncertainty on track reconstruction
efficiency, described in the previous paragraph. This uncertainty is taken to be asymmetric; only
the contribution from a shift of the spectrum in the direction of the data is taken. The mean value
is kept as that given by the √
nominal pT spectrum in MC. The uncertainty varies with increasing
n ch from −2% to +40% at s = 7 TeV in the most inclusive phase-space region.
The only additional systematic uncertainty due to the tuning of the track reconstruction
efficiency is due to the difference between the biases introduced by the vertex correction in MC
and data. The estimation of this error is done by comparing the z 0 distribution in n BS
sel = 2
between data and MC. The z 0 distribution is a very good probe of the correlation between
n sel /n ch and n BS
z 0 values, while events with
sel as events with high n sel tend to have small
n sel < 2 tend to have large z 0 . Very good agreement is found between the data and MC.
Re-weighting the z 0 distribution in MC to match the data or applying the vertex correction
extracted from the data to the MC closure test leads to a systematic uncertainty of the order
of 0.1% for n ch = 2 where this effect is most pronounced. As this error is much smaller
than other systematic uncertainties considered, it is neglected. The systematic uncertainty
due to track–track correlation in a single event is small and is neglected everywhere in this
analysis.

24
7.2. Corrections to Nev
The total number of events, Nev , used to normalize the final distributions, is defined as the
integral of the n ch distributions, after all corrections are applied.
Systematic uncertainties. The systematic uncertainties on Nev are obtained in the same way as
for the n ch distributions. Only those systematics affecting the events entering
√ or leaving the
phase-space region have an impact on Nev . The total uncertainty on Nev at s = 7 TeV for the
most
√ inclusive phase-space region is 0.3%, due mostly to the track reconstruction efficiency. At
s = 2.36 TeV the total uncertainty on Nev is 1.4% for the Pixel track and 2.6% for the ID track
methods.
7.3. Corrections to

1
pT

ch
· dN
d pT

The tracks are first corrected for the event level inefficiencies of the trigger and the vertex
reconstruction. Then the tracks are corrected for the track reconstruction inefficiencies, nonprimary track contamination and out of kinematic range factors. Finally, a similar unfolding
method to that used on the n ch distribution is used to correct the measured track pT to the
primary particle momentum. More bins are used for the unfolding than are shown in the final
distributions; this is necessary in order to avoid amplification of small data MC differences with
successive iterations, causing large fluctuations. For this distribution four iterations are required
before convergence is reached; convergence is defined as for the n ch distribution.
Systematic uncertainties. To estimate the effect on the final pT distributions of the uncertainties
affecting the correction steps prior to the unfolding, the unfolding procedure is re-run on the
corrected pT distribution shifting the distribution used as input to the unfolding procedure by
the systematic uncertainties. This new pT distribution is put through the unfolding procedure
and the difference with respect to the nominal corrected pT spectrum is taken as a systematic
uncertainty.
The high- pT systematic uncertainties are obtained using the MC samples. The systematic
uncertainty associated with the mismeasured high- pT tracks is obtained by scaling the number
of mismeasured tracks in MC to match those found in data. This new input distribution is put
through the unfolding procedure and the final difference with respect to the nominal MC is
taken as a systematic uncertainty. The systematic uncertainty associated with the resolution is
obtained by smearing the well-measured tracks, in MC, by the resolution uncertainty obtained
in section 6.3. The effect on the final unfolded distribution is taken as a systematic uncertainty.
Those two high- pT systematics are added linearly. Both cause only single-sided variations. This
combined uncertainty is measured
√ to be from −10% for pT = 10 GeV to −30% for the last
pT bin (30 < pT < 50 GeV) at s = 7 TeV for the n ch 2, pT > 100 MeV phase-space
region.
√
The variations for other phase-space regions at this energy are similar. At s = 0.9 TeV this
uncertainty is found to be –20% for all three bins above pT of 10 GeV.
To assess the stability of the results under varying starting hypotheses for the MC spectrum
used to fill the matrix, a flat initial prior is used as an input. While convergence is only typically
reached after seven iterations, instead of three for the nominal prior, the final difference in the
unfolded spectra is small. The difference between the resulting distribution obtained with a flat
prior
√ and that obtained with the MC pT spectrum as a prior is taken as a systematic uncertainty.
At s = 7 TeV this uncertainty is less than 2% for nearly all pT bins, with
√ the exception of a
couple of bins around changes in bin width, where the effect is 3–5%. At s = 0.9 TeV, due to
more limited statistics in the MC, the largest change seen is 7% with a few others around 3–4%.

25
7.4. Mean pT versus n ch
The correction procedure for the pT versus n ch distribution is designed to correct separately
two components: i pT (i) versus n ch and i 1 versus n ch and take the ratio only after all
corrections are applied. The sum is over all tracks and all events; the first sum is the total
pT of all tracks in that bin in n ch ; the second sum represents the total number of tracks in that
bin. The sums will be referred to as the numerator and denominator, respectively. Each of these
distributions, i pT (i) and i 1, is corrected in two steps.
Firstly, the two distributions as a function of n sel are corrected on a track-by-track basis
by applying the appropriate track weights; this track-by-track correction is applied to the data
distribution and thus no longer relies on the pT spectrum of the MC. Secondly, the matrix
obtained after the final iteration of the n ch unfolding described in section 7.1 is applied to each
of the distributions to unfold n sel to n ch . Finally, the ratio of the two distributions is taken to
obtain√the corrected pT versus n ch distribution. For this distribution

removes

s = 7 TeV.
This unfolding procedure assumes that the tracking efficiency depends only on pT and
η and is independent of the track particle multiplicity and that the pT spectrum of the tracks
in events that migrate back from a given n sel bin to a given n ch bin is the same as the pT
spectrum of tracks in events in the corresponding n sel bin. The fact that these assumptions are not
completely valid is taken as a systematic uncertainty. This uncertainty is obtained by looking at
the non-closure of the corrected distribution in the MC. This residual non-closure is, we believe,
a consequence of the two main assumptions. A full parameterization of the track reconstruction
efficiency in terms of pT , η and n ch would remove the need for the first assumption, while a full
two-dimensional unfolding as a single step where the two dimensions were pT and n ch would
remove the need for the second. Both of these are beyond the scope of the current paper. In
order to understand if the amount of non-closure is a realistic estimate of the uncertainty on the
method when applied to data, in particular to investigate its dependence on the pT spectrum,
the whole unfolding procedure is carried out using pythia6 DW tune samples and the pythia8
samples; we varied both the input distribution and the matrix used to do the unfolding. The
level of non-closure is found to be similar to that obtained with the MC09 pythia6 samples. We
thus conclude that the level of non-closure is not strongly dependent on the pT spectrum. This
allows us to use the residual non-closure as a systematic uncertainty on the unfolding method
as described in the next section.
Systematic and statistical uncertainties. For the calculation of the statistical uncertainty, the
full correlation between the tracks inside the same event was not computed. The statistical
uncertainty in the numerator and denominator are computed separately and then added in
quadrature after taking the ratio. This is found to be a conservative estimate of the uncertainty.
Systematic uncertainties considered for the pT versus n ch distribution are either due to
assumptions made during the correction procedure or to uncertainties on quantities taken from
the MC and used during the correction procedure.
The first category refers to the assumptions on the method, the effects of which are visible
in the closure test. To account for these imperfections, we apply a systematic uncertainty of 2%,
which covers the non-closure in MC, except for the highest n ch bin and the first few n ch bins
in some of the phase-space regions. For these cases a larger systematic uncertainty is applied
to cover the non-closure. For the analyses with pT > 500 MeV, where the size of a non-closure
New Journal of Physics 13 (2011) 053033 (http://www.njp.org/)

26
is larger, a 3% systematic error is applied in the n ch = 1 bin. This systematic uncertainty also
covers the difference in non-closure between samples created using MC09 (default) and those
with DW tune of pythia6 and pythia8. In the correction procedure we use the approximation
that n sel = n BS
sel . The effect of such an approximation is studied on simulation and found to be
negligible with respect to the other sources of uncertainty.
The second category comprises uncertainties on the track correction weights wev (n BS
sel )
and wtrk ( pT , η) and on the migration probabilities obtained from the unfolding matrix. The
dominant systematic uncertainties that affect both the track correction weights and the migration
probabilities are the same as those affecting the n ch distribution unfolding: the uncertainty on
the track reconstruction efficiency and the effect of the difference in pT spectra between the data
and MC. These uncertainties are propagated by varying the input distribution for both i pT (i)
versus n sel and i 1 versus n sel .
Smaller effects are also studied, for example the uncertainty on the rate of non-primary
tracks and the effect of the systematic uncertainties affecting the high- pT tracks mentioned in
section 6.3. Excluding the systematic uncertainties due to the assumptions made during the
correction procedure, the systematic uncertainties are between 0.5% and 2% for all bins in n ch ,
all energies and all phase-space regions.
7.5. Correction for different minimum n ch requirements
The only difference in the correction procedure from track to the particle level for n ch 6 with
respect to n ch 1 is the need for an additional correction that takes into account the effect on
the tracks due to the tighter cut on both the number of tracks and the number of particles.
The n ch distribution and the number of events Nev are obtained by correcting and unfolding
the multiplicity distribution of the whole spectrum and then applying the higher n ch cut on the
final distribution. For the pT and η track distributions an extra correction is needed. For events
with n sel 6, the tracks are added to the distribution as for all other phase-space regions; a
weight corresponding to the product of the track (wtrk ) and event (wev ) weights is applied. For
events with n sel < 6 the tracks are added to the distribution with an additional weighting factor,
namely wn ch <6 that represents the probability that a track from an event with n sel tracks is from
an event with n ch 6. This additional weight is taken from the final n ch unfolding matrix, after
the final iteration; each column in the matrix represents the probability that an event with n sel
tracks has n ch particles. The total probability ( p(n ch 6|n sel )) for a given n sel < 6 is therefore
the sum over the matrix elements for n ch 6
wn ch <6 = p(n ch

6|n sel ) =

Mnch ,nsel ,
n ch 6

where Mnch ,nsel is the entry in the unfolding matrix for n ch and n sel . This weight is about 65% for
n sel = 5 and rapidly drops to 1% for n sel = 2.
Systematic uncertainties. All uncertainties related to the distributions with the lower n ch cut are
taken into account. In addition, an extra systematic uncertainty due to the uncertainty on the
track reconstruction efficiency is needed for the correction to higher n ch selection. By varying
the track reconstruction efficiency down by its uncertainty, different wn ch <6 weights are obtained.
The shift in the resulting n ch distribution is symmetrized and taken as an additional systematic
uncertainty.

7.6. Extrapolation to pT = 0
Comparing the results in our well-defined phase-space regions to other inclusive measurements
from other experiments requires additional model-dependent corrections. One such correction is
described here, but applied only for comparative purposes. This particular correction is derived
to extrapolate the average multiplicity in the phase-space region with the lowest measured pT
to the multiplicity for all pT > 0. No attempt is made to correct for the n ch 2 requirement.
The results are quoted for the average multiplicity in the rapidity interval |η| < 2.5 and are
not considered to be the main results of this paper. This correction is obtained using three
independent methods: fitting the pT spectrum to a given functional form, assuming a flat
ch
distribution at low pT in the observed fully corrected p1T · dN
distribution and obtaining the
d pT
correction factor from the AMBT1 pythia6 MC.
In the first method, the corrected pT spectrum is fitted with a two-component Tsallis
distribution

where m T ( pT ) is the transverse mass m T = pT 2 + m 20 and m 0 is the particle rest mass m 0 =
{m π , m p } and dNch /dy| y=0,i , Ti and n i are the six parameters of the fit. η represents the
pseudorapidity at the edge of our acceptance, η = 2.5. dNch /dy| y=0 represents the integrated
yield of the particle production at mid-rapidity, but is left here as a free parameter of the fit.
Mesons (pions and kaons) are merged into a single Tsallis function since there is insufficient
information in the measured distribution to fit three independent shapes. The tanh−1 factor
accounts for the variation in E/ p of each track over the entire measured pseudorapidity range.
It is derived by integrating dy
dη over |η| < 2.5.
dη
From this functional form and using the parameters obtained from the fit, the fraction
of particles with pT < 100 MeV is extracted. This procedure gives the correction factor to be
applied to the mean charged-particle multiplicity per unit η, averaged over |η| < 2.5, in order
to get the inclusive multiplicity.
The correction √
factor from pT > 100 MeV to pT > 0 MeV is
√
found to be 1.065 at s = 0.9 TeV and 1.063 at s = 7 TeV.
ch
The second method assumes that the p1T · dN
distribution is flat at low pT . One can thus use
d pT
the value of this distribution in the lowest pT bin (100 < pT < 150 MeV) to extract the value for
tracks below 100 MeV. From this assumption, the fraction of particles below 100 MeV and the
scale factor √
used to correct our observed√distributions are derived. The scale factors are found to
be 1.068 at s = 0.9 TeV and 1.065 at s = 7 TeV. The third and final method simply obtains
the correction factor using one of√the MC models. AMBT1 pythia6
is chosen; the correction
√
factors are found to be 1.055 at s = 0.9 TeV and 1.051 at s = 7 TeV. We chose to use the
scale factor obtained from the functional form fit as the central value and consider the difference
between this and the other two methods as a systematic uncertainty.
Systematic uncertainties. Several sources of systematic uncertainty on the calculated scale
factor are considered. The dominant uncertainty comes from the difference in the scale factors

obtained from the three different extrapolation methods. The largest difference between the
value obtained from the fit and the values from the MC and from the flat extrapolation is
considered as the uncertainty
√
√ and then symmetrized. This uncertainty is found to be 0.007 at
s = 0.9 TeV and 0.012 at s = 7 TeV.
The other sources of uncertainty are related to the fitting procedure such as the variation
within the uncertainty on the fit parameters and the variation due to a change of the fit range.
All sources of uncertainty are assumed to be uncorrelated and thus added
√ in quadrature.

8. Total systematic uncertainties

The individual sources of systematic uncertainties have already been discussed in previous
sections. The effect on the final distribution from each source is treated independently and
propagated to the final distributions; the total error is the sum in quadrature from the different
sources, unless explicitly mentioned in the text. In most bins of all distributions
√ the largest
uncertainty comes from the track reconstruction efficiency. The uncertainties at s = 2.36 TeV
are larger than at the other two energies due to the uncertainties related to the operation of the
SCT at reduced bias voltage during 2.36 TeV data taking. The total uncertainties are shown as
shaded bands in the final distributions presented in the next section.
9. Results and discussion

The corrected distributions for primary charged particles for events in three separate phase-space
regions are shown in figures 5–13. The results are compared with predictions of models tuned to
a wide range of measurements. The measured distributions are presented as inclusive-inelastic
distributions within a given phase-space region with minimal model-dependent corrections to
facilitate the comparison with models.
9.1. Charged-particle multiplicities as a function of the pseudorapidity
Figures 5 and 6 show the charged-particle multiplicity as a function of pseudorapidity. Figure 5
shows the distribution at all three centre-of-mass energies in the phase-space region, n ch 1,
pT > 500 MeV, |η| < 2.5. The mean particle density is roughly constant for |η| < 1.0 and
decreases at higher values of |η|. There is little shape variation between the models except
for the DW pythia6
√ tune, which has a flatter spectrum and a more pronounced dip at central η,
especially at low s. At all three energies the AMBT1 pythia6 tune gives the best shape and
normalization description of the data, although it was tuned for n ch 6.
Figures 6(a) and (b) show the η distributions for the most inclusive phase-space region,
n ch 2, pT > 100 MeV, |η| < 2.5. There is less η variation than in the previous figure. At
900 GeV there is very little difference between the models both in shape and normalization
with the exception of phojet, which shows excellent agreement with the data; the other models
show on average too few particles. The shape of the distribution is reasonably well described
by all models. At 7 TeV again all the shapes seem to model the observed spectrum reasonably
well, but at this energy the difference in normalization among the models varies more widely
and no model reproduces the data.

Figures 6(c) and (d) show the η distributions for the phase-space region with the least
amount of diffraction, n ch 6, pT > 500 MeV, |η| < 2.5. The distributions in√this phase-space
region have the largest drop at high |η|. All but pythia6 DW and phojet at s = 7 TeV show
reasonable agreement in both shape and normalization at both energies.
9.2. Charged-particle multiplicities as a function of the transverse momentum
Figures 7 and 8 show the charged-particle multiplicities as a function of the transverse
momentum. The first of these figures shows all three centre-of-mass energies considered in
the phase-space region n ch 1, pT > 500 MeV and |η| < 2.5. The observed pT spectrum is not
described by any of the models over the whole range. The region that the models have the most
difficulty describing is the region above 1 GeV.
Figures 8(a) and (b) show the charged-particle multiplicities in the most inclusive phasespace region. At 900 GeV phojet describes the data best over the whole range even though
the agreement is still not excellent. The other models tend to underpredict the number of
low- pT particles, while at higher pT the models vary widely. At 7 TeV the effect at low pT
is more pronounced, whereas at high pT the agreement of pythia8 and phojet with the
data is quite good. The AMBT1 and MC09 tunes of pythia6 predict too many particles at
higher pT .
Figures 8(c) and (d) show the charged-particle multiplicities with the smallest contribution
from diffractive events. This distribution carried the most weight in the AMBT1 tune.
Considerable improvement in the agreement with data is seen between the older MC09 and
the newly tuned AMBT1 but the parameters varied in this tune were not sufficient to describe
the full spectrum.
9.3. Charged-particle multiplicity distribution
Figure 9 shows the charged-particle multiplicity distributions for n ch 1, pT > 500 MeV and
|η| < 2.5 at all three centre-of-mass energies. At low number of charged particles, all models
predict more events than observed in data, which is compensated for by an underprediction in
the tails of the distributions. It should be noted that due to the normalization, 1/Nev , a deviation
observed in one region needs to be compensated for by one in the other direction somewhere
else. Although the predictions of phojet at 0.9 TeV model the data reasonably well, at 2.36
and 7 TeV they do not model the observed spectrum. The new AMBT1 pythia6 tune seems to
provide the best agreement with data.
Figures 10(a) and (b) show the distribution for the most inclusive phase-space region. Here
the variations between models at both low and high values of n ch are increased and no model
predicts the observed spectra.
Figures 10(c) and (d) show the distribution for the diffraction-reduced phase-space region.
The distributions are very similar to those in figure 9 with a cut at n ch 6; only the normalization
is different between the plots. The errors are also recomputed as there is a larger cancellation
between the numerator and the denominator for this phase-space region.
9.4. Average transverse momentum as a function of the number of charged particles
The final set of distributions discussed in the main part of this paper is the average transverse
momentum as a function of particle multiplicity. The measurement of pT as a function of

charged multiplicity at s = 2.36 TeV is not shown because different track reconstruction
methods are used for determining the pT and multiplicity distributions, as discussed in
section 4.3.2. Figure 11 shows the results for events with n ch 1, pT > 500 MeV and |η| < 2.5.
At 900 GeV the slope versus n ch for high values of n ch seems to be well described by most
models but the absolute value is best modelled by pythia6 DW. At the highest centre-of-mass
energy above 20 particles the models vary widely both in slope and in absolute value; at low
values of n ch none of the models describe the data very well. In the more√inclusive phase-space
region, figures 12(a) and (b), the models vary widely, especially at high s.

the Pixel track method. The phase-space region with the largest minimum pT and the highest
minimum multiplicity ( pT > 500 MeV; n ch 6), which is the region with the least amount of
diffraction, is the one where the models vary the least and the energy extrapolations of most
models agree best with the data. However, in this region the energy extrapolations of pythia6

agree with the data and the spread at 7 TeV in the expected values is almost one third of the

section 7.6, the averaged inclusive charged-particle multiplicity

multiplicity for events with two or more particles within |η| < 2.5. Figure 14 compares these
results to recently published ALICE results [5, 6] for inclusive inelastic as well as inelastic with
more than one particle. The ALICE results are quoted as averages over |η| < 1.0 and |η| < 0.5,
respectively.

Figure 14. The average charged-particle multiplicity per unit of rapidity as a

function of the centre-of-mass energy. The ATLAS results are for n ch 2 in
the region |η| < 2.5. For comparison, ALICE results for n ch 1 in the region
|η| < 1.0 and n ch 0 in the region |η| < 0.5 are shown. It should be noted that
the ALICE points have been slightly shifted horizontally for clarity. The data
points are compared to pythia6 AMBT1 predictions for the same phase-space
regions.

at 7 TeV, the properties of events in three well-defined phase-space regions were studied. The
data were corrected with minimal model dependence to obtain inclusive distributions. The
selected kinematic range and the precision of this analysis highlight clear differences between
MC models and the measured distributions. In all the kinematic regions considered, the particle
multiplicities are higher than predicted by the MC models.
The three different phase-space regions studied, from the most inclusive to the one
with the smallest diffractive contribution, highlight various aspects of the charged-particle
spectra. In general, the agreement between the models and the data is better in the phasespace regions with higher minimum pT cut-off, where diffractive contributions are less
significant. √
For the s = 0.9 TeV measurements with the pT threshold of 500 MeV, these results
supersede the results presented in [1].

Appendix A. Distributions used in AMBT1 tuning

Tables A.1 and A.2 show the list of all distributions from ATLAS and the Tevatron, respectively,
used in the ATLAS Minimum Bias Tune 1 (AMBT1). The ‘Analysis’ column refers to the event
selection used in the particular analysis. The ‘Tuning range’ column refers to the portion of the
phase-space region that is considered for the tune.
Appendix B. Additional phase-space regions

Two additional phase-space regions are considered in this appendix:
• at least 20 charged particles in the kinematic range |η| < 2.5 and pT > 100 MeV,
• at least one charged particle in the kinematic range |η| < 2.5 and pT > 2.5 GeV.
The correction procedures as well as methods used to extract the systematic uncertainties are
identical to the three phase-space regions presented in the main part of the paper. The first
phase-space region is chosen to be compared to the other diffraction-reduced phase-space
region with six particles above 500 MeV and allows the study of the interplay between the
number of particles and the pT , in particular for the study of diffraction models. The second
additional phase-space region is chosen so as to be less influenced by non-perturbative parts of
the ND modelling and to be useful in predicting high- pT particle rates, for example for trigger
studies.
