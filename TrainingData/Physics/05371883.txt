Printed Single-Strip Monopole Using a Chip Inductor for
Penta-Band WWAN Operation in the Mobile Phone
Kin-Lu Wong and Shu-Chuan Chen

Abstract—A single-strip monopole capable of generating two wide operating bands at about 900 and 1900 MHz covering GSM850/900/1800/1900/
UMTS penta-band WWAN operation in the mobile phone is presented. The
monopole has a simple structure of an inverted-L shape to be printed on the
no-ground region of the system circuit board of the mobile phone. By simply
embedding a chip inductor at the proper position in the strip monopole,
the first two resonant modes of the monopole can have a frequency ratio
of about 1 to 2 (instead of 1 to 3 for the traditional monopole) to respectively cover the desired wide 900 and 1900 MHz bands. In addition, the total
strip length can be less than the required 0.25 wavelength (about 0.17 wavelength in this design) for the fundamental resonant mode excitation of the
proposed monopole; this behavior is owing to the embedded chip inductor
compensating for the increased capacitance seen at the feeding point with
the decreasing strip’s resonant length. The SAR of the proposed monopole
placed at the bottom position of the mobile phone is found to meet the SAR
limit for practical applications.

slots. The different coupling effects of the slotted structure make it controllable for the excitation of a quarter-wavelength resonant modes at
about 1795, 1920, and 2045 MHz, respectively. The two excited resonant bands cover GSM and DCS/PCS/UMTS operations for the proposed antenna in this study.

It has been known that, by embedding a chip inductor, the monopole
can have decreased resonant length for achieving its fundamental or
lowest resonant mode excitation [1]–[3]. This behavior is owing to the
additional inductance contributed by the embedded chip inductor to
compensate for the increased capacitance resulting from the decreased
resonant length of the antenna. Related works on the shortened dipole
and monopole with this kind of inductive loading have also been available in the open literature. They include the shortened dipole with the
inductive element placed in series with each radiating arm of the dipole
[4] and the multi-branch monopole with one of its branches end-loaded
with a dense meandered section as the inductive end section [5]. It has
also been shown that the chip inductor should be embedded near the
feeding point of the monopole [1] where the excited surface currents
are strong for the fundamental resonant mode. In this case, the required
resonant length is usually less than 0.2 wavelength for generating the
fundamental resonant mode of the monopole. Also, it is found that the
required resonant length of the second resonant mode of the monopole
will be decreased as well such that the frequency ratio of the first two
resonant modes maintains about 1 to 3, similar to that of the traditional
monopole or dipole [6]–[8]. Hence, in order to obtain two wide bands
at about 900 and 1900 MHz to cover GSM850/900/1800/1900/UMTS
wireless wide area network (WWAN) operation, two separate radiating
strips are usually required for the internal WWAN antenna for mobile
phone applications [1], [9].
In this communication, we propose a printed single-strip monopole
using a chip inductor for penta-band WWAN operation in the mobile
phone. The embedded chip inductor can result in a decreased resonant
length for the fundamental resonant mode excitation of the monopole.
It can also generate an additional resonant mode such that the first two

resonant modes of the monopole can be adjusted to have a frequency
ratio of about 1 to 2 to respectively cover the desired wide 900 and
1900 MHz bands for GSM850/900 (824–894/880–960 MHz) and
GSM1800/1900/UMTS (1710–1880/ 1850–1990/1920–2170 MHz)
operation. This behavior of dual-band operation is similar to that of
using an LC resonator applied to a PIFA [10] and that of using an
inductive element loaded in each radiating arm of a dipole [4]. In this
study, the use of a chip inductor applied to a single-strip monopole
leads to a simple uniplanar structure with a small planar printed area

(about 250
smaller than that of the traditional two-strip monopoles for penta-band
WWAN operation in the mobile phone that have been reported (about

in [1] and 420
in [9]). In addition, the uniplanar
350
structure of the antenna is very promising for thin-profile or slim
mobile phone applications [11]–[17], which is becoming attractive for
the mobile users. Also, when arranging the antenna to be at the bottom
position of the mobile phone, the simulated SAR (specific absorption
rate) [18]–[22] is found to meet the limit of 1.6 W/kg for 1-g head
tissue and 2.0 W/kg for 10-g head tissue.

Fig. 1 shows the geometry of the proposed antenna, which is mainly
an inverted-L strip monopole embedded with a chip inductor of L

separates the strip
into two sections: a front section and an end section. The two sections

in this study. On the back side of the circuit board, a system ground

is printed. The dimensions of the system cirplane of 100 2 60
cuit board and ground plane are reasonable for practical mobile phones,
especially for smartphones.
The total length of the antenna from the feeding point A, through the
chip inductor, to the open end has a length of about 57 mm only (about
0.17 wavelength at 900 MHz). Although the strip length is less than
0.25 wavelength at 900 MHz, a wideband resonant mode covering the
GSM850/900 bands can be generated. This behavior is owing to the

additional inductance contributed by the chip inductor to compensate
for the increased capacitance with decreased resonant strip length.
On the other hand, at higher frequencies around 1900 MHz, the chip
inductor provides a large inductive reactance such that the front section
of length about 38 mm (about 0.24 wavelength at 1900 MHz) sees a virtual open circuit at the chip-inductor position. This condition leads to
the excitation of a new quarter-wavelength mode at about 1900 MHz,
which shows a wide bandwidth to cover GSM1800/1900/UMTS bands.
Note that the wide bandwidths of the first two resonant modes of the
antenna at about 900 and 1900 MHz are mainly resulted from the selection of widened widths (7.0 and 4.5 mm here) of the front and end
sections. It has been shown that by increasing the width of the strip
monopole, the antenna’s impedance matching can be improved, and
hence the obtained bandwidth can be widened [23].

Note that the antenna occupies a printed area of about 250
only. Owing to the small printed area, there is a large portion unused
and available in the no-ground portion of the circuit board for accommodating the associated elements such as the speaker [24], [25], the
lens of the digital camera [26], and so on. For testing the antenna in
the experiment, a 50- microstrip feedline printed on the front side of
the circuit board and connected through a via-hole to a 50- SMA connector on the back side of the circuit board is used. The obtained results
are presented in Section III.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Fig. 2 shows the measured and simulated return loss for the proposed
antenna. Good agreement between the measured data and the simulated
results obtained from Ansoft HFSS [27] is obtained. Two wideband
resonant modes at about 900 and 1900 MHz are obtained. The first and
second modes provide wide bandwidths of 155 MHz (810–965 MHz)
and 515 MHz (1675–2190 MHz) to cover the GSM850/900 and
GSM1800/1900/UMTS bands, respectively, for WWAN operation.
Fig. 3 shows the simulated return loss for the proposed antenna, the
case without the chip inductor (Ref 1), and the case with a chip inductor
of 10 nH placed near the feeding point (Ref 2). Ref 1 can be consid2
ered as a simple monopole using a connecting strip of 1.0 2 1.0
to replace the chip inductor in the proposed antenna. It is seen that the
lowest mode of Ref 1 occurs at about 1100 MHz, higher than those of
the proposed antenna and Ref 2. In addition, the second mode of Ref
1 occurs at about 3300 MHz; that is, the first two modes have a frequency ratio of about 1 to 3. For Ref 2, with the chip inductor having
than that in the proposed antenna,
a smaller inductance of L
the lowest mode can also occur at about 900 MHz, similar to the proposed antenna. Note that when the chip inductance has an inductance
of 27 nH, the same as that in the proposed antenna, the lowest mode
can be shifted to lower frequencies at about 700 MHz. Also, the second
mode of Ref 2 occurs at about 2800 MHz, about three times that of the
lowest mode. That is, both the first two modes of Ref 1 and Ref 2 have

a frequency ratio of about 1 to 3, similar to the traditional monopole.
Hence, an additional strip is required to generate a resonant mode at
about 1900 MHz to cover the GSM1800/1900/UMTS bands. A longer
strip is also required for Ref 1 to generate a resonant mode for operating in the 900 MHz band.
Fig. 4 shows the simulated return loss as a function of the inductance
L of the chip inductor. The increasing inductance causes the lowering
of both the first two modes, and a frequency ratio of about 1 to 2 is maintained. It is noted that when a larger inductance is used, the obtained
bandwidth of the lowest mode is decreased with the decreasing of its
resonant frequency. Fig. 5 shows the simulated return loss as a function
of the end-portion length d. In this case, when the length d varies, the
total length of the antenna also varies. It is seen that, with the front-section length fixed as 23 mm, the second mode at about 1900 MHz is very
slightly affected for various lengths of d from 10 to 20 mm. On the other
hand, the lowest mode is shifted to lower frequencies when the length
d increases. However, the impedance matching is also degraded when
the lowest mode is shifted to lower frequencies. The results obtained
in Figs. 4 and 5 indicate that the desired lower and upper modes of the
antenna can be effectively controlled by adjusting the inductance L of
the chip inductor and the length d of the end section.
The radiation patterns of the proposed antenna are studied, and
good agreement between the measured and simulated patterns is
obtained. Dipole-like pattern is seen at 925 MHz for the 900 MHz
band, while more directivity is obtained for the pattern at 1920 MHz

for the 1900 MHz band. The obtained radiation patterns including the
polarization information are similar to those of the two-strip monopole
obtained in [1] and those of the conventional internal mobile phone
antennas [28].
The measured radiation efficiency and antenna gain are shown
in Fig. 6. The radiation efficiency varies from 55 to 88% for
the GSM850/900 bands [see Fig. 7(a)] and from 65 to 96% for
the GSM1800/1900/UMTS bands [see Fig. 7(b)]. The antenna
gain is 0.4–1.8 dBi and 2.07–4.8 dBi for the GSM850/900 and
GSM1800/1900/UMTS bands, respectively. The obtained radiation
characteristics with efficiency better than 55% are sufficient (generally
required to be larger than 50% over the bands) for practical mobile
phone applications.

the mobile phone. The SAR distributions in the figure are normalized; 0 dB indicates the maximum SAR value.

The SAR results are analyzed with the aid of the SAR simulation
model provided by SEMCAD [29]. The simulation model is shown in
Fig. 7, and the simulated normalized SAR distributions on the phantom
head for the proposed antenna at the bottom position of the mobile
phone are shown in the figure. Note that it has been shown that this kind
of internal mobile phone antenna (no ground plane below or behind
the antenna’s radiating portion) is more suitable to be placed at the
bottom position of the mobile phone to achieve decreased SAR values
[1], [22]. In the simulation model, the system ground plane is spaced
5 mm from the phantom ear, and the mobile phone is oriented 60 to
the vertical axis of the phantom head. The testing power is 24 dBm at
859 and 925 MHz, and 21 dBm at 1795, 1920 and 2045 MHz [1], [22].
From the results, the obtained SAR values for 1-g (10-g) head tissue
are 1.25 (0.93), 1.08 (0.79), 0.68 (0.44), 0.60 (0.37) and 0.50 (0.31)
W/kg at 859, 925, 1795, 1920, and 2045 MHz, respectively, which all
meet the SAR limitation of 1.6 (2.0) W/kg [19]. Also note that there
are two local SAR maxima observed at 1795, 1920 and 2045 MHz,
which indicates that the antenna’s near-field radiation energy is more
uniformly distributed; this behavior results in decreased SAR values.
The obtained SAR results for the proposed antenna are also about the
same as those of the two-strip monopole antenna obtained in [1].
IV. CONCLUSION
A simple printed monopole using a chip inductor for achieving a frequency ratio of about 1 to 2 for its first two modes and moreover obtaining
a small resonant length of about 0.17 wavelength for its first mode for
WWAN operation in the mobile phone has been proposed. With a simple
2
structure, the antenna requires a small printed area of about 250
only. The antenna’s first two modes can be controlled to occur at about
900 and 1900 MHz to cover GSM850/900 and GSM1800/1900/UMTS
bands. Good radiation characteristics over the five operating bands have
been observed. The SAR of the antenna mounted at the bottom position
of the mobile phone has been conducted. The obtained SAR values
meet the requirements for practical applications.
