Jaume Anguera, Senior Member, IEEE, Iván Sanz, Josep Mumbrú, and Carles Puente, Member, IEEE

Abstract—A handset antenna technique combining a parallel excitation of a PIFA and a slot is presented. The number of frequency
bands is given by the sum of bands given per each radiator which
can be controlled independently. Component interaction (battery,
display, and speaker) is analyzed to determine the best place to
mitigate performance degradation. Finally, a concept featuring a
small footprint (39 11 mm2 ) and low profile (2 mm) is proposed
for multiband operation.
Index Terms—Component interaction, handset antennas, multiband, planar inverted F antenna (PIFA), slot, specific absorption
rate (SAR).

I. INTRODUCTION

NE of the decisive aspects of a portable radio device, such
as for instance a hand-held telephone or a wireless device is its volume and size. From the consumer perception, the
overall volume, mechanical design, ergonomics and aesthetics
of the phone are decisive. There is an increased trend in making
thinner phones that can better fit inside a shirt or jacket pocket
or a bag or case.
This need in making smaller, thinner phones enters into
conflict with the trend of adding more features to the phone.
On one hand, phones are increasingly adding components and
features such as large color screens, digital cameras, digital
music players, digital and analogue radio and multimedia
) and come with a
broadcast receivers (FM/AM, DVB-H,
wider range of form factors (bar phones, clamshell phones,
flip-phones, slider phones, ). On the other hand, new cellular
and wireless services are being added, which in some cases
means that multiband capabilities are required (to feature
several standards such as for instance GSM850, GSM900,
GSM1800, GSM1900, UMTS) or that other connectivity components (for instance for Bluetooth, IEEE802, WiFi, WiMax,
ZigBee, Ultrawideband). All these trends put an increasing
pressure on the antenna specifications, which need to feature
a small footprint, a thin mechanical profile, yet performing
efficiently at several frequency bands [1]–[16].

Several techniques employing PIFA and slots have already
appeared in the literature. In [17] authors present a slot on the
ground plane to make the ground plane resonant at the same frequency than the PIFA. This way, a broadband behavior covering
is obtained,
from 800–1230 MHz approximately
that is, an antenna that fulfills at least the standards GSM850
(824–894 MHz) and GSM900 (880–960 MHz). In [18] a similar approach using a resonating ground plane is shown (design
).
covers from 750 to 1250 MHz approximately,
In [19], a design using multiple slots on the ground plane is
studied in order to achieve a multiband behavior. In spite of
the good reflection coefficient results, the proposed structure is
difficult to be integrated into a handset phone due to battery,
displays, and speakers, among others that can short-out the slots
effect. To overcome the component integration problem, in
[20]–[23] a similar design is proposed using a slot underneath
the antenna area. The slot has two objectives: on the one hand
to tune the ground plane to resonate at lower bands (around
900 MHz) as in [17], [18] obtaining a broadband behavior:
(GSM850-900); on the other hand, the slot is designed in such a
way that operates as a parasitic antenna resonating at the upper
band (1900 MHz). With a proper coupling between the slot and
the PIFA [22], the bandwidth at the upper band is improved
achieving GSM1800 (1710–1880 MHz), 1900 (1850–1990
MHz), and UMTS (1920–2170 MHz).
Characteristic modes [24] have been used to give a good understanding on how the ground plane can be used to enhance the
behavior of a handset antenna [25]–[27].
Other techniques have been proposed in [28]. In this case,
the slot in not printed on the ground plane but embedded on
the PIFA geometry. This technique creates an extra mode
which enhances the bandwidth at the upper band covering from
GSM900-1800 for the original design to GSM900-1800 and
1900 for the embedded-slot design.
In [29] a multiband low profile handset designed only with
slot antennas is analyzed. Slots are not only useful to antenna
design but also for damping undesired modes for EMC purposes
[30]. Finally, other solutions employing monopole antenna for
multiband purposes can be found in [31].
The objective of the paper is to present a handset antenna
technique that combines a PIFA and a slot suitable for slim-profile and multiband cell-phones [32]–[34]. Although PIFA is not
low profile compared with a slot-type antenna, the ground plane
underneath facilitates component integration as it is demonstrated in this paper. This paper is a detailed extension as well as
new data (component interaction) of the author’s previous work
presented in [34]. A similar concept based on a parallel excitation of two different antenna types (slot and monopole) can

be found in [35] which also demonstrates to be very useful for
multiband performance.
The paper is structured as follows: Section II explains the antenna concept. In Section III, simulation gives a physical insight
into the antenna behavior. Component interaction (battery, display, and speaker) is analyzed in Section IV. Section V presents
a low-profile design covering GSM900, 1800, 1900, UMTS, and
S-DMB (2630–2655 MHz). Reflection coefficient, efficiency,
radiation patterns, as well as SAR (specific absorption rate) results are shown. Finally, Section VI summarizes the work.

One of the techniques to obtain multiband behavior for
handset antennas is to create several resonant paths [2], [16].
Parasitic elements or increasing height may be used to enlarge
bandwidth. However both techniques increase antenna volume
which is especially prohibitive for the new generation of slim
phones. Some solutions remove the ground plane under the
antenna area resulting in a monopole type antenna. For these
particular cases, once the ground plane under the antenna has
been removed, cell-phone components such a camera, vibrator
or speaker may degrade the antenna behavior [22]. The antenna
technique presented here overcomes the problem of the small
bandwidth for low profile PIFA and facilitates component
integration.
An illustration on how the concept works is shown next.
Fig. 1(a) depicts a slot on a ground plane having 100 40
mm . In this case, the slot is excited around 1900 MHz. The
.
obtained bandwidth covers GSM1800-UMTS at
Fig. 1(b) shows a 900 MHz PIFA on the same ground plane. The
feeding mechanism is in the same position used to excite the
previous slot. The bandwidth is quite poor as the PIFA height
is only 4 mm. Both designs are combined, that is, the PIFA
and the slot share the same feeding mechanism [Fig. 1(c)]. It
can be observed that the new antenna combines both reflection
coefficients (Fig. 2). It is important to notice that bandwidth
at 900 MHz has been improved. A rationale for this may be
found since some ground plane has been removed under the
PIFA area reducing its quality factor. Another justification may
be explained as the currents follow a larger path due to the slot
on the ground plane. The ground plane wave mode gets closer
to 900 MHz reaching a better bandwidth [17]–[23]. For the
at higher bands is
combined solution, bandwidth
similar as the single slot case. To increase the bandwidth at the
second band, slot width may be increased [36].

For these two examples we can conclude that:

Current distribution on the PIFA and electrical field on the
slot has been computed using the IE3D MoM package to give
an extra physical insight into the behavior of this antenna.
Fig. 5(a)–(c) shows the current distribution at 900, 1900, and
2600 MHz, respectively. It is remarkable that the PIFA is highly
excited at 900 MHz [larger branch at Fig. 5(a)] and at 2600 MHz
[short branch at Fig. 5(c)] whereas it is weakly excited at 1900
MHz. The PIFA modes for both resonances are fundamental

IV. COMPONENT INTERACTION

Since the PIFA has only one branch, used for the low band,
the space can be reused to create a second path, that is, a new
resonant frequency [33]. In this case, a new electrical path has

be DC-connected to the GND, two RF chokes (100 nH) are
introduced to achieve it and at the same time at RF frequencies
the speaker is disconnected. This way, the negative effects
of the speaker are mitigated. Since the results for floating
and RF chokes cases are practically the same, the following
experiments uses the speaker in floating conditions.
The analysis carried out in Figs. 8–11 is explained next.
a) A PIFA-Slot prototype based on Fig. 3(a) operating at
GSM850, 900, 1800, 1900 bands has been designed (see

A thin metallic layer covers the back side of the display
which is facing the slot radiator. It is GND connected.
The reason why the speaker has not been connected to
the PCB is explained using simulations results (Fig. 7). The
radiation efficiency is computed for four particular situations:
without the speaker, with the speaker not connected, with the
speaker connected to GND, and finally the speaker connected
nH. When the speaker is connected
to the GND using
directly to the GND it degrades both lower and upper frequencies because the PIFA has more metallic part underneath
and the slot is shielded. However, when the speaker is not
connected, efficiency at lower frequencies is not degraded since
the speaker is not an extension of the groundplane. The metal
box of the speaker induces more ground effect to high-band
slot and causes a poor efficiency. Since the speaker needs to

It is important to outline that a component may shift reflection coefficient with minor changes in which is true
if the component introduces low losses or not degrades the
antenna radiation; in other situations, a component may
introduce losses or short out the antenna causing reflection coefficient to change and to drop dramatically as
it is shown next.
d) Aforementioned measurements are performed without
components (Fig. 8) and with components at three
different positions (Figs. 9–11). Note: for comparison
purposes, 4 marks are included in all graphs indicating
total efficiency at 824, 960, 1710, and 1990 MHz.
Fig. 9 shows the speaker effect when it is placed above the
slot area. For position 1 neither the reflection coefficient nor
changes. Since the speaker is above the short-edge of the slot,
the effect is negligible, meaning that the speaker may be integrated at this position without affecting antenna. However, as the
speaker moves closer the open edge, there is a dramatic change
at the higher band. This
in reflection coefficient as well as
means that the speaker reduces radiation from the slot. Lower
bands are affected in a much lesser way. This result corroborates data obtained from the simulation: slot is weakly excited
at the lower bands.
and
Fig. 10 depicts the evolution of reflection coefficient,
for the following situations: (a) battery at 9 mm, (b) 5 mm,
and (c) 0 mm from the PIFA inner edge. It is shown that the performance remains almost the same for b and c situations compared to non-component situation. However, at 0 mm, reflection
coefficient at GSM850-900 is shifted to lower frequencies and
drops degrading the antenna behavior. At
at the same time
GSM1800–1900 frequencies, antenna performance is slightly
affected since the battery does not interfere with the slot area.
Fig. 11 explains the display effect when it is placed above
the slot. The effect is pretty much the same as the speaker: to
block the radiation from the slot. It is interesting to outline that in
spite of the acceptable reflection coefficient at GSM1800–1900
bands, is less than 30%. The lower bands are weakly affected.

From this experiment it is concluded that the slot should be kept
free from the display, being this one a critical component.
We can outline that the slot is an attractive solution in terms
of a low profile antenna, but it is sensitive when handset components are close to the slot aperture.
V. SLIM HANDSET ANTENNA FOR MULTIBAND BEHAVIOR
This section illustrates a particular design for pentaband
(GSM900, 1800, 1900, UMTS, and S-DMB) behavior using
the geometry depicted in Fig. 3(b). Physical implementation
is shown in Fig. 12 and Fig. 13. Slot uses a wide aperture to
enhance bandwidth especially at the upper bands (DCS-UMTS
frequencies) since the slot is the antenna operating at these

frequencies. Increasing the slot width may have a lateral
effect on the PIFA at GSM900 frequencies since it has less
ground plane underneath even the slot is not resonating at
GSM900. This way, the PIFA has a partial ground plane
which decreases its quality factor, that is, more bandwidth
may be obtained.
A similar explanation may be observed for a partial grounded
microstrip patch. When a slot is placed underneath the microstrip patch, it reduces the quality factor, and therefore the
bandwidth of the antenna is increased [37].
More research needs to be done to include GSM850 band
which should be achieved by either increasing slot width, PIFA
height, or using broad banding networks.

SAR passive testing is indicative of a preliminary measure
since SAR is finally tested with an active device. However, it
is interesting to test in a passive way to analyze if the antenna
may pose a SAR problem. For example, from this passive data
(Table II and Fig. 17) some conclusions can be obtained.
a) At the low frequencies (900 MHz), the hot-spot (maximum SAR value) is located at the centre of the ground
plane confirming again that the ground plane mode determines radiation. The slot is weakly excited, meaning that
it is not an issue for SAR.
b) At the higher frequencies, the hot-spot in mainly fixed by
the slot on the ground plane since in this case the slot is excited, that is, SAR is more antenna dependent [17]. This
is useful information since SAR can be dramatically reduced at higher bands by placing the antenna at the opposite short edge of the ground plane (180 rotation of the
handset) [22].

Radiation cuts have been measured at 900, 1800, 2100, and

directivity due to the larger electrical size of the ground plane.
Finally, specific absorption rate (SAR) in passive mode has

The concept based on a PIFA-slot has been shown to be useful
to design multiband handset antennas where the number of frequency bands is given by the sum of the bands given by each
radiator. Moreover, said bands can be controlled independently
which adds an extra freedom design.
Component interaction has been analyzed showing that: a)
the speaker mainly affects the slot radiator (introduces mismatch
and losses) but its negative effect can be minimized by placing
the speaker near the short-edge of the slot, b) battery affects the
PIFA causing a detuning and introduce losses, c) the display is a
critical component which should keep the slot free. This means
that for planar handset antennas such as monopoles or slots,
component interaction should be carefully taken into account.
Although PIFA type occupies more space, components can be
placed at the other part of the ground plane with a minimum
impact on the performance of the antenna.
Thanks to the slot radiator, the PIFA volume can be reused
to add more bands; for this research, an extra band centered
at S-DBM has been added to finally design a pentaband prototype at GSM900, 1800, 1900, UMTS, and S-DMB. The total
antenna volume results in only 39 11 2(h) mm . Results
for total efficiency taking into account several components (battery, display, speaker, camera, and phone covers) are satisfactory
and make this concept very attractive for the new generation of
low-profile multiband handset phones.
