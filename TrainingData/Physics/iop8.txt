We present a scheme that produces a strong U(1)-like gauge field on
cold atoms confined in a two-dimensional square optical lattice. Our proposal
relies on two essential features, a long-lived metastable excited state that exists
for alkaline-earth or ytterbium atoms and an optical superlattice. As in the
proposal by Jaksch and Zoller (2003 New J. Phys. 5 56), laser-assisted tunneling
between adjacent sites creates an effective magnetic field. In the tight-binding
approximation, atomic motion is described by the Harper Hamiltonian, with a
flux across each lattice plaquette that can realistically take any value between
0 and π. We show how one can take advantage of the superlattice to ensure
that each plaquette acquires the same phase, thus simulating a uniform magnetic
field. We discuss the observable consequences of the artificial gauge field on
non-interacting bosonic and fermionic gases. We also outline how the scheme
can be generalized to non-Abelian gauge fields.

1. Introduction

The fractional quantum Hall phases realized by two-dimensional (2D) electron gases in very
large magnetic fields are among the most intriguing states of matter (see, for instance, [1]). In
such systems, electrons ‘bind’ to magnetic vortices, forming strongly correlated phases with
striking properties, such as exotic excitations (‘anyons’), which obey fractional statistics [2].
Analogous quantum Hall phases should also arise in cold atomic gases when they are set
into fast rotation (see [3] and references therein). Owing to the mathematical similarity
between Coriolis and Lorentz forces, rotating neutral gases are indeed the exact analogue
of an assembly of charged particles plunged in a magnetic field. Observing these highly
correlated phases is one of the major goals in the field of trapped quantum gases [3, 4].
This goal has, however, not yet been reached, because of the difficulty of communicating the
required amount of angular momentum (on the order of N h¯ per atom, with N the number of
particles) to the system [5, 6]. In practice, residual static trap anisotropy limits the total angular
momentum to much smaller values, for which the rotating gas is well described by a mean field
approach [7].
Recently, alternative schemes of ‘simulating’ artificial gauge fields for neutral atoms have
been explored using 2D optical lattices [8]–[14]. As they do not involve any mechanical rotation
of the system, they should be less sensitive to the imperfection of the trapping potential and thus
easier to implement. The guideline for these proposals is the celebrated Harper model [15, 16],
defined by the 2D single-particle Hamiltonian,

neighbors in the absence of a magnetic field. The effect of a vector potential (here in the Landau
gauge, A = −Byex ) is included in the so-called Peierls phase factor, 2παm, where α = eBd 2 / h
is the flux per unit cell expressed in units of the flux quantum φ0 = h/e. The Harper Hamiltonian
in equation (1) has been studied extensively in the literature (see e.g. [15]–[18]). For zero flux,
the Harper model reduces to a standard tight-binding model on a square lattice, with a single
Bloch band of width 8J . For rational fluxes α = p/q (where p and q are integers), the model
is still periodic but with larger unit cells of size qd × d. The Bloch band splits into q magnetic
sub-bands, and the ground state becomes q-fold degenerate. This results in the peculiar selfsimilar structure in an energy–magnetic flux diagram known as Hofstadter’s butterfly [16]. This
structure exists in a strict sense for infinitely extended systems. For a finite system of size L, the
details of this structure are washed out on fine scales such that q > L/d.
In their seminal proposition for an implementation of (1) [8], Jaksch and Zoller (JZ)
suggested that the phase 2π α can be imprinted by a laser beam inducing hopping between
adjacent sites (see also [9]–[14] for alternative proposals). A major advantage of this approach
is that large flux α ∼ 1 can be reached under experimentally realistic conditions. For a filling
factor with ∼1 atom per site, the quantum Hall regime then becomes reachable in the presence
of moderate atomic interactions [11], [19]–[22]. Theoretical studies have found that some of
these phases are essentially similar to those encountered in the bulk [11, 19, 20, 22], whereas
others are without counterparts in the bulk phase [23, 24].
Although the existing proposals for implementing the Harper Hamiltonian with atomic
quantum gases open many avenues, they are still challenging from an experimental point of
view (for reasons discussed in detail below). In this paper, we extend the JZ proposal and
discuss a new scheme based on an optical superlattice [25, 26] to generate a gauge potential
leading to (1). At variance with earlier works where alkali atoms were considered, here we
propose using atoms with a long-lived metastable excited state, such as alkaline-earth [27]–[29]
or ytterbium [30, 31] atoms. For concreteness we will discuss the case of ytterbium, for which
degenerate gases have already been produced for both bosonic and fermionic isotopes [30, 31].
We take advantage of this level structure to alleviate many practical difficulties encountered with
alkalis. Importantly, our scheme uses only building blocks that have already been individually
demonstrated.
This paper is organized as follows. We first introduce the system, consisting of atoms
with a ground state g and a long-lived metastable excited state e trapped in a 2D lattice. The
optical lattice is tuned near an ‘anti-magic’ wavelength where the polarizabilities of e and g are
opposite [32]. The two internal states thus live in spatially separated sublattices. We show that
the case α = 1/2, leading to Dirac points analogous to those appearing in graphene [33], can be
achieved rather simply with a single laser beam coupling e and g. We then extend our scheme to
generate arbitrary values of α using an optical superlattice, at the expense of several lasers
operating at different frequencies. Subsequently, we address the influence of the additional
potential that must be added to confine the particles. We investigate its effect by looking at
(i) the density of states that determines the density profile of a trapped ideal Fermi gas and (ii)
the ground state of the system, relevant for non-interacting bosons. In both cases, we obtain a
clear signature for a nonzero value of α. We conclude by indicating how the method can be
generalized to generate non-Abelian gauge fields [34].

wavelength λm ≈ 760 nm and an ‘anti-magic’ wavelength λam ≈ 1.12 µm. (c)

states identically. The x lattice is tuned near the ‘anti-magic’ wavelength and
confines the two states in two distinct sublattices shifted by λam /4.

2. Two-electron atoms in state-dependent optical lattices

Two-electron atoms, such as ytterbium and alkaline-earth atoms, generally have a spin-singlet
(1 S0 ≡ g) ground state and an extremely long-lived spin triplet (3 P0 ≡ e) excited state (see
figure 1(a)). The very long lifetime of e (around 20 s for Yb [35]) allows one to operate
optical atomic clocks at the resonance wavelength λ0 ≈ 578 nm between g and e [36]–[38].
It has also inspired novel proposals for quantum information processing [39]–[41] or quantum
simulation [42, 43]. States g and e usually react differently to far-off resonance laser light, as
they couple optically to many different states. The polarizabilities of the two states calculated
using the data from [44] are shown in figure 1(b). For laser light tuned at the so-called magic
wavelength λm (∼760 nm for Yb), both states have the same polarizability and feel the same
optical trapping potential [45]. Central to our proposal is the existence of an ‘anti-magic’
wavelength λam ≈ 1.12 µm [32], for which the polarizabilities of g and e are opposite2,3 . As
we will see, this allows one to create easily internal-state-dependent potentials.

There exists another anti-magic wavelength near 620 nm, which is unfortunately rather close to a transition
connecting to the 3 P0 state (649 nm). A lattice at this wavelength is thus likely to suffer from excessive spontaneous
emission.
3
A many-electron calculation [46] using more accurate parameters for the positions and widths of the optical
transitions predicts the anti-magic wavelengths near 1120.3 nm and 618.7 nm (Derevianko A 2009 Private
communication).

The first building block of our proposal consists in a laser beam at the magic wavelength,
forming a horizontal light sheet that freezes the vertical motion of the atoms irrespective of
their internal state e or g. From now on, we shall focus on the atom dynamics in the horizontal
x y plane. The second ingredient consists in an optical standing wave along the y-axis, also
at the magic wavelength, which generates the same potential V (y) = −V0 cos2 (π y/d y ) for
both states g and e (V0 > 0). For the third building block, we apply another optical standing
wave at the ‘anti-magic’ wavelength λam along the x-axis, generating the potential V (x) =
±V1 cos2 (π x/2dx ), where the + and − signs refer to e and g, respectively. The resulting
potential V (x) + V (y) creates two shifted sublattices (see figure 1(c)). Atoms in state g sit
at positions rg = (2n, m) and atoms in state e at positions re = (2n + 1, m), where n, m are
integers. Here we take as length scales dx = λam /4 along x, and d y = λm /2 along y. We write
the Wannier functions for the lowest Bloch band as wg (r − rg ) and we (r − re ). The potential
V0 is chosen such that the tunneling energy J (y) along the vertical lines is significant. On the
contrary, we choose V1 large enough to neglect direct tunneling along the x-axis.
Tunneling along the x-axis is induced by a coherent optical coupling between g and e.
Since atoms in e and g are trapped in separate optical lattices, this coupling induces hopping
from one sublattice to the other. Following Jaksch and Zoller [8], we calculate the effective
g − e hopping matrix element between two neighboring sites located at rg = (2n, m) and
re = rg + b = (2n + 1, m) as

with
and q the laser Rabi frequency and wavevector. We assume that the coupling laser
propagates in the yz plane, so that q · rg = 2παm, where |α| can take any value between 0
and λm /2λ0 ( 0.66 for Yb) by adjusting the angle between the coupling laser beam and the
z-axis.
Before proceeding with further analysis, let us give some numerical estimates for the
different physical quantities involved in this experimental configuration. The anti-magic
wavelength λam corresponds, for Yb, to a recoil energy E R / h = h/(2mλ2am ) ≈ 900 Hz. Realistic
values up to several tens of kHz can be achieved for the depth of the optical lattice potential
V1 / h. In order to avoid excitations to higher-lying Bloch bands, the Rabi frequency must
be small compared to /h¯ , where is the energy gap between the ground and first excited
bands. To give numerical estimates, we take V1 = 20E R , corresponding to a gap ≈ 8E R .
Assuming a moderate Rabi frequency = E R /h¯ , we find a laser-induced tunneling energy
Jeg(x) ≈ 0.05E R , much larger than the residual tunneling energy in each sublattice without change
(x)
in internal state, Jgg
= Jee(x) ≈ 2.5 × 10−3 E R . In principle, besides resonant transitions between
the fundamental bands of the two sublattices, the coupling laser also induces second-order
tunneling processes, where an atom tunnels to a neighboring site in a given sublattice, via a
virtual transition to an intermediate excited band in the other sublattice. We have verified that
(x)
the corresponding tunneling rates were negligible compared to Jgg
for the range of parameters
investigated here. Finally, one can calculate the spontaneous emission and associated heating
rates for atoms in each sublattice [47]. For lattice depths V0 = V1 ∼ 30E R , we find the total

heating rates γh ∼ 0.4 nK s−1 and γh(e) ∼ 0.9 nK s−1 , respectively, or γh /E R ∼ 0.01 s−1 and
γh(e) /E R ∼ 0.02 s−1 . The heating rates (dominated by the vertical arm at λm ) are small enough
to maintain atoms in the ground band for several seconds.

magnetic fields. (a) The figure shows the different on-site energies along x, in
the case of a simple-period lattice. All transition frequencies are degenerate,
so that a single laser beam at frequency ωL is sufficient to couple all sites
across the lattice. (b) Staggered effective magnetic field for a single coupling

ω− propagating along −y), one obtains a ‘rectified’ uniform magnetic field.
3. State-dependent lattice: Harper Hamiltonian for α = 1/2

We first consider the simplest experimental arrangement, with a spin-dependent lattice as
described above and a single coupling laser (figure 2(a)). The two-component g − e quantum
gas, which is assumed to populate the lowest Bloch band only, is described by the Hamiltonian

when the lattice amplitudes are adjusted so that J (y) = Jeg(x) = J . As in [8], the operator cˆ n,m
creates an atom at site (n, m), the parity of n identifying the internal state unambiguously.
Alternatively, the internal degrees of freedom can be eliminated by going to a dressed state
basis, and the spatial wavefunctions associated with each dressed state obey the same Harper
equation [15, 16] as the one derived from (1). Hence, at least in the absence of interactions

(which we assume throughout this paper), the internal state is merely a label that can be ignored
in the analysis.
In the original equation (1), the phase picked up across each link has the same
sign for a given link direction in real space: e+i2π αm in the +x-direction and e−i2π αm in the
−x-direction. Here, we find in contrast that the phase is tied to the direction in internal
space: e+i2παm for g → e transitions and e−i2π αm for e → g transitions. In real space, given
the sublattice geometry, this corresponds to a phase that alternates in sign from an arbitrary
unit cell (or ‘plaquette’) to the neighboring one along the x-axis. More precisely, consider
a particle going clockwise around an elementary cell (figure 1(c)). The phase picked up
along the path (2n, m − 1)g → (2n, m)g → (2n + 1, m)e → (2n + 1, m − 1)e → (2n, m − 1)g is
the product of the two factors ei2παm e−i2π α(m−1) = ei2π α . Thanks to the phase factor ∝ eiq·rg , a
particle making a loop around a plaquette acquires a nonzero global phase factor, reflecting the
nonzero ‘magnetic flux’ through the cell. However, for the adjacent plaquette, the path (also with
clockwise orientation) (2n + 1, m − 1)e → (2n + 1, m)e → (2n + 2, m)g → (2n + 2, m − 1)g →
(2n + 1, m − 1)e leads to a phase factor e−i2π α opposite to the previous one. One then achieves
in this way a staggered magnetic field, with a phase per plaquette ±2πα constant on a given
column and changing sign from one column to the next (figure 2(b)).
The case α = 21 is peculiar, since in this case a staggered or a uniform flux both correspond
to a tunneling phase e±i2παm = (−1)m alternating between adjacent links depending on the parity
of m. The Hamiltonian remains periodic, with a unit cell dx × 2d y and two sites per unit cell.
The energy spectrum is given by
E(k x , k y ) = ±2J cos2 (k x dx ) + cos2 (k y d y ),

(4)

where the Bloch vector (k x , k y ) sits in the first Brillouin zone ] −π/dx , π/dx ] ×
] −π/2d y , π/2d y ]. We note that this dispersion relation gives rise to two ‘Dirac points’
for (k x , k y ) = (±π/2dx , π/2d y ) around which the dispersion relation is linear [13, 48] (see
also [49]–[53] for discussions of the Dirac points occurring in different settings, such as
hexagonal lattices or non-Abelian gauge fields). The physical consequences of the existence
of these Dirac points are similar to those found in the case of graphene [33]. However, their
topological robustness [54] might be affected by small deviations from α = 1/2 that break the
two-site periodicity.
For α = 21 , the staggered value of the phase per plaquette leads to a Hamiltonian that is
different from (1), and that, in fact, does not exhibit any structure reminiscent of Hofstader’s
butterfly [55]. This can be linked to a general argument due to Haldane [56], emphasizing
that breaking time-reversal invariance symmetry is the key factor to generating systems with
properties similar to (integer) quantum Hall phases. The situation considered up to this point,
where the same laser beam drives all g → e transitions, is invariant with respect to time reversal.
We describe in the next section a means to break this invariance and achieve a flux with a
constant sign on all plaquettes.
4. State-dependent superlattice: Harper Hamiltonian for arbitrary α

4.1. Flux rectification
To ensure an identical phase 2π α per plaquette, instead of the staggered values ±2πα, we
consider a situation where the on-site energies are modulated spatially along x with a period
New Journal of Physics 12 (2010) 033007 (http://www.njp.org/)

8
equal to twice the lattice spacing, as depicted in figure 2(c) (the y lattice remains identical for
both states and is ignored in the following). Assume that the on-site energies are modulated
according to
E g − V1

for x/dx = 4n,

E e + V2

for x/dx = 4n + 1,

E g − V1 − V2
Ee

for x/dx = 4n + 2,

for x/dx = 4n + 3.

Here the E α (α = e, g) denote the internal energies in free space, where V1 is the amplitude of
the fundamental lattice with period dx and where V2 V1 is the amplitude of the modulation
with period 2dx . In this potential landscape, the resonance frequencies for transitions linking
neighboring sites become non-degenerate (figure 2(c)),
ω+ = ω0 + (V1 + V2 )/h¯
ω− = ω0 + (V1 + 2V2 )/h¯
ω+ = ω0 + (V1 + V2 )/h¯
ω− = ω0 + V1 /h¯

for |g; 4n, m → |e; 4n + 1, m ,
for |e; 4n + 1, m → |g; 4n + 2, m ,
for |g; 4n + 2, m → |e; 4n + 3, m ,

for |e; 4n + 3, m → |g; 4n + 4, m ,

with h¯ ω0 = E e − E g .
To the state-dependent lattice, one thus applies three coupling lasers propagating along y
with frequencies ω+ , ω− and ω− . The laser at frequency ω+ is chosen with a wavevector kL ,
and the lasers at frequencies ω− and ω− with the opposite wavevector −kL . The alternance
of the wavevectors compensates the alternance of the plaquette phases, thereby ‘rectifying’
the staggered flux obtained in a single-frequency configuration. If we neglect off-resonant
transitions, an analysis similar to that made in the previous section confirms that each plaquette
now acquires the same phase factor ei2π α , and that the system is indeed described by the Harper
Hamiltonian (1).
4.2. Optical superlattice
To realize such a modulation in practice, we propose superimposing along the x-direction
an additional lattice potential with a double spatial period 2λam , which can be written as
V (x) = Vg/e cos2 (π x/4dx + ϕ), where ϕ is the relative phase between the fundamental and
double period lattices4 . Such superlattice potentials have been demonstrated experimentally for
quantum gases [25, 26]. This potential can be realized in practice by adding a second laser
with frequency c/2λam phase locked to the fundamental lattice to control the relative phase
ϕ [26]. The amplitudes Vg/e depend on the internal state and are fixed by the initial choice
of wavelength for the fundamental lattice. The analysis in section 4.1 (where Vg = Ve ) can
be generalized straightforwardly to this less symmetric potential, with four non-degenerate
transition frequencies in the general case. Moreover, it is possible to reduce the number of
required laser frequencies to three by using a particular value of the relative phase ϕ that
reproduces exactly the scheme described previously, with V2 = Ve cos ϕ − Vg sin ϕ.
Practically, the fluctuations δϕ of ϕ must be small enough to ensure that fluctuations of V2 remain much smaller
than the width of the g − e resonance, set by the Rabi frequency , or δϕ h¯ /V2 0.1. This is well within
present technological capabilities.

4.3. Conditions of validity
We now discuss the domain of validity of our model.
• Firstly, as in the previous sections, we demand that laser-assisted tunneling dominates over
regular tunneling without a change in internal state. For a superlattice potential in the tight(x)
binding regime, regular tunneling is suppressed when V2 E R , since Jgg
, Jee(x)
ER.
• Secondly, the ratio h¯ /V2 , with the Rabi frequency characterizing atom–laser coupling,
must remain small to neglect off-resonant transitions and describe the system with an
effective Harper model [8]. In practice, one can use a conservative value h¯ = V2 /10.
• Finally, the modulation V2 must be small enough to avoid excitations to higher-lying
Bloch bands by one of the coupling lasers. A reasonable choice is V2 = /3, where
is the energy gap between the ground and first excited bands for V2 = 0. This guarantees
that transitions mixing different bands are detuned by at least /3. For example, if we
focus on the |e; 4n + 3, m → |g; 4n + 4, m transition, transitions linking the ground and
first excited bands occur at frequencies ω− ± /h¯ . One can check that the detunings for
the different coupling lasers are |V2 ± |, |2V2 ± |, , which are indeed
/3 for the
choice V2 = /3.
We note that in the tight-binding regime, is notably larger than E R , which allows one
to fulfill simultaneously all these conditions while maintaining a substantial value for Jeg(x) . We
summarize our considerations in table 1, where we give typical values for lattice parameters
and laser-assisted tunneling matrix elements in the superlattice configuration. We note that the
(x)
values for Jeg(x) remain sizeable, being on the same order as the tunnel energies Jgg
in the g
sublattice (h¯ = V2 = 0) at moderate depths (∼10E R ).
4.4. Comparison with the JZ proposal
The scheme as described in this paper is inspired by the earlier proposal by Jaksch and Zoller [8].
That proposal was designed for alkali atoms in spin-dependent optical lattices. In this context, g
and e denoted two different hyperfine states in the ground state manifold, and the spin-dependent
optical potential was obtained by exploiting the vector light shift arising in a laser field with
suitable polarization (see [57, 58], for example).
The first difference between our method and the JZ proposal comes from the choice of
two-electron atoms versus ‘one-electron’ alkalis. To obtain a useful spin-dependent lattice for
New Journal of Physics 12 (2010) 033007 (http://www.njp.org/)

10
alkalis demands, in practice, a lattice laser tuned between the D1 and D2 lines, relatively close
to resonance. For light alkalis, such as 6 Li or 40 K, the fine splitting between the D1 and D2
transitions is rather small (less than 1nm), and spontaneous emission rates are too large to
maintain the cloud in the nK regime. The most practical candidate seems to be 87 Rb, which
has only stable bosonic isotopes and would probably still suffer from spurious spontaneous
emission due to the coupling (Raman) lasers or the lattice lasers. The choice of Yb removes all
these drawbacks, by using only far-off resonant lasers and a dissipation-free coupling transition,
and by allowing the study of bosonic and fermionic systems in the same setup.
The use of a superlattice to ensure the same flux for all plaquettes constitutes the second
main difference of our proposal with respect to JZ’s proposal. There, a strong ‘tilting’ potential
independent of the internal state was introduced in order to distinguish |g; 2n, m → |e; 2n ±
1, m . Although this could be done, in principle, using a large static electric field or the light
shift from an intense far-off resonant laser beam, it turns out to be rather challenging from an
experimental point of view5 . In addition, this tilting potential has to be almost perfectly linear
over the extent of the cloud. Otherwise, the various transition frequencies would depend on
space, spoiling the flux uniformity and the scalability of the method. We believe that the use of
a superlattice optical potential will be a more flexible and more reliable tool that can be readily
implemented experimentally.
5. Role of an external trap potential

We now discuss the properties of a system of non-interacting particles described by equation (1)
in order to identify observable consequences of the laser-induced gauge potential. For a uniform
system without trapping potential, and for α = 0, the model reduces to a standard tight-binding
Hamiltonian. The spectrum consists in an allowed energy band of width 8J centered at zero
energy. For the uniform Harper model, without trapping potential but with α = p/q = 0 ( p and
q are integers), the initial Bloch band splits into q magnetic sub-bands separated by well-defined
energy gaps. This results in q distinct peaks in the density of state (DoS—see figures 3(a) and
(b)). In a practical experiment, an additional trapping potential is inevitably present in addition
to the optical lattice. Hence the physical system is both finite and inhomogeneous. This can
strongly affect the properties of the uniform Harper model given in equation (1), but also provide
novel experimental signatures, as we discuss in this section.
5.1. Density of states in the presence of an external trap
We consider here the Harper model in equation (1) with an additional isotropic trapping
potential Vtrap = κ(r/d)2 . Let us recall that, with α = 0, one finds a quasi-continuum of allowed
states in the combined lattice plus external trap, in striking contrast with the uniform case [59].
States with energy lower than 4J are qualitatively similar to the Bloch eigenstates
√ of the uniform
problem. These states are approximately contained in a disk of radius Reff ∼ J/κ . States with
higher energy (which would lie in the bandgap for the uniform system) are well-localized states
The Stark shift from the electric field is proportional to α|E|2 , with α the static polarizability. Using a
configuration where the cloud is offset from the center of the electrodes creating the field, one can create a linear
potential of the form ηx/dx , with η ∼ αU 2 dx /D 3 (D being the distance between the electrodes and U the applied
electrostatic potential difference). For 87 Rb and D ∼ 1 cm, we find that a site-to-site energy offset on the order of
the energy gap , η ∼ /3 ∼ 10 kHz requires U ∼ 50 kV, which is rather challenging to produce.

α = 0 (dashed lines) are also shown for comparison. The logarithmic divergence

calculation (63 × 63 space grid).
offset from the cloud center [60], with an energy mostly determined by the local potential energy
near the turning point. In two dimensions, the density of states saturates at an asymptotic value
of π/κ.
We now address the case with α = p/q = 0. The finiteness of the central region where
tunneling is significant limits the relevant values of q to q < qmax = Reff /d. We consider here
the case α = 1/3 for concreteness. Solving the full model numerically, we find that the trapping
potential has a dominant effect on the DoS and little remains of the initial peak structure (cf
figures 3(b) and (c)). This indicates that global observables (such as thermodynamic quantities)
will not be very sensitive to the presence of the gauge potential. We can understand this behavior
from a semiclassical argument. Indeed, in a local density approximation, the density of states in
a generic power-law potential κ(r/d)γ can be approximated as
ρtrap (E) =

where n (k) = 4J χn (k) is the relation dispersion for the nth magnetic sub-band of the untrapped
system. This can be simplified to

Here SBZ = (2π/d)2 is the surface of the Brillouin zone. For a harmonic potential (γ = 2), the
dependence on the reduced dispersion function χ is mild since it only arises from the upper
bound of the integral: the peculiarities of the spectrum are essentially washed out by the spatial
integration. This can be improved by using a steeper trap with γ > 2, e.g. a quartic potential as
demonstrated in [6].
5.2. Spatial distribution for non-interacting fermions
In the case of non-interacting fermions in a gauge potential, a more sensitive observable is
given by the particle density [22], assuming it can be measured in situ. Indeed, still within a
semiclassical approximation, the spatial density can be written as
d(2) k
f FD
(2π )2

n(r) =
n

n (k) + Vtrap (r ) −

EF ,

where f FD is the Fermi–Dirac distribution at T = 0 and E F is the Fermi energy. We rewrite
this as
d(2) k ∞
n(r) =

is the density of state for the homogeneous system. For low enough temperatures, the clustering
of energy levels in sub-bands in the presence of a gauge potential will result in well-defined
plateaux in the spatial density of the trapped cloud. These plateaux correspond to ‘bandinsulating’ regions, similar to those appearing for other incompressible systems in traps such
as Mott insulators [61, 62]. We have verified this fact in our numerical calculations, as shown
in figure 3(d). We conclude that the in-trap density profile will provide a clear signature of the
gauge potential in the case of fermionic atoms.
5.3. Momentum distribution for non-interacting bosons
With non-interacting bosons, such a signature will be absent, as the atoms will condense into
the lowest single-particle states (for the purpose of this paper, we do not consider interactions).
However, signatures of the gauge potential will appear in reciprocal momentum space, which
can be probed using standard time-of-flight imaging. The dephasing term ei2π αm generates quasimomentum components at the various harmonics of the fundamental period 2πα. As a result,
clear satellite peaks can be observed in the momentum distribution (see figure 4(a)), which
will provide a direct experimental signature for bosonic species. We note, in addition, that the
density distributions corresponding to these eigenstates show periodic structures with period q
(see figure 4(b)), although this signature appears on a much finer scale than in the fermionic
case (thus being more difficult to observe).

potential reveals itself in momentum components at ±2π/3d in the former plot,
and in the fine structures with period 3d in the latter. The confinement strength
is κ/J = 0.005.
6. Conclusion and perspectives

In this article, we have discussed how one can implement Abelian artificial gauge potentials
for Yb (or alkaline-earth) atoms, a scheme valid for bosons and fermions alike. In contrast to
bosonic isotopes with zero total spin, fermionic isotopes have nuclear spin. This potentially
enables one to simulate non-Abelian gauge fields, along the lines proposed by Osterloh
et al [34]. Let us focus for concreteness on the 171 Yb isotope, with nuclear spin I = 12 . In
the presence of a moderate magnetic field of a few tens of gauss, the degeneracy of the
m I = ± 12 states within the e and g manifolds is lifted, giving in general four different internal
transitions, ± 21 → ± 12 and ± 21 → ∓ 12 , with different frequencies. At the expense of using more
laser frequencies and state-dependent lattices along both the x- and y-directions, one can then
arrange for the lasers to imprint different phases depending on the internal state or generate
arbitrary rotations in internal space. As shown in [34], a straightforward generalization of
the Abelian scheme then allows one to engineer non-Abelian gauge potentials. Instead of a
simple phase, hopping from sublattice g to e then corresponds to a rotation in internal space
generated by non-commuting matrices. Combined with interatomic interactions, an entirely
new class of superfluid or strongly correlated systems becomes accessible with ultracold
atoms [34, 53], [63]–[65]. In a wider context, this technique can be used to emulate spin–orbit
coupling, similar to the Rashba interaction ∝ σˆ x · k y − σˆ y · k x in planar semiconductors, or for
the study of strongly interacting, ultracold fermionic matter in a non-Abelian background field,
possibly relevant to high-energy physics.
