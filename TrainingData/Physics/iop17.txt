Abstract. The existence of high-temperature ferromagnetism in thin films and
nanoparticles of oxides containing small quantities of magnetic dopants remains
controversial. Some regard these materials as dilute magnetic semiconductors,
while others think they are ferromagnetic only because the magnetic dopants
form secondary ferromagnetic impurity phases such as cobalt metal or magnetite.
There are also reports in d0 systems and other defective oxides that contain
no magnetic ions. Here, we investigate TiO2 (rutile) containing 1–5% of iron
cations and find that the room temperature ferromagnetism of films prepared
by pulsed-laser deposition is not due to magnetic ordering of the iron. The
films are neither dilute magnetic semiconductors nor hosts to an iron-based
ferromagnetic impurity phase. A new model is developed for defect-related
ferromagnetism, which involves a spin-split defect band populated by charge
transfer from a proximate charge reservoir—in the present case a mixture of Fe2+
and Fe3+ ions in the oxide lattice. The phase diagram for the model shows how
inhomogeneous Stoner ferromagnetism depends on the total number of electrons
Ntot , the Stoner exchange integral I and the defect bandwidth W; the band
occupancy is governed by the d–d Coulomb interaction U. There are regions of
ferromagnetic metal, half-metal and insulator as well as non-magnetic metal and
insulator. A characteristic feature of the high-temperature Stoner magnetism is an
anhysteretic magnetization curve, which is practically temperature independent
below room temperature. This is related to a wandering ferromagnetic axis,
which is determined by local dipole fields. The magnetization is limited by the
defect concentration, not by the 3d doping. Only 1–2% of the volume of the films
is magnetically ordered.

1. Introduction

The magnetism of thin films of transparent oxides doped with a few per cent of 3d ions [1, 2]
has been a subject of intense controversy ever since the first report of high-temperature
ferromagnetism in thin films of cobalt-doped anatase by Matsumoto in 2001 [3]. There are
similar reports of unexpected weak ferromagnetism in other ‘d0 systems’, which contain no 3d
ions [4]–[6]. Almost anhysteretic magnetization curves have been reported for many other films
such as ZnO : Co [7], SnO2 : Fe [8], Cu2 O : Co [9] and In2 O3 : Cr [10]. The TiO2 : Fe system has
been shown to be magnetic in several previous investigations [11]–[18], although the magnetism
of highly perfect films was due to a secondary Fe3 O4 phase [13]; the ferromagnetism of
Cr-doped TiO2 films is found to disappear as the crystalline quality improves [2, 32].
Long-range magnetic order in dilute magnetic oxides is puzzling; the concentration of
magnetic dopant cations lies far below the percolation threshold, and normal superexchange and
double exchange interactions couple nearest-neighbour cations only. Some of the examples are
insulating [19, 20], so exchange mediated by mobile carriers cannot be a general explanation.
Furthermore, the exchange energy density at a few per cent doping is far too small to produce
ferromagnetism at room temperature [21], even if the exchange were as strong as it is in
cobalt, the ferromagnet with the highest known Curie temperature. We really should not be
seeing uniform ferromagnetism at temperatures of many hundreds of degrees in these materials.
Another problem is that the observed magnetization sometimes exceeds the maximum value that
can be associated with ferromagnetically aligned dopant ions [15, 22, 23]. The ferromagnetic
d0 systems [4]–[6], [24]–[29], where there are no magnetic dopants, are the most extreme
examples.
Bulk samples [30, 31] and thin films [32] of the dilute magnetic oxide solid solutions
behave as expected when they are well crystallized and stoichiometric—they are paramagnetic
down to the helium temperature range. Hence, there is a supposition that the ferromagnetic
behaviour of thin-film or nanoparticle samples must be due to ferromagnetic impurity phases
present as inclusions [13, 33] or as uncontrolled contamination, introduced, for example, by
handling samples with steel tweezers [34, 35]. The magnetic moment of a typical thin-film
sample, 10−8 A m2 , corresponds to that of a speck of iron or magnetite a few tens of microns in
size. Clearly, care is needed to avoid the experimental pitfalls associated with measurements
of very small moments [35, 36], whether with a SQUID or an alternating-gradient force
magnetometer. It is also essential to run proper control samples.
We have investigated TiO2 films that were produced in oxidizing or reducing conditions
and doped with different levels of iron. Here, we focus on oxidized films that turn out to have a

significant magnetic moment, although the films contain no iron-based ferromagnetic impurity
phase. The undoped films are not magnetic. Conversion-electron Mössbauer spectroscopy
and magnetic susceptibility measurements show that iron is not directly involved in the
ferromagnetic ordering. Following this experimental demonstration, we then develop a new
general model based on our idea of charge transfer ferromagnetism [37]. Our previous model
for dilute magnetic oxides [21] was a Heisenberg model where ordered moments residing on
the 3d dopant ions interact via magnetic polarons. The present model that we develop here is
a Stoner model, where the 3d ions act as a charge reservoir, but do not necessarily contribute
to the magnetic order. A defect-based impurity band is spontaneously spin split. We show how
the model works, and we calculate its properties at T = 0 K. The phase diagram is rich with
high-temperature ferromagnetism appearing in the half-metallic regions.
2. Experiment

A series of films was prepared by pulsed-laser deposition from sintered targets made from
99.999% pure TiO2 and 95% isotopically enriched 57 Fe2 O3 . The targets had an Fe/(Fe + Ti)
atomic ratio in the range 0–5 at%. Substrates were 5 × 5 × 0.5 mm3 squares of R-cut (1¯ı02)
sapphire, polished on both sides. They were maintained at 750 ◦ C during deposition, in 102
or 10−3 Pa ambient oxygen pressure, using a KrF excimer laser operating at 248 nm and
10 Hz. Laser fluence on the target was 2 J cm−2 . The resulting films were 70–140 nm thick,
with an rms roughness of 2.5 nm. Magnetization measurements were made in a 5 T SQUID
magnetometer, by mounting the samples in drinking straws with no other sample holder. The
57
Fe Mössbauer spectra were collected at room temperature in transmission geometry with a
57
Co (Rh) source. Optical spectra were recorded at room temperature using a Perkin-Elmer
dual-beam spectrophotometer.
3. Results and discussion

Typical x-ray data are shown in figure 1. The films have rutile structure with a 101 texture.
The only perceptible secondary phase in any of the oxidized films deposited at 102 Pa was
antiferromagnetic α-Fe2 O3 , in films with 5% iron. Compositional analysis by EDAX reveals
compositions that are normally within 10% of the nominal one. The optical bandgap of oxidized
films was close to the 3.1 eV expected for rutile TiO2 [38], whereas the bandgap of films
produced in reducing conditions was 3.9–4.2 eV, due to the formation of a Magnéli phase.
For the latter films, there is some indication of impurity absorption below the band edge
(400–500 nm) for both undoped and iron-doped films.
All undoped samples (also Zn-doped samples)—11 of them altogether—exhibited a
straightforward linear negative susceptibility (figure 2(a)), due to the diamagnetism of the
substrate, χ = −4.8 × 10−9 m3 kg−1 . We found no trace of the ferromagnetic component that
has been reported for undoped anatase films deposited on LaAlO3 [26, 27].
Two-thirds of the films doped with 57 Fe or natural Fe showed a ferromagnetic signal
superposed on the diamagnetic background. Data shown in figure 2(b) are corrected for the
high-field diamagnetism of the substrate and any paramagnetism of the sample. Saturation
moments are in the range 2–7 × 10−8 A m2 or 90–315 µB nm−2 of substrate area. It can be seen
that several of them have moments in excess of 2.2 µB per iron, the value for iron metal; for

example a moment as high as 6.9 µB per iron atom was found in the as-prepared oxidized 1%
film made with 57 Fe.
In order to determine the magnetic state of the iron dopant, Mössbauer spectra were
collected using a conversion electron detector. The mean escape depth of the 7.3 keV conversion
electrons in TiO2 is calculated to be about 140 nm [39], so they effectively probe the entire
depth of the films. The whole of the 5 × 5 mm2 is irradiated with γ -rays. The data with leastsquares fits to the hyperfine parameters are shown in figure 3, and the fit parameters are listed in
table 1. It is evident from these data that all the iron is paramagnetic in the 1% or 3% oxidized
films and most of it is in the Fe2+ or Fe3+ state, respectively. The isomer shift and quadrupole
splitting are in the range for iron ions in octahedral oxygen coordination, and correspond fairly
well to those reported for Fe-doped TiO2 prepared by ball milling [40, 41]. The spectrum for
ferromagnetic iron metal, as shown in figure 3(d), is quite distinctive, and unlike those of
haematite or magnetite. A second phase (haematite) appears at 5% Fe, but not at 1% or 3%.
We find no evidence for magnetite in any of the samples, and even if it were present, it can
explain at most a moment of 1.33 µB per iron. We measure up to 6.9 µB . Even allowing for
differences in recoiless fraction and conversion efficiency, we are confident that at most 10% of
the iron in the 1% and 3% oxidized films could be present as metal. This means a moment of
0.2 µB per iron at most, which is very far from the measured values.
Further evidence that the iron remains magnetically disordered is provided by the highfield susceptibility, figure 2(d), which exhibits Curie law behaviour consistent with the iron
content of the film. Similar conclusions on the state of iron in TiO2 films produced in high or
low oxygen pressure were recently reached by Rykov et al [17]. Evidence is accumulating that
the 3d dopant in other ferromagnetic films, such as Co-doped ZnO, is not magnetically ordered
either [42, 43] .
Nevertheless, the films of figure 3 exhibit ferromagnetic magnetization curves. Although
the reduced magnetization curves measured between 4 and 300 K [figure 2(e)] can be very

with y = αµ0 H , where α = 2.8 is a constant, the specimens are definitely not superpara
magnetic. For a superparamagnet, α must vary as 1/T , but we find it is actually independent of
temperature.
We now address the origin of the magnetism. Contamination is ruled out because undoped
films prepared in the same chamber and handled in the same way as the doped films exhibit no
moment. (Our detection limit for magnetic moment is better than 10−9 A m2 .) Of the 16 irondoped films prepared in oxidizing or reducing conditions that showed ferromagnetism, for only
one, a reduced film with 3% iron that differed from all the others in that it exhibited temperaturedependent hysteresis, could the moment be quantitatively explained by an α-Fe impurity. Four
of the iron-doped films, all with x 1%, were non-magnetic.
Since the magnetic moments of the dopant iron ions are not magnetically ordered, they
cannot be the direct source of the ferromagnetism; we need another explanation. The clue,
highlighted by the 1% oxidized film, is the mixed valence state of the iron. The example of
ilmenite, FeTiO3 , suggests that no reduction of Ti 4+ is to be expected in an oxide in the presence

of Fe2+ . The effect of replacing Ti4+ by Fe2+ in the rutile lattice is the creation of electronic or
structural defects. For example, the substitution
Ti4+ + 2O2− → Fe2+ + 2O−

(2)

creates two ligand holes in the p-shells of oxygen anions close to the iron cation. These holes
will be strongly correlated, but delocalized over the first or more distant coordination spheres.

Their spins will tend to couple ferromagnetically. Any orbital moments on the O− anions should
couple parallel to the spin, according to Hund’s third rule, but the spin–orbit coupling for oxygen
is very weak. The orbital moment should be quenched by the crystal field, but in any case, the
greatest moment achievable for the 2 P3/2 state with g = 4/3 is 2 µB . The fact that we observe
much larger moments in some samples suggests a role for the oxygen vacancies that have been
reported in Fe-doped TiO2 [29, 44] or other defects in quantities that significantly exceed the
number of iron ions. A suggestion by Gallego et al [45] that magnetism in oxide films is due
to oxygen holes associated with the surface atoms leads to a moment of 54 µB nm−2 in TiO2 ,
assuming 1 µB per oxygen and taking both surface and interface oxygen into account. This is
insufficient to explain the moments observed in the 1% samples. The defects would have to
extend beyond a single surface layer. Another suggestion has been a giant paramagnetic orbital
moment associated with surface currents [46, 47], although such screening currents are usually
diamagnetic.
4. An explanation: charge transfer ferromagnetism

In formulating a new model for the magnetism of the doped oxides and other materials that
unexpectedly turn out to be magnetic, we take a cue from the mixed valence of the iron dopant
in the TiO2 films. Ions coexisting in two different 3d configurations constitute a charge reservoir,
from which electrons may be easily transferred to or from states associated with defects in the
lattice. The mechanism for magnetic order, which we call charge transfer ferromagnetism, has
three main components:
(i) a defect-based band with a high density of states in the vicinity of the Fermi level,
(ii) a charge reservoir to or from which electrons can be easily transferred and
(iii) an effective exchange integral I associated with the defect states.
The defect band is closely analogous to the impurity band in semiconductors. Provided the
effective Stoner integral I is large enough, the energy gain from exchange splitting the defect
band can compensate not only the kinetic energy cost of splitting of the band, as in the
standard Stoner model, but also the energy cost of transferring the electrons from the charge
reservoir [37]. A new sort of ferromagnetism results. Unlike a classical Stoner ferromagnet,
where the magnetization is uniform and simply determined by the density of states at the Fermi
level N(E F ) in the unsplit band, provided the Stoner criterion
IN (E F ) > 1

(3)

is satisfied, a charge transfer ferromagnet is not uniformly magnetized. Only the regions
containing the defects become ferromagnetic. Furthermore, the relevant density of states is not
necessarily that at the Fermi level in the unsplit defect band. It would be a fluke for the Fermi
level to fall near the maximum of the density of states. A high density of states above or just
below the Fermi level will suffice, in conjunction with the charge reservoir.
Some possible distributions of defects are illustrated in figure 4. The defects might be
distributed uniformly throughout the material (figure 4(a)), or they may aggregate for example
via spinodal decomposition (figure 4(b)). They could be associated with grain boundaries
(figure 4(d)), with the surface or interface of a thin film (figure 4(c)), or with the surface of
a nanoparticle. In this way, only a small fraction of the total volume of the sample need be

involved. Recent compilations of data on undoped and Mn-doped ZnO by Straumal et al show
that the magnetization correlates with volume occupied by grain boundaries [48].
The physical mechanism is illustrated in figure 5. Electrons are transferred from the charge
reservoir to the defect band, or vice versa, which has the effect of increasing N(E F ) in the defect
band to the point where the Stoner criterion (3) is satisfied. The shaded regions in figure 4 then
become ferromagnetically ordered.
In order to explore the model of charge transfer ferromagnetism quantitatively, we consider
the expression for the total electronic energy, based on three parameters I/W , U/W and Ntot/W .
I is the Stoner integral in the defect band, W is the defect bandwidth, Ntot is the total number of
electrons (including the band and the reservoir) and U characterizes the charge reservoir. Here U
is taken to be the on-site Coulomb energy for transforming a dopant cation from Mn+ to M(n−1)+
(i.e. converting Fe3+ to Fe2+ ). For computational convenience, and to illustrate the richness of
the model, we choose a two-peaked defect density of states N(E) for one spin state
N (E) = (15/4)[8(E − W )2 /W 3 ][1 − 4[(E − W )2 /W 2 ]

Any one- or many-humped density of states with at least one pronounced maximum will give
similar results. Another example would be N (E) = (2/W ) sin2 (2π E/W ) for 0 E W .

term and the charge transfer energy:

where 2ε is the splitting of the defect band, n ↑,↓ = 0 0 N (E ) dE and n 0 is a constant that
reflects the 3d occupancy, 0 n 0 2. The problem is treated within the canonical ensemble
with the Landau potential equal to = E tot –T S − µNtot . Here S is the entropy and µ is the
chemical potential of the system (common to both the defect band and the charge reservoir). As
a simplification the potential is minimized in the limit T = 0 K, and the resulting system of
two nonlinear integral equations is solved numerically for ε and µ. The resulting solutions may
not be unique, because the numerical solutions may depend on the initial guesses for ε and µ.
However, the two-dimensional initial parameter space is sampled with a large number of points,
and the solution (the pair ε, µ with the smallest free energy E tot ) is selected from among all
resulting solutions. The resulting values of ε and µ are then used to evaluate various system
parameters for particular choices of U, Ntot , I and n 0 . The actual bandwidth W is not important
as all the system parameters are normalized by it.
Figure 6 is an example of a phase diagram, calculated for fixed values of I /W = 1
and n 0 /W = 0.4, which illustrates the region of stability where spontaneous charge transfer
ferromagnetism occurs. It is favoured for intermediate values of U/W and Ntot /W and large
values of the Stoner integral I. A number of different phases, both metallic and semiconducting,
can be identified. The Stoner integral I fluctuates across the periodic table, but for light elements
such as oxygen it is about 1 eV [49]. A smaller value may be expected for the free-electron
gas. Ferromagnetism of an oxygen-based defect band is expected, particularly in the coloured
regions of figure 6. For example, U should be less than 3 eV, the bandgap in TiO2 , so if
U = 0.5 eV, W must be 1 eV. This is a plausible value.
The double-humped structure in the defect density of states gives rise to the rich phase
diagram shown in the figure. It should be noted that a sequence of alternating magnetic and
non-magnetic phases is predicted with increasing electron occupation of the defect band. There
is some evidence for this in the ZnO : Co system [50].
It may be noted that sequences of phases such as FI/NM/FM are predicted in figure 6 with
increasing electron concentration. This sequence has been observed in Co-doped ZnO [50].
Localized states due to potential fluctuations (Anderson localization) may be expected when
there are few electrons in the impurity band. The charge transfer ferromagnetism model is
not limited to dilute magnetic oxides. It can apply to d0 ferromagnets as well, provided there
is the requisite charge reservoir. Possible examples are gold nanoparticles [4], germanium
nanocaps [5] and graphite [6], mentioned in the introduction, as well as oxide films such as
HfO2 containing cations with a high charge state [24], defective hexaborides [25], oxygenirradiated TiO2 crystals [29], etc. A characteristic of the ferromagnetism in all these systems is
that it is a high-temperature phenomenon, which is practically anhysteretic. Both these features
flow naturally from the model.
Were it not for spin wave excitations, Stoner ferromagnetism would lead to a Curie
temperature of order the band splitting, which can be a fraction of an electron volt, or thousands
of kelvins. The magnetism of a spin-split impurity band, without the charge reservoir, has

recently been investigated by Edwards and Katsnelson [51] in the context of d0 ferromagnetism
in CaB6 . They find that the spin wave stiffness D for a half-metallic impurity band can be of
order (1/12)R 2 Wv , where R is the nearest-neighbour distance and Wv is the valence bandwidth.
In TiO2 , the width of the 2p band is 10 eV and R ∼ 2 nm; D is therefore 3.3 eV nm2 , which
is much greater than that of cobalt (5 meV nm2 ). The spin wave excitations are therefore
suppressed. High-temperature ferromagnetism is therefore expected in the half metallic region
of the phase diagram of figure 6. An experimental problem with measuring high Curie
temperatures in these systems is that the defects are not in thermodynamic equilibrium, and
their concentration evolves irreversibly on heating.
The screening of the on-site Coulomb interaction that determines the value of I increases
with decreasing bandwidth, but the relevant bandwidth is not W but the width of the 2p(O) band
from which the defect band is derived [51]. Thus, a value of I ∼ 1 eV is plausible.
A last point to emphasize here is that the moment is not limited by the magnitude of the
charge transfer. It reflects the occupancy of the defect band, which becomes split as electrons
are transferred to or from the charge reservoir. The moment may well exceed the number of
transferred electrons. The charge reservoir just serves to tip the energy balance of the defect
band in favour of Stoner splitting.
Finally, we consider the magnetization process of the sparse Stoner ferromagnet.
Magnetocrystalline anisotropy is expected to be negligibly small in the materials we are
considering, for two reasons: (i) the unpaired spins are mostly associated with the ligand, oxygen
or boron, where the spin–orbit coupling is small, or with electrons trapped at oxygen vacancies
(F-centres) or grain boundaries where it is absent and (ii) if there is a local direction for the
crystal field determined by the local symmetry created by the defects, this direction will vary
from site to site, and the anisotropy averages to zero provided it is small to begin with [52]. The
resulting coercivity is negligibly small.
The micromagnetic state in these materials will therefore be governed by magnetic dipole
interactions, which depend on the shape of the percolating magnetic regions where the unpaired
spins are to be found. The ground state will not be strictly ferromagnetic because the local
ferromagnetic axis wanders over a macroscopic sample in response to the competition between
the local dipole field and the exchange stiffness. There is no tendency to form collinear
ferromagnetic domains separated by domain walls when the anisotropy is negligible. For
example, if the ferromagnetic regions with the spin-polarized electrons are the grain boundaries
as suggested in figure 4(d), the magnetization will tend to lie in the plane of the grain boundary,
provided the grain size is greater than the exchange length. The exchange length for Ni, for
example, is 5.1 nm [53]. The magnetization process involves straightening out the ferromagnetic
order, which means overcoming the local dipole fields. This process will scale with the
saturation magnetization, which is practically independent of temperature well below the Curie
temperature. Any residual coercivity due to the dipole interactions will also be temperatureindependent, as seen in figure 2(e)). A simple calculation for macrospins subject to a local dipole
field Ms with random direction gives the fit to the magnetization curve shown in figure 2(e). The
approach to saturation is determined by the value of the magnetization Ms of the ferromagnetic
regions. It may be fitted to within 2–3% by a simple tanh function
M/M0 = tanh(H/H0 ),

(6)

with H0 = 0.16Ms . The average value of H0 for our TiO2 samples is 125 kA m−1 , and the
average magnetization of the thin films M0 is 10 kA m−1 (figure 2(f)). It follows that the average

12
ferromagnetic volume is just 1.3%. An extensive data mining exercise on more than 200 samples
of dilute magnetic oxide thin films and ceramic nanoparticles shows that only 1–5% of the
volume of the films and 1–10 ppm of the volume of the particles are magnetically ordered.
5. Conclusions

Based on our study of the magnetism of Fe-doped TiO2 , and recent results by others on related
materials [29, 44, 48], we have proposed a new theory for the origin of ferromagnetic-like
behaviour of thin films of dilute magnetic oxides and other d0 materials where there is no trivial
explanation in terms of clusters of a ferromagnetic impurity phase. Unlike our earlier impurity
band model with ordered 3d local moments and effective Heisenberg exchange within magnetic
polarons [21], the 3d dopant cations do not contribute directly to the magnetism in the present
model. Here, Stoner-type ferromagnetism is associated with electrons in percolating defect
structures such as grain boundaries, where they form a spin-polarized quasi-two-dimensional
electron gas, which eludes detection by techniques such as small-angle neutron scattering or
XMCD on the dopant or oxygen sites [43, 44]. The ferromagnetic volume where the defects
are located is remarkable small, ≈1% of the film volume. Charge transfer to or from a
charge reservoir into a narrow, defect-related band can give rise to the inhomogeneous Stonertype wandering axis ferromagnetism that reproduces the unusual magnetic properties of these
systems—high Curie temperature, anhysteretic temperature-independent magnetization curves,
a metallic or insulating ferromagnetic-like ground state and a moment that may exceed that of
the dopant cations. All the useful magnetic effects related to spin–orbit coupling are expected
to be weak, but the spin polarization of metallic and half-metallic charge transfer ferromagnets
may provide some opportunities for applications, particularly if the ferromagnetic axis can be
discouraged from wandering by ordering the defects in such a way as to eliminate the random
character of the dipole fields. The challenge is now to control the defects so as to deliver the
sparse high-temperature ferromagnetism to where it may be useful.
