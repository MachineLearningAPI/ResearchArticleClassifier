Abstract—In order to prevent interference problem due to existing
nearby communication systems within the UWB operating frequency,
a compact triple band-notch UWB antenna is presented in this communication. This antenna, designed for the rejection of interference
with Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX), lower
and upper wireless local area networks (WLANs) covering 3.3–3.6 GHz,
5.15–5.35 GHz and 5.725–5.825 GHz, provides three notched bands by only
one structure with simple design. Based on simulation and measurement,
it shows that the proposed antenna can guarantee a wide bandwidth from
3.03 to 11.4 GHz with triple unwanted band-notches successfully.
Index Terms—Complementary co-directional SRR, triple notched
bands, UWB antenna.

I. INTRODUCTION
UWB technology has gained a lot of popularity among researchers
and wireless industries after the FCC permitted its civil application within the frequency band from 3.1 to 10.6 GHz [1]. With its
rapid growth, the ever developing UWB systems raise their demand
for compact and low-cost antennas with omnidirectional radiation
patterns [2]–[6]. Given the challenges encountered in the UWB
antenna design, such as the system interferences, it necessitates the
rejection of interference with some narrow bands for UWB applications in other communication systems, for example, the existing
WiMAX and WLAN covering the 3.3–3.6 GHz, 5.15–5.35 GHz and
5.725–5.825 GHz [7].
Most examples of compact UWB antennas with band notched
characteristic to minimize potential interference have been reported
recently. Generally, the existing techniques in extensive use can be
classified into the following two categories: One method focuses
on loading diverse parasitic elements on the antennas, such as strip
near patch [8], split ring resonators (SRRs) or stepped impedance
resonators (SIRs) near feed line [9], [10] and ring-shaped patch
near ground [11]. The other effective method is embedding various
slots, such as arc-shaped slot [12], U-shaped slot [13], square-shaped
slot [14], pi-shaped slot [15], H-shaped slot [16], fractal slot [17]
and complementary edge-coupled SRR- shaped slot [18]. However,
these methods unavoidably exhibit some inherent defects in practical
applications. The designs for frequency band rejection function bring

occupation of too large space on the antenna as well as strong coupling
between band-notch structures. Consequently, most reported antennas
can only perform one notched band and fail to meet the requirement
of avoiding multiple interferences caused by the coexisting systems.
Indeed, scarce dual or triple band-notch antennas can be realized only
by loading the rejection function designs of different types, different
numbers at different spaces. Therefore, to implement those approaches
will require too much space and accordingly result in complicated
design. Moreover, the strength and width of each notched band, not
being suitable for the rejection of bands for other communication
systems, exhibit poor performance. As a result, the design of compact
antennas with multiple suitable band-notches has become an imperative research area for both the academia and the industry.
Featuring of the multi-frequency signal rejection characteristic,
complementary co-directional SRR is promising for UWB antennas
to ensure multiple notched bands. With its help in this communication, single, dual and triple notched bands can be easily achieved at
such a compact antenna respectively. Especially, the proposed triple
band-notch design could provide three suitable notched bands in small
enough size. Based on the analysis of radiation, waveform distortion
and transmission performance, the proposed antennas demonstrate
to be suitable for UWB applications with good rejection of other
communication systems interference.

A. Different Types of SRR
When time-harmonic external or local magnetic field is applied
along the x- axis, it is not difficult to see how the induced current
distribution on the electrically small SRR in Fig. 1(a) [19], [20]. The
ring, behaving as a circuit driven by an external electromotive force,
shows corresponding magnetic resonance and exhibits a band gap
above magnetic resonance. According to Babinet’s principle [21],
when the time-harmonic external or local electric field is applied along
the x- axis, complementary SRR could show resonant behavior of the
effective permittivity and restrain signal propagation in a narrow band
in the vicinity of the resonant frequency. Two types of double-SRR
structure are further demonstrated in Figs. 1(b) and 1(c). Similarly,
when magnetic field is applied, the SRRs could exhibit corresponding
magnetic resonance [19]. In Fig. 1(b) of the traditional edge-coupled
SRR, its only one distinct fundamental resonance frequency can be
determined by capacitance between the rings due to their different
induced charge distributions [20]. In contrast, when the inner ring

is placed along the same direction as the outer ring in Fig. 1(c), the
capacitance coupling between the rings decreases drastically for their
similar induced charge distributions. Thus, the co-directional SRR
can exhibit dual distinct fundamental magnetic resonance frequencies
for each ring. Analogously, these two corresponding complementary
double-SRR structures of Figs. 1(b) and 1(c), out of Babinet’s principle [21], could gain electric resonant behaviors and restrain signal
propagation. Verified by our simulation study, the complementary
edge-coupled SRR could provide only one distinct band gap, while the
complementary co-directional SRR, with dual distinct fundamental
electric resonance frequencies for dual frequency rejection bands, is
of our interest.
B. Compact Planar Antenna Design
Based on the UWB antenna techniques in literatures [2], [8] and [22],
a compact planar UWB antenna is presented in Fig. 2(a). In this design,
a substrate (FR4) with the permittivity constant "r = 4:4 of the height
1.5 mm is selected and a 50 
- SMA is connected to the end of the
feeding strip and the edge of the ground plane. One measurement of
this antenna is carried out with AV3618 Vector Network Analyzer. As
shown in Fig. 2(b), the measured results indicate a wide bandwidth
3.05–11.03 GHz with VSWR < 2. This result is in agreement with
the simulation (carried out by HFSS [23]) except for a slight deviation
at higher frequencies, which can be ignored [2], [20] since the antenna
is for use in the 3.1–10.6 GHz band.
C. Compact Antenna With Single Band-Notch
According to the small size of complementary single SRR and its
strong signal rejection performance (aforementioned in Section II-A),
it is proposed to etch at the patch of the compact UWB antenna to

achieve a strong notched band in the operation frequency region in
Fig. 3(a). The complementary SRR is arranged in the middle of the
patch close to the feeding strip with the gap opposite to the z -axis.
As our simulation finds, when the complementary SRR gets closer to
the feeding strip, its peak rejection goes higher and rejection band goes
wider. Hence, by adjusting the dimensions of complementary SRR, the
desired single notched band can be easily achieved.Fig. 3(b) shows the
simulated and measured VSWRs versus frequency of the antenna. This
UWB antenna could provide sufficiently wide impedance bandwidth
(VSWR < 2) of 3.02–12 GHz and even more at higher frequency and
show effective rejection frequency band with high peak rejection centered around 5.25 GHz.
Based on above analysis of the resonance mechanism and our parametric study on the complementary single SRR, the notched frequency
can be empirically approximated by

(1)

where c is the speed of light and "eff  ("r )=2 the approximated
effective dielectric constant; Linner and Louter are the lengths of inner
edge and outer edge of complementary SRR, respectively.
D. Compact Antenna With Dual Band-Notches
As aforementioned in Section II-A, the complementary co-directional SRR can show distinct double band gaps due to the weaker mutual coupling between inner and outer rings even the two band gaps are
adjacent. Thus, complementary co-directional SRR is selected to obtain adjacent dual notched bands for lower WLAN and upper WLAN
here. Parameters of two rings are all designed based on (1). Fig. 4(a)
presents the sketch of the dual band-notch UWB antenna. It is noted
that the centers of the inner ring and outer ring are not at the same position (the reason will be analyzed in next paragraph). Fig. 4(b) shows its
measured and simulated VSWRs versus frequency. The antenna could

provide sufficiently wide impedance bandwidth (VSWR < 2) covering 3.08–12 GHz or more with the dual notched bands. Measured
dual notched bands are 4.85-5.35 GHz and 5.65–6.08 GHz (where
VSWR > 2) respectively, covering lower WLAN and upper WLAN
successfully. Therefore, by loading complementary co-directional SRR
with different centers, the SRR can provide good dual band-notch performance. Owning to its dual band-notch structure, the complementary co-directional SRR can reduce the design space to achieve dual
notched bands in comparison with the complementary edge-coupled
SRR [24], [25].
Furthermore, changing the relative position of complementary SRRs
is an effective method to adjust each peak rejection and the rejection
bandwidth. In Fig. 4(c), the relative positions of the inner and outer
complementary rings are discussed. When the inner ring gets close to
the feeding strip, its peak rejection goes higher and rejection band goes
wider. Meanwhile, for lower notched band, the peak rejection goes
lower and rejection band goes narrower. It can be seen from this phenomenon that, when their gaps get closer, the influence on reciprocal
resonance strengths becomes more notable.

III. COMPACT UWB ANTENNA WITH TRIPLE BAND-NOTCHES
As aforementioned in Section I, the UWB antennas with triple band
notches are already presented in [9], [10], [16] and [25]. However,
each band-notch structure placed at different positions, takes too much
space. Here, a novel structure with three complementary co-directional
SRRs is proposed, placing at the superposition to greatly save the space.
Considering the weak coupling between the rings in complementary
co-directional SRR and the strong notched bands, we further add another complementary ring and investigate a triple band-notch UWB antenna, shown in Fig. 5(a).
The triple band-notch UWB antenna is fabricated and measured.
Fig. 5(b) exhibits the measured and simulated VSWRs versus frequency of the triple band-notch antenna. The proposed antenna could
provide sufficiently wide impedance bandwidth covering 3.02–11.1
GHz with the triple notched bands, which operate centered around 3.4
GHz, 5.25 GHz, and 5.78 GHz, respectively.
Fig. 6 shows the current distributions at three center notched bands.
The dimensions of three complementary SRRs [determined by (1)] are
corresponding to three notched bands. When the antenna is working
at the center of lower notched band near 3.4 GHz, the outer complementary SRR behaves as a separator in Fig. 6(a), which almost has
no relation to the other band-notches. Similarly, the middle complementary SRR operates as a second separator for the center of middle
notched band near 5.25 GHz in Fig. 6(b). From Fig. 6(c), the upper
notched band near 5.78 GHz is ensured by the inner complementary
SRR. Additionally, as a certain current crowded on the ground plane

near the feed line would affect the antenna performance, we take simulation and find that the dimension of ground plane, especially L3 , has
a significant effect on the triple band-notches performance, as well as
impedance bandwidth.
The boresight gains at +x direction versus frequency of the reference antenna (without band-notch) and triple band-notch UWB antenna
are measured and displayed in Fig. 7(a). It is observed that the average
gain of the reference antenna is about 2.9–5.5 dBi over the entire operating band, exhibiting general flat gain performance [26]. When the
triple band notches are loaded, the sharp frequency notched characteristic is obtained due to the frequency notched function. The gain reduction is about 13.6 dB at 3.4 GHz, 7.9 dB at 5.25 GHz and 7.6 dB at
5.78 GHz, respectively.
The measured far-field radiation patterns for the triple band-notch
UWB antenna at 3 GHz, 6.5 GHz, and 9 GHz are plotted in Figs. 7(b)

and 7(c). It is seen that the radiation patterns in xy -cut plane (H - plane)
are almost omnidirectional and the radiation patterns in xy -cut plane
(E -plane) are monopole alike. Clearly, the triple notch UWB antenna
has a good radiation performance. When it operates at 3.4 GHz, 5.25
GHz and 5.78 GHz, the gains in the two planes drop significantly, in
accordance with the results in Fig. 7(a). It is noted that the radiation pattern at each notched band in H -plane is not omnidirectional because of
the dramatically increasing current distribution near three band notches
[27], shown in Fig. 6.
To examine the antenna performance in time domain, the phases of
transmission response and waveform distortion in the operating frequency region are discussed. Here, a time-domain finite integration
technique (CST Microwave Studio) [28] is used to carry out the following simulations. A pair of identical antennas is placed face to face
with a distance 0.5 m [9], [26]. It can be seen that the phase response
from the original antenna is generally linear in Fig. 8(a). By contrast,
the phase response for triple band-notch antenna provided in Fig. 8(b),
though witnessing few ripples at notched bands, is also linear.
And then, the normalized source spectrum and the pulses are portrayed in Fig. 9(a) and (b) respectively. The frequency spectrum of
modulated Gaussian pulse is chosen corresponding to 3–11 GHz. For
original antenna pair, the received signal experiences slight distortion
shown in Fig. 9(c), which can be explained by the linear phase response
shown in Fig. 8(a) [26]. The received pulse [in Fig. 9(c)] is then transformed into frequency spectrum, as shown in Fig. 9(d). Clearly, we can
observe that the operating frequency spectrum also covers UWB region
well. Likewise, the similar work is taken to evaluate the triple bandnotch antenna performance. Compared with original antenna pair, the
triple band-notch antenna pair experiences a little spread in the waveform, indicating that part of the source pulse can not be received as
shown in Fig. 9(e) [26]. And in Fig. 9(f), three narrow frequency spectrum bands [corresponding to the results in Figs. 7(a) and 8(b)] takes
sharply a great drop in the signal amplitude, reflecting to be hardly
transmitted and received by the band-notch antennas. This result in
Fig. 9(f) validates that the source pulse, locating within the notched
bandwidth, is accurately filtered by the band-notch structure of antenna.
Therefore, Fig. 9 illustrates that, the proposed band-notch antenna can
restrain the signal transmission within narrow band-notch spectrums
effectively and maintain the integrity of signal transmission outside.
Furthermore, the antenna transfer functions (jS21 j) between pairs
of identical antennas are also measured and discussed. In the measurement, the antenna pair, also aligned face to face with a distance 0.5
m, is connected to the two ports of the vector network analyzer indoor
[10], [27]. In Fig. 10, the original antenna pair exhibits approximately
flat magnitude (040 to 033 dB) of transfer gain in UWB frequency
region. For the triple band-notch antenna pair, the transfer gain remains
flat on the whole, except in the notched bands centered around 3.4 GHz,
5.25 GHz, 5.78 GHz, where the magnitudes reduce dramatically by

18–25 dB. Accordingly, the experiment shows agreement with the results in Figs. 7(a) and 9, which further validates its excellent multiple
band-notches in UWB communications.
IV. CONCLUSION
We proposed a compact antenna for the rejection of interference with
WiMAX and WLAN. Analysis results show that the proposed antenna
guarantees a bandwidth wider than the region 3.1–10.6 GHz with unwanted band-notches and keep omnidirectional radiation performance

successfully. The performances of the proposed antenna prove it is suitable for UWB applications.
