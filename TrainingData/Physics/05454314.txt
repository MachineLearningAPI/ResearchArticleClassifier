Planar Monopole With a Coupling Feed and an Inductive
Shorting Strip for LTE/GSM/UMTS Operation in the
Mobile Phone
Cheng-Tse Lee and Kin-Lu Wong

Abstract—A planar monopole having a small size yet providing two
wide bands for covering the eight-band LTE/GSM/UMTS operation in
the mobile phone is presented. The small-size yet wideband operation is
achieved by exciting the antenna’s wide radiating plate using a coupling
feed and short-circuiting it to the system ground plane of the mobile
phone through a long meandered strip as an inductive shorting strip.
The coupling feed leads to a wide operating band to cover the frequency
range of 1710–2690 MHz for the GSM1800/1900/UMTS/LTE2300/2500
operation. The inductive shorting strip results in the generation of a wide
operating band to cover the frequency range of 698–960 MHz for the
LTE700/GSM850/900 operation. The planar monopole can be directly
printed on the no-ground portion of the system circuit board of the mobile
phone and is promising to be integrated with a practical loudspeaker. The
antenna’s radiating plate can also be folded into a thin structure (3 mm
only) to occupy a small volume of 3 6 40 mm (0.72 cm ) for the
eight-band LTE/GSM/UMTS operation; in this case, including the 8-mm
feed gap, the antenna shows a low profile of 14 mm to the ground plane of
the mobile phone. The proposed antenna, including its planar and folded
structures, are suitable for slim mobile phone applications.

I. INTRODUCTION
Planar monopoles with a wide radiating plate are simple in configuration and have been shown to generate wideband operation to
cover the multiband WWAN (wireless wide area network) communications [1], [2] for mobile phone applications. However, in order to
cover the GSM operation in the 900-MHz band, the wide radiating
plate in the planar monopole usually occupies a large volume and is
required to be in the folded structure to achieve a reduced size for internal mobile phone antenna applications. In the reported designs, this
kind of planar monopole for covering the 900-MHz band operation requires the use of a folded radiating plate of size 10 2 10 2 70 mm3
(7.0 cm3 ) [1] or 10 2 15 2 35 mm3 (5.25 cm3 ) [2]. In addition to the
large volume occupied, the thickness of the folded radiating plate is as
large as 10 mm, which is not promising for applications in the modern
slim mobile phone which generally requires its internal antenna to have
a thin profile of 4 mm or less [3]–[8]. When a planar radiating plate is
used, it is reported that a planar monopole with a size of 30 2 50 mm2
(1500 mm2 ) can have a wide operating band of 870–2450 MHz for the
mobile phone [9]. However, the large size of 1500 mm2 will greatly
limit its applications in the internal mobile phone antennas.
In this communication, we present a novel planar monopole design
having a small size yet capable of generating two wide operating
bands to cover the eight-band LTE/GSM/UMTS operation in the
mobile phone, which includes the LTE700 (698–787 MHz), GSM850

(824–894 MHz), GSM900 (880–960 MHz), GSM1800 (1710–1880
MHz), GSM1900 (1850–1990 MHz), UMTS (1920–2170 MHz),
LTE2300 (2305–2400 MHz) and LTE2500 (2500–2690 MHz) bands.
Notice that the LTE (long term evolution) operation [10] can provide better mobile broadband and multimedia services than the
existing GSM and UMTS mobile networks [11] and is expected
to become attractive for the mobile users. The lower band of the
proposed planar monopole can have a large bandwidth to cover the
frequency range of 698–960 MHz for the LTE700/GSM850/900
operation. The upper band can have an even larger bandwidth
(>1 GHz) to cover the frequency range of 1710–2690 MHz for
the GSM1800/1900/UMTS/LTE2300/2500 operation. The proposed
planar monopole is suitable to be directly printed on the no-ground
portion of the system circuit board of the mobile phone, making it
easy to fabricate at low cost. The size of the wide radiating plate
of the planar monopole is 12 2 40 mm2 or 480 mm2 only, which is
much smaller than those in [1], [2] (both at least 1400 mm2 ). When
including the 8-mm feed gap, the no-ground portion required in the
proposed design is 20 2 40 mm2 (800 mm2 ), which is much less
than that (1500 mm2 ) in [9]. The antenna can also be integrated with
a nearby loudspeaker in a compact configuration. To achieve small
size yet wideband operation, the proposed planar monopole is excited
using a coupling feed and short-circuited to the system ground plane
of the mobile phone through a long meandered strip as an inductive
shorting strip. Detailed effects of the coupling feed and the inductive
shorting strip are discussed in the communication.
Further, the radiating plate of the proposed antenna can be folded
into a thin structure (3 mm only) to occupy a small volume of
3 2 6 2 40 mm3 (0.72 cm3 only) for the eight-band LTE/GSM/UMTS
operation. The 3 mm in thickness is promising for applications in the
modern slim mobile phone. In this case, by including the 8-mm feed
gap between the radiating plate and the system ground plane of the
mobile phone, the antenna also shows a low profile of 14 mm to the
top edge of the ground plane. Details of the proposed antenna are
presented.
II. PROPOSED ANTENNA
Fig. 1(a) shows the geometry of the proposed planar monopole with
a coupling feed and an inductive shorting strip for the eight-band LTE/
GSM/UMTS operation in the mobile phone. Dimensions of the metal
pattern of the antenna are given in Fig. 1(b). A 0.8-mm thick FR4 substrate is used as the system circuit board of the mobile phone. The
1-mm thick plastic casing (relative permittivity 3.0 and conductivity
0.02 S/m) enclosing the circuit board as the casing of a slim mobile
phone has a thin profile of 9.8 mm. On the circuit board there is a
printed system ground plane of size 40 2 100 mm2 and a no-ground
portion of size 40 2 20 mm2 .
The planar monopole is printed on the no-ground portion and comprises a wide radiating plate of size 12 2 40 mm2 flushed to the top
edge of the circuit board. Between the radiating plate and the ground
plane, there is a feed gap of length 8 mm. A simple coupling strip of
length (t) 12.5 mm, which is connected to the 50-
 microstrip feedline printed on the circuit board through a 8-mm long metal strip across
the feed gap, capacitively excites the radiating plate. Across the feed
gap, there is also a long meandered metal strip to short circuit the radiating plate to the ground plane. The meandered metal strip has a length
of about 31 mm and a narrow width of 0.3 mm and behaves like a
simple shorting strip loaded with a chip inductor (see Ref3 in the inset
of Fig. 11; detailed discussion will be given in Section IV). The meandered metal strip is hence considered as an inductive shorting strip
here.

are large effects of the inductive shorting strip on the antenna’s lower
band, the impedance matching for frequencies over the desired upper
band of 1710–2690 MHz is relatively slightly affected. This makes it
easy to fine-tune the desired lower and upper bands for the antenna to
cover the eight-band LTE/GSM/UMTS operation.
The proposed antenna can also be in other possible embodiments
for practical applications. The first one is to use a chip-inductor-loaded
shorting strip replacing the inductive shorting strip and is shown in Ref3
in the inset of Fig. 11. The second one is to have its wide radiating plate
folded into a thin structure (3 mm in thickness) such that the folded
radiating plate occupies a small volume of 3 2 6 2 40 mm3 or 0.72 cm3
only (see Ref4 in the inset of Fig. 12). The third one is to integrate with
a nearby loudspeaker [19]–[21] such that a compact integration of the
proposed antenna in the mobile phone is achieved. For these possible
embodiments, the eight-band LTE/GSM/UMTS operation can also be
obtained. Detailed results will be discussed in Section IV.

The coupling feed applied in this study effectively compensates for
the large inductive reactance over a wide frequency range, especially
over the desired upper band of 1710–2690 MHz. This leads to a very
wide operating band obtained for the antenna’s upper band to cover
the GSM1800/1900/UMTS/LTE2300/LTE2500 operation. This coupling-feed effect is different from that applied for the internal WWAN
antennas for mobile phone or laptop computer applications [12]–[18],
in which the coupling feed mainly leads to enhanced bandwidth for the
antenna’s lower band at about 900 MHz [12]–[16] or causes the excitation of the one-eighth-wavelength resonant mode as the antenna’s
lowest mode for the 900-MHz band operation [17], [18]. The different
coupling-feed effect obtained here is related to the use of the wide radiating plate in the proposed design, which is different from the long,
narrow radiating strips used in [12]–[16]. The coupling-feed effect in
the proposed design is also different from the use of a long (26 mm)
coupling T-strip protruded from the ground plane, which is mainly for
decreasing the lowest resonant frequency of the antenna [9].
By incorporating the use of the inductive shorting strip, a wide operating band to cover the frequency range of 698–960 MHz for the
LTE700/GSM850/900 operation can be generated. Detailed effects of
the inductive shorting strip on the generation of the antenna’s wide
lower band are discussed with the aid of Fig. 3 in Section III. Also note
that without the use of the wide radiating plate, that is, when the width
w of the radiating plate is decreased (the preferred width w is 12 mm in
this design), good impedance matching over the desired wide frequency
range of 698–960 MHz cannot be achieved (see the results shown in
Fig. 5; detailed discussion will be given in Section III). Although there

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Fig. 2 shows the measured and simulated return loss of the proposed
antenna. The measured data agree with the simulated results obtained
using Ansoft simulation software HFSS version 11.2 [22]. With the
3:1 VSWR bandwidth definition, which is widely used as the design
specification of the internal mobile phone antenna for WWAN communications [3]–[5], [9], two wide operating bands are obtained. The
lower band shows a wide bandwidth of 490 MHz (690–1180 MHz),
while the upper band has an even wider bandwidth of 1220 MHz
(1670–2890 MHz). The wide lower and upper bands cover the
LTE700/ GSM850/900 and GSM1800/1900/UMTS/LTE2300/2500
operation, respectively.
Fig. 3 shows the comparison of the simulated return loss for the proposed antenna, the case with a direct feed and a simple shorting strip
(Ref1) and the case with a coupling feed and a simple shorting strip
(Ref2). The corresponding dimensions for the three studied antennas
in the figure are the same. Ref2 applies a coupling feed to replace the
conventional direct feed used in Ref1. From the results of Ref1 and
Ref2, a much wider bandwidth for Ref2 than for Ref1 is seen. The obtained bandwidth for Ref2 reaches about 1.7 GHz, from about 1.1 to
2.8 GHz; while the bandwidth for Ref1 is less than 300 MHz.
From the comparison of Ref2 and proposed antenna in Fig. 3, a wide
lower band centered at about 900 MHz is generated, which is owing to
the use of the inductive shorting strip replacing the simple shorting strip
in Ref2. There are two resonant modes, the first one at about 700 and the
second one at about 1000 MHz, contributed to the obtained wide lower
band. The first one is owing to the presence of the inductive shorting
strip, while the second one is related to the resonant mode at about
1.5 GHz for Ref2. This is mainly because the inductive shorting strip
causes the lengthening of the effective resonant path of the antenna,
which not only generates a new additional resonant mode but also shifts

the 1.5 GHz resonant mode of Ref2 to lower frequencies. It is also
seen that the input impedance for higher frequencies larger than about
1.7 GHz is very slightly varied for Ref2 and proposed antenna. A wide
upper band covering the desired frequency range of 1710–2690 MHz
is thus maintained.
Effects of varying the length t of the coupling strip are also studied.
The simulated return loss for the length t varied from 9.5 to 15.5 mm
is shown in Fig. 4. Small effects on the antenna’s lower band are seen.
The bandwidth of the upper band, however, can be controlled by the
length t. By increasing the length t, the upper band is shifted to lower
frequencies. That is, by selecting a proper length t (12.5 mm in this
study), the upper band can be adjusted to cover the desired frequency
range of 1710–2690 MHz.
The simulated return loss for the width w of the radiating plate varied
from 2 to 12 mm is presented in Fig. 5. Large effects of the width w on
the antenna’s lower band are seen. When the width w decreases, the obtained bandwidth of the antenna’s lower band is quickly decreased and
becomes unable to cover the desired frequency range of 698–960 MHz.
Some effects on the upper band are also seen, which are, however, small
compared to those on the lower band.
The simulated surface current distributions at typical frequencies are
shown in Fig. 6. At 750 and 1000 MHz, relatively strong excited surface
current distributions are seen in the system ground plane, compared to
those at higher frequencies. An additional current null is also seen at

about the center of the system ground plane; this is owing to the shorter
wavelength at higher frequencies. On the other hand, relatively strong
surface current distributions in the radiating plate are seen at 2000 and
2650 MHz than at lower frequencies. These results indicate that the
system ground plane is an important radiating part, especially at lower
frequencies.
Effects of the length of the system ground plane on the antenna performances are studied in Fig. 7. Results of the simulated return loss for
the length L varied from 80 to 100 mm are shown. Large effects on
the obtained 3:1 VSWR bandwidth for the lower band are seen. When
the length L is decreased, the impedance matching for frequencies between the two resonant modes in the lower band is degraded. For the
upper band, however, the effects are relatively small and the obtained
bandwidth is generally about the same.

Fig. 8 plots the measured radiation patterns at 830 and 2200 MHz
(about central frequencies of the desired lower and upper bands).
At 830 MHz, dipole-like radiation patterns with omnidirectional
radiation in the azimuthal plane (x-y plane) are observed. While at
2200 MHz, more variations in the patterns are seen. Also note that
measured radiation patterns at other frequencies in the lower and upper
bands showed similar results as those plotted in Fig. 8. The obtained
radiation patterns also show no special distinctions to those of the
printed internal WWAN mobile phone antennas [16]–[18]. Fig. 9

shows the measured antenna gain and simulated radiation efficiency.
Over the 698–960 MHz band shown in Fig. 9(a), the antenna gain is
about 00:8–0:9 dBi radiation and the radiation efficiency ranges from
about 52% to 78%. Over the 1710–2690 MHz band in Fig. 9(b), the
antenna gain is about 1.9–3.8 dBi, and the radiation efficiency ranges
from about 68% to 92%.
The SAR (specific absorption rate) values of the proposed antenna
are also tested using the simulation software SEMCAD [23]. Since it
is known that this kind of printed antenna with no ground plane on
back is suitable to be placed at the bottom of the mobile phone to obtain decreased SAR values [24], [25], only the proposed antenna at the
bottom of the mobile phone as shown in the simulation model in Fig. 10
is tested. The obtained SAR values are given in the figure, which are all
below the SAR limit of 1.6 W/kg for the 1.0-g head tissue and 2.0 W/kg
for the 10-g head tissue [26]. The results suggest that the proposed antenna is promising for practical mobile phone applications.
IV. OTHER EMBODIMENTS OF THE PROPOSED ANTENNA
The inductive shorting strip in the proposed antenna can be replaced by a simple shorting strip loaded with a chip inductor. Fig. 11
shows the comparison of the simulated return loss for the proposed
antenna and the corresponding antenna with a coupling feed and a
chip-inductor-loaded shorting strip (Ref3). The chip inductor has an
inductance of 8 nH (selected from the aid of Ansoft HFSS simulation)
and is not necessarily to be placed in the middle of the shorting

strip. There are almost no differences in the simulated return loss
for the proposed antenna and Ref3. This also confirms that the long
meandered shorting metal strip can be treated as an inductive shorting
strip.
The antenna structure of Ref4 in the inset of Fig. 12 shows that
the wide radiating plate of the proposed antenna can be in the folded
structure with a thin thickness of 3 mm and a small volume of
3 2 6 2 40 mm3 (0.72 cm3 ). Notice that the total length of the folded
radiating plate of Ref4 is 15 mm, longer than that (12 mm) of the
printed structure shown in Fig. 1. In this case, as shown in Fig. 12, the
obtained return loss of Ref4 is about the same as that of the proposed
antenna. Ref4 also shows a low profile of 14 mm to the system ground
plane of the mobile phone, which is smaller compared to that (20 mm)
of the proposed antenna in Fig. 1.
The proposed antenna can also be in compact integration with a practical loudspeaker [19]–[21]. The measured return loss for the cases
with and without the loudspeaker is about the same (measured data
not shown for brevity), indicating that such a compact integration is
promising for practical applications. Also note that, by using the loudspeaker simulation model in [21], [27], the simulated results indicate
that the radiation efficiency will be decreased by about 5% in the lower
band and about 10% in the upper band, which may be owing to some
lossy materials contained in the loudspeaker.
V. CONCLUSION
A planar monopole with a wide radiating plate excited by a coupling feed and short-circuited by an inductive metal strip has been
shown to achieve small size yet wideband operation for applications
in the mobile phone to cover the eight-band LTE/GSM/UMTS operation. The proposed antenna can be in an all-printing structure or folded
thin structure; both structures can provide two wide operating bands to
cover the desired frequency ranges of 698–960 and 1710–2690 MHz.
The antenna can also be in compact integration with a practical loudspeaker. The obtained results indicate that the proposed antenna is suitable to be applied in the modern slim mobile phone for the eight-band
LTE/GSM/UMTS operation.
