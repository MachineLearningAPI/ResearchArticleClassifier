Abstract. In this addendum to Schwetz et al (2011 New J. Phys. 13 063004),
we consider the recent results from long-baseline νµ → νe searches at the Tokai
to Kamioka (T2K) and Main Injector Neutrino Oscillation Search (MINOS)
experiments and investigate their implications for the mixing angle θ13 and the
leptonic Dirac CP phase δ. By combining the 2.5σ indication for a nonzero value
of θ13 coming from the T2K data with global neutrino oscillation data, we obtain
a significance for θ13 > 0 of about 3σ with best fit points sin2 θ13 = 0.013 (0.016)
for normal (inverted) neutrino mass ordering. These results depend somewhat on
assumptions concerning the analysis of reactor neutrino data.

1. Introduction

Prompted by the recently published indication for electron neutrino appearance by the T2K
experiment [1], we have updated the global neutrino oscillation analysis presented in [2].
The T2K experiment uses a neutrino beam consisting mainly of muon neutrinos, produced at
the J-PARC accelerator facility and observed at a distance of 295 km and an off-axis angle of
2.5◦ by the Super-Kamiokande detector. The present data release corresponds to 1.43 × 1020
protons on target [2]. Six events pass all selection criteria for an electron neutrino event. In
a three-flavor neutrino oscillation scenario with θ13 = 0 the expected number of such events is
1.5 ± 0.3 (syst). Under this hypothesis, the probability of observing six or more candidate events
is 7 × 10−3 , equivalent to a significance of 2.5σ . We investigate the implications of this result
for the mixing angle θ13 and the leptonic Dirac CP phase δ, focusing on long-baseline νµ → νe
appearance data from T2K and MINOS in section 2, whereas the results of a combined analysis
of global neutrino oscillation data are presented in section 3.
2. Long-baseline νµ → νe appearance data from T2K and MINOS

For our re-analysis of T2K, we use the spectral data shown in figure 5 of [2] given as 5 bins
in reconstructed neutrino energy from 0 to 1.25 GeV. Using the neutrino fluxes predicted at
Super-Kamiokande in the absence of oscillations provided in figure 1 of [2], we calculate the
νµ → νe appearance signal by tuning our prediction to the corresponding prediction in figure 5
of [2]. In the fit we include the background distribution shown in that figure with a systematic
normalization uncertainty of 23% and adopt the χ 2 definition based on the Poisson distribution.
The calculation is performed by using the GLoBES simulation software [3]. Latest MINOS
data on the νµ → νe channel have been presented in [4], corresponding to 8.2 × 1020 protons
on target, compared to the 7 × 1020 used in [1]. MINOS finds 62 events with an expectation in
the absence of oscillations of 49.6 ± 7.0(stat) ± 2.7(syst), showing no significant indication for
νµ → νe transitions.
In figure 1, we show the region in the sin2 θ13 − δ plane indicated by T2K data in
comparison to MINOS results. Whereas for T2K we obtain a closed region for sin2 θ13 at
90% CL ( χ 2 = 2.7), for MINOS we found only an upper bound. As is clear from the figure,
T2K and MINOS results are compatible with each other and we show the combined analysis
as shaded regions, where the upper bound is determined by the MINOS constraint while the
lower bound is given by T2K. Best fit values are in the range sin2 θ13 ≈ 0.015–0.023, depending
on the CP phase δ, where the variation is somewhat larger for the inverted mass hierarchy. The
dotted lines in this figure indicate the 90% CL upper bound on sin2 θ13 coming from a combined
analysis of the remaining oscillation data, including global reactor, solar, atmospheric and longbaseline disappearance data.
3. Global analysis

We move now to the combined analysis of the T2K and MINOS νe appearance searches with
global neutrino oscillation data as described and referenced in [1]. For the reactor analysis we
use the ‘recommended’ analysis from [1], which adopts the new reactor neutrino fluxes from [5]
while including short-baseline reactor neutrino experiments with baselines 100 km in the fit.
The results for θ13 are summarized in figure 2. For both neutrino mass hierarchies we found that

χ 2 = 1, 2.71 for T2K and MINOS appearance data
(curves) and their combination (shaded regions). For all other oscillation
parameters we assume best fit values and uncertainties according to table 1, and
we include a 5% uncertainty on the matter density. The left (right) panel is for
normal (inverted) mass hierarchy. The dotted line shows the 90% CL upper limit
on sin2 θ13 from a combined analysis of all other oscillation data. The blue (black)
triangle corresponds to the best fit point of the MINOS (T2K) data analysis, while
the black star denotes the best fit point of the combined MINOS + T2K analysis.

the 2.5σ indication for θ13 > 0 from T2K gets pushed to the 3σ level ( χ 2 = 9) when combined
with the weak hint for a nonzero θ13 obtained from the remaining data [1]; see also [6]. We found
best fit points at
sin2 θ13 = 0.013,

δ = −0.61π

(normal hierarchy),

sin2 θ13 = 0.016,

δ = −0.41π

(inverted hierarchy).

(1)

Due to some complementarity between T2K and MINOS, one obtains, after combining
with the θ13 limit from the rest of the data, a ‘preferred region’ for the CP phase δ at χ 2 = 1,
as seen in figure 2. Obviously this preference for the CP phase is not significant3 . Marginalizing
over the CP phase δ (and all other oscillation parameters) we obtain for the best fit, one-sigma
errors, and the significance for θ13 > 0:
sin2 θ13 = 0.013+0.007
−0.005 ,

χ 2 = 10.1 (3.2σ )

(normal),

sin2 θ13 = 0.016+0.008
−0.006 ,

χ 2 = 10.1 (3.2σ )

(inverted).

(2)

As expected the upper bound on sin2 θ13 is dominated by global data without long-baseline
appearance data, whereas the lower bound comes mainly from T2K.
Let us briefly consider the sensitivity of these results to the assumptions on the analysis
of reactor neutrino data. As discussed in detail in [1], there is a slight tension between reactor
neutrino fluxes obtained in [5] and the results of short-baseline reactor neutrino experiments
with baselines 100 km. The increase of reactor neutrino fluxes compared to previous
calculations in [5] has been confirmed qualitatively by an independent recent calculation [8].

Prospects to constrain δ with the present generation of experiments have been discussed in [7].

combined global data (‘global’). Lower panels: contours of χ 2 = 1, 4, 9 in the

We minimize over all undisplayed oscillation parameters. Left (right) panels are

the best fit point of the LBL app (global) analysis.

To illustrate the impact on θ13 , we show the results for two alternative assumptions for the
reactor analysis. Adopting the fluxes from [5] but omitting reactor experiments with baselines
100 km, we obtain for the best fit, one-sigma errors, and the significance for θ13 > 0:
sin2 θ13 = 0.022 ± 0.008,

χ 2 = 13.5 (3.7σ )

(NH)

sin2 θ13 = 0.026 ± 0.009,

χ 2 = 15.2 (3.9σ )

(IH)

(no SBL react).

(3)

If instead we do include the short-baseline reactor data but leave the overall normalization of
the reactor neutrino flux free, we obtain
sin2 θ13 = 0.011+0.007
−0.004 ,

χ 2 = 7.7 (2.8σ )

(NH)

sin2 θ13 = 0.014+0.007
−0.006 ,

χ 2 = 8.4 (2.9σ )

(IH)

(flux free).

(4)

We see that the precise value of the sin2 θ13 best fit point, as well as the significance for θ13 > 0,
still depend on assumptions on the reactor analysis, as discussed in detail in [1].
To summarize, we display the status for all neutrino oscillation parameters from the
global analysis using the default reactor treatment in table 1. If θ13 is indeed within
the currently indicated range, we may expect a confirmation by future T2K data soon.
Depending on whether its true value is close to the upper of the lower edge of the currently
favored range, an independent confirmation of a nonzero θ13 may be expected from reactor

experiments within a few months to a few years [9]. After establishing the large mixing angleMikheyev–Smirnov–Wolfenstein (LMA-MSW) solution to the solar neutrino problem, the
present 3σ indication for a nonzero θ13 may turn out to be the first sign of the second necessary
ingredient for observable CP violation in neutrino oscillations; see, e.g., [10] for a review.
