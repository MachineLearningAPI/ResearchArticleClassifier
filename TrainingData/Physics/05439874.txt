ADS-Based Guidelines for Thinned Planar Arrays
Giacomo Oliveri, Member, IEEE, Luca Manica, Graduate Student Member, IEEE, and Andrea Massa, Member, IEEE

Abstract—We propose an analytical technique based on almost difference sets (ADSs) for thinning planar arrays with
well controlled sidelobes. The method allows one to synthesize
bidimensional arrangements with peak sidelobe levels (PSLs) predictable and deducible from the knowledge of the array aperture,
the filling factor, and the autocorrelation function of the ADS at
hand. The numerical validation, concerned with both small and
very large apertures, points out that the expected PSL values are
significantly below those of random arrays and comparable with
those from different sets (DSs) although obtainable in a wider
range of configurations.
Index Terms—Almost difference sets, array antennas, planar arrays, sidelobe level control, thinned arrays.

I. INTRODUCTION

A

NTENNA arrays for radar tracking, remote sensing,
biomedical imaging, satellite and ground communications have often to support three-dimensional scanning with
a suitable beampattern shape in the whole angular region [1].
Towards this end, planar arrays have to be used and large apertures are necessary to provide satisfactory angular resolutions
along both azimuth and elevation [1]. On the other hand, the
inter-element spacing should not exceed half-wavelength to
avoid the presence of grating lobes [1]. These requirements
usually result in very inefficient, heavy, and expensive solutions
consisting of planar geometries with several thousands close
elements.
In order to reduce the number of elements while keeping
the radiation properties of the original structures, thinning
techniques have been successfully introduced [2]. Designing
thinned planar arrays is an important research topic since
decades (see [2]–[8] and the references cited therein). As a
matter of fact, a suitable thinning allows one to reduce the
array costs, its weight, and the power consumption. However,
it causes the loss of the control of the peak sidelobe level (PSL)
[6] to be properly counteracted. To this end, several techniques
has been proposed in order to fully exploit the advantages of
thinned arrangements while minimizing their drawbacks. First
attempts have been conceived to require low computational resources (see [9, Table I]), but they have provided no significant

improvements when compared with random placements [2],
[9] extensively employed in practice [2].
More recently, the availability of large computational resources has justified the use of optimization techniques such as
dynamic programming [10], [11], genetic algorithms [5], [7],
[8], [12], simulated annealing [13]–[17], and particle swarm
optimizers [18]. Thinned arrays synthesized with optimization
tools turn out to be very effective [7], [8], [11], [14], even
though it is not possible to a-priori estimate the expected
performances for a given array aperture and thinning factor
[6]. Furthermore, computational and convergence issues make
the application of stochastic optimizers difficult and expensive
when dealing with 1D large apertures [6] and, even more, when
planar arrangements are considered.
In order to overcome such drawbacks, an alternative approach
for thinning large arrays has been introduced (see [4] for the
linear case and [6], [9], [20]–[22] for both linear and planar
cases). Such an approach relies on the exploitation of binary
sequences derived from difference sets (DSs), which exhibit a
two-level autocorrelation function [4], or from DSs extensions
[19]–[21]. Besides their analytic nature and the arising inexpensive generation, DS-based thinned arrays have several interesting properties. They are deterministically designed and
present predictable [6] and low PSLs (3 dB and 1.5 dB below
random arrays for the linear case and the planar one, respectively). However, only a limited number of DS sequences exist
and the whole set of aperture sizes and thinning values [6], [23]
cannot be dealt with.
The problem of obtaining sub-optimal sequences (in terms
of autocorrelation levels) has been recently addressed in information theory and “close” sequences to DSs have been looked
for. Almost difference sets (ADSs) [24]–[26] are a wide class of
binary sequences with three-valued autocorrelations [24]–[26].
They represent the closest sets to DSs [24]–[26] (three-levels vs.
two-levels) and can be defined in a much broader set of aperture
sizes and thinning values with respect to DSs [27]. Furthermore
large repositories of explicit sequences are now available (e.g.,
[28]). They have been determined by numerically implementing
the generating rules coming from the information-theory/combinatorial-mathematics literature (e.g., [26]).
As regards
geometries, the sidelobe characteristics of
ADS-based arrays have been analyzed in [27] and good performances have been predicted and numerically verified dealing
with both small and large apertures. Because of these results,
its deterministic nature, and preliminary examples of planar
arrays based on a subset ADSs with peculiar power patterns
features (see [19]–[21] and the references therein for more
details), an ADS-based technique seems to be a good candidate
for thinning planar arrangements of radiating elements and it

will be presented in this paper. More specifically, the objective
is not to define the “optimal” thinning method, but rather to
provide a simple and reliable technique which guarantees to
the designer predictable performances to be taken into account
during the feasibility study. Towards this end, the PSL behavior
of ADS-based planar arrays will be analytically investigated
and, for the first time to the best of the author’s knowledge,
different bounds will be provided by considering the whole and
in a general fashion the whole class of 2D ADSs. It should be
pointed out that, despite the linear case [27] where the Blahut’s
theorem [27] has been applied, a different mathematical analysis is here necessary. Unlike the mathematical approach in
[27] and [6], the PSL bounds are then derived starting from
an innovative formulation based on the 2D discrete Fourier
transform and related theorems, which allows a compact and
straightforward analytical formulation.
The paper is organized as follows. After a short overview
on ADSs (Section II), a set of suitable bounds of the PSL are
analytically determined in Section III. Section IV provides a
selected set of numerical results aimed at validating the obtained PSL estimators as well as comparing the ADS performances with both random techniques and state-of-the-art optimization approaches. The exploitation of directive elements
is also considered in order to point out the flexibility of the
ADS thinning theory. Finally, some conclusions are drawn
(Section V).

Concerning the ADS generation, several theorems have
already been proposed in information theory and combinatorial mathematics (e.g., see [26] and references therein).
Analogously, the explicit forms of many others ADSs have
been determined and they are now available in [28]. Furthermore, suitable techniques/theorems for completing the
whole set of theoretically admissible ADS sequences are still
a work-in-progress [24]–[26] in related fields of research

IV. NUMERICAL ANALYSIS
In this section, the results of a numerical assessment are described and discussed to point out potentialities and limitations
of the ADS-based approach proposed as a suitable tool for predicting the performance of an effective set of planar thinned arrays. For comparison purposes, random arrangements [3], [6]
are considered as reference since, likewise ADS arrays, their

to synthesize an ADS array with a PSL value below that from
random/random lattice distributions.
As far as the radiation patterns are concerned, Figs. 7(b) and
8(c)–10(c) allow one to point out a further interesting property
is a twoof ADS planar arrays. Unlike DSs, where
valued function [6], the unequal magnitudes of the samples of
(Fig. 2) lead to a non-uniform behavior of the array
pattern outside the mainlobe region with some non-negligible
variations of the sidelobes [see Figs. 7(b) and 8(c)–10(c)]. This
can be exploited as an additional degree of freedom to be used
in antenna synthesis. One efficient way to do that is to consider
directive elements.
As an example, let us consider the planar arrays synthewith isotropic or directive elements (e.g.,
sized from
dipoles along the axis). Fig. 11(a) gives the PSL values for
different shifts of the reference set. As it can be observed,
reduces (
vs.
the value of
) thanks to the use of directive elements
and, more interestingly, the optimal shift for the directive
,
array is not equal to that with isotropic elements (
vs.
,
). This is due to the
following. One has to determine the shift generating the lowest
lobes in the whole sidelobe region when dealing with the
“isotropic” array [Fig. 11(b)]. Otherwise, the use of directive
and
values with lowest
elements suggests to choose the
sidelobes only near the mainlobe region [Fig. 11(c)] since
the element factor “erases” the highest sidelobes far from the
mainlobe region in the resulting antenna pattern [Fig. 11(d)].
The last section of the numerical validation is aimed at giving
some indications on the performance of the ADS arrays versus
those coming from state-of-the-art thinning techniques based
on stochastic optimizers [5], [7], [18]. Since ADSs are not still
available in correspondence with the thinning percentage of the
test cases under analysis, the comparison cannot be considered
fully fair, but it can be useful to suggest some guidelines for a
fast and reliable choice of the most suitable synthesis procedure
as well as on the achievable PSL results.
Fig. 12 shows the PSL of the thinned arrays optimized with
the methods in [5], [Fig. 12(a)], [7], [Fig. 12(b)], and [18],

by means of a large set of numerical experiments also aimed
at comparing the predicted ADS performances with those of
random distributions or stochastically optimized arrays.

The obtained results have pointed out the following features
of the ADS thinning technique:

the ADS sequence is available in an explicit form, while
suitable bounds are predictable, otherwise;

sequence;
• thanks to the availability of rich repositories of ADSs also
concerned with large and indexes, wide apertures (impracticable for stochastic optimizers) can be dealt with;
• the use of ADS does not prevent their integration with optimization techniques, vice versa it could represent a way
(to be explored in successive researches) to improve the
convergence rate of iterative methods or for enabling stochastic searches in thinning large arrays by means of a suitable ADS-based initialization.
In addition to these features, other main contributions of the
present paper consist in the following methodological novelties:
1) an innovative and compact analytic formulation for the
analysis of the PSL based on the relations between the
DTFT and the DFT of ADS binary sequences that avoids
the exploitation of the “infinite array” formalism [6], [27]
generally more complicated when dealing with planar arrangements;
2) unlike ADS-based linear arrays [27], the exploitation of the
information on
to derive a
more tight
bound for planar geometries.
Future works will be devoted to further extend the proposed
analysis to other geometries and problems. Moreover, although
out-of-the-scope of the present paper since not pertinent to
antenna arrays but concerned with combinatorial mathematics,
other advances in the research activities concerned with the
explicit determination of other ADS sequences are certainly
expected.
