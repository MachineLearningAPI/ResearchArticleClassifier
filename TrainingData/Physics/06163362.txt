Complex-Weight Sparse Linear Array Synthesis by
Bayesian Compressive Sampling
Giacomo Oliveri, Member, IEEE, Matteo Carlin, and Andrea Massa, Member, IEEE

Abstract—An innovative method for the synthesis of maximally
sparse linear arrays matching arbitrary reference patterns is proposed. In the framework of sparseness constrained optimization,
the approach exploits the multi-task
Bayesian comprestheory to enable the design of complex nonsive sensing
Hermitian layouts with arbitrary radiation and geometrical constraints. By casting the pattern matching problem into a probabilistic formulation, a Relevance-Vector-Machine
technique is used as solution tool. The numerical assessment points out
the advances of the proposed implementation over the extension
to complex patterns of [18] and it gives some indications about the
reliability, flexibility, and numerical efficiency of the
approach also in comparison with state-of-the-art sparse-arrays
synthesis methods.

I. INTRODUCTION AND MOTIVATION

R

ADAR tracking, biomedical imaging, satellite and
ground communications, and remote sensing applications require antenna patterns with suitable sidelobes, null
positions, mainlobe size and shape, and directivity [1]. To
synthesize shaped-beam arrays, several approaches especially
concerned with uniformly-spaced arrangements [1]–[5] have
been proposed over the last sixty years. Although successful
in some applications, uniform arrays have the limitation to
be expensive and heavy when wide apertures are at hand [1]
since a huge amount of radiating elements spaced by
are
needed to avoid grating lobes [6]. Therefore, non-uniform
arrangements have been naturally proposed [6]–[11] because
of their advantages over their regularly-spaced counterparts
(e.g., resolution [12], sidelobe level control/reduction [13],
and efficiency in dealing with physically constrained geometries [14]). State-of-the-art solutions usually consider thinned
regular arrangements to yield a minimum peak sidelobe level
[1], [10], [15], [16] or sparse layouts with the minimum
number of radiating elements given a desired pattern [11],
[17], [18]. Whether several techniques as random thinning

[22]–[24], analytical approaches [10], [15], [25], and hybrid
methodologies [26]–[29] have been investigated for array thinning, few methods have been so far proposed for synthesizing
sparse arrangements [11], [17], [18], [30], [31]. As for these
latter, steepest descent [32], iterative least squares [33], simplex
search [6], and linear programming [34] methodologies have
been firstly developed because of their efficiency. Improved
performances have been successively reached by using recursive inversion techniques [35], [36], stochastic optimizers
[17], generalized Gaussian quadrature approaches [37], and the
matrix pencil method
[11], [30], [31]. More recently,
a new approach based on the Bayesian compressive sensing
[38] has been proposed for the design of sparse layouts
matching user-defined reference patterns [18]. The so-called
“
technique” has been formulated starting from a probabilistic description of the array synthesis [18] then solved by
exploiting an efficient fast relevance vector machine

[38]. Thanks to its efficiency, the
positively compares with state-of-the-art methodologies in
terms of flexibility, synthesis time, and number of array elements, while guaranteeing an excellent pattern matching [18].
However, such a formulation deals with symmetric purely-real
arrangements and its extension to complex syntheses is not

in the framework of the probabilistic sparseness constrained
optimization, an innovative, flexible, and numerically efficient

maximally sparse linear arrays matching a (possibly complex)
reference pattern. Following the guidelines in [18] to recast the
complex-valued synthesis in probabilistic terms and suitably

The solution of the Sparse Vector Synthesis Problem cannot

Equation (8) provides a direct extension of the method in
[18] to deal with complex and non-symmetric arrays. However, such a solution bears an intrinsic limitation. The real
and imaginary
parts of the weights
are managed as independent quantities—see (6)—since each
is treated as statistically independent. See (4)–(6) in [18]. This in turns leads to sparse
layouts where the array weights
are
often either purely real or purely imaginary, neglecting that
sparse complex layouts frequently exhibit non-negligible real
and imaginary components at the same array locations. Such a
drawback generally does not enable the approach to synthesize
very sparse layouts with a good reference pattern matching,
as it has been confirmed by the numerical analysis whose
representative results will be presented in Section III.

A. Sensitivity Analysis
The first set of numerical experiments is concerned with the
sensitivity of the
synthesis on its control parameters, while the reader is referred to [18] for the calibration of
the
approach. Towards this purpose, the synthesis of a
non-uniform array matching a complex-weight “cosecant” pattern with
and
is assumed as reference test case (Fig. 3(b)). Such a pattern can be synthesized by
a uniform layout of
elements
-spaced [2]. The
synthesis is carried out by assuming

and setting the uniform grid of
candidate locations as follows
. Fig. 3(a) shows
the representative points of the synthesized
sparse
layouts in the
plane, along with the associated
Pareto front in such a plane, when varying the control parameters within the ranges:
,
,
,
, and
. These results show that the values of the pattern
matching accuracy lie in the range
with a number
of array elements ranging from a minimum of
up to a maximum of
(Fig. 3(a)). By analyzing the synthesized pattern for three Pareto solutions, namely
[Fig. 3(b)], it turns out that the sparsest
solution
yields a poor approximation of the reference pattern as also confirmed by the corresponding matching
error [
—Fig. 3(a)], while a good fitting is
reached when
active elements are at hand [
—Fig. 3(a)]. A further reduction of the matching
error [e.g.,
—Fig. 3(a)] by using a larger
number of elements
does not provide significant improvements. Therefore, analogous to the guidelines
deduced in [18], an accuracy index close to or below
is identified as the optimal threshold for obtaining a suitable trade-off between pattern matching and reduction of the
number of elements (i.e.,
). As for the associated array structure, the optimal trade-off
layout
(i.e.,
) exhibits a distribution

of the array weights similar to that of the corresponding uniform architecture [2], although with a non-uniform, and larger,
on the average, inter-element spacing [Fig. 3(c)–(d)]. This suggests that the method performs an implicit non-uniform sampling of the ideal current distribution synthesizing
[Fig. 3(c)–(d)]. On the contrary, the non-optimal trade-off solutions differ quite significantly from the uniform distribution case
[e.g.,

Fig. 4(b) shows that the values of the two indexes are almost
constant when

Such a behavior is actually expected from the
theory. See Section II-C and the Appendix. Indeed, larger
values correspond to less accurate pattern approximations [see
(2)] as well as less sparsely filled layouts. Consequently, good
trade-offs between accuracy and sparseness are expected by
choosing

[Fig. 4(c)]. Larger values of
yield more sparsely filled layouts, while smaller priors provide higher accuracies [Fig. 4(d)].
Consequently, the ranges for the scale priors have been set to

, respectively.
As far as the lattice grid is concerned, Fig. 4(e) shows
that the matching accuracy is quite stable if
,
while larger/smaller
values result in a sharp increase of

complexity of the problem at hand since its size grows with .
A trade-off value within

suggested.
The obtained tradeoff margins range from a
ratio [for

ratio [for
and —Fig. 4(b) and
(c)]. Such a behavior, caused by the different physical meaning
of each parameter (see discussion above), does not actually represent a big issue for the proposed design methodology. In fact,
quite wide ranges exist for which the method performances are
almost constant. Furthermore, the
-based

a “smoother” dependence on its control parameters than the
single-task
approach. Indeed, unlike the

generally exhibits nearly monotone behavior versus control
parameters [e.g., Fig. 4(a)–(e)] and
presents reduced oscillations given very large parameter variations [e.g.,
Fig. 4(c)]. Thus

robustness than
for any reference pattern or aperture.

Assessment

For numerical assessment, we consider both unconstrained
(Section III-B-I) and constrained problems (Section III-B-II),
where forbidden regions are defined in the pattern region
[Section I] or on the array geometry [Section II]. Concerning
the unconstrained syntheses, the analysis aims at performing a
consistency check to assess the reliability of the
in dealing with problems also manageable by the original
approach [18] [Section I] and successively detailing the
performance applied to the synthesis of arbitrary
unconstrained patterns also in comparison with state-of-the-art
methods [Sections II–III].

To further assess that such a behavior is due to the symmetry properties of the pattern at hand, the next numerical experiment is concerned with a set of Hermitian patterns derived
from [17]. The results of the synthesis of the three layouts with

2315

[17])—ARRAY PERFORMANCE INDEXES

are presented in Table II and compared with the sparse arrangements generated by a stochastic
methodology based on simulated-annealing
[17]. As it can
be observed, the
and
procedures achieve similar performances for each qualitative index (e.g., the matching
accuracy and the array aperture) with an element saving equal
or better than that of the stochastic approach (Table II). This
is also visually confirmed by the plots in Fig. 6 related to the
representative example characterized by
and
[17]. With reference to the layout with
elements, it turns out that an acceptable fidelity
[
—Fig. 6(b)] is yielded by both
-based
methods despite the reduction of the array elements with respect
to the
-optimized sparse solution
. The similarities are not limited to the patterns, but as expected, are apparent
also in the distribution of the real array coefficients [Fig. 6(c)].
ii) Symmetric Power Patterns: Unlike Hermitian patterns,
and
syntheses are expected to differ
when only the reference power pattern is symmetric. The
results from the synthesis of a non-Hermitian flat-top array
(
—[3]) with symmetric power pattern [Fig. 7(a)]
and asymmetric phase distribution [Fig. 7(b)] reveal the enhanced effectiveness of the
procedure, which is due to
its improved accuracy in modelling the statistical relations between the (non-negligible) real and imaginary parts of the array
weights. As far as the optimal
-based trade-off solutions
are concerned, it turns out that there is a halving of the array
elements [
vs.
—Table I] along
with similar matching accuracies [
vs.
—Table I]. This latter is mainly due
to the intrinsic limitation of the
approach to deal with the
two components of the array excitations as correlated unknowns
[(6)]. Indeed, several
weights turn out either purely real
or purely imaginary [
—Fig. 7(d)]
unlike the
coefficients.
iii) Asymmetric Power Patterns: The improvements of the
approach are expected to be even more impressive
when asymmetric patterns are at hand. In order to analyze such
a case, the next example deals with the synthesis of a
cosecant pattern from [3] [
, Fig. 8(b)]. The Pareto
solutions in the
plane [Fig. 8(a)] clearly indicate
that the multi-task procedure is far more efficient than the
single-task one. Indeed, the
yields sparser layouts
for a fixed threshold [e.g.,
when
—Fig. 8(a)], and a higher accuracy for a given [e.g.,
when
—Fig. 8(a)]. As

coefficients [Fig. 8(c)–(d)] of the representative solutions circled in Fig. 8(a) [

As far as the array layouts are concerned, it is worth noticing
that an element saving of
and an aperture reduction of
with respect to the uniform solution are obtained by the
without compromising the pattern matching
accuracy (Table I), while the
fails in reducing the array
elements
. Moreover, the behavior
of the array excitations over the aperture confirms that the
non-uniform
distribution follows the uniform
one since the pattern matching refers to the complex reference
pattern and not only to the power pattern, thus constraining
both amplitudes and phases of the array coefficients.
To provide a more exhaustive comparison of the
methodologies, the results of an extensive analysis on
asymmetric “cosecant” reference patterns with constant
sidelobes are presented. More specifically, the reference patterns have been chosen such that

technique always outperforms
the single-task method with significantly sparser solutions
(

true also when lowering the sidelobe level (Fig. 9). On the
other hand, although more array elements are necessary as

increases, the
always enables a reduction
of the array elements with respect to the uniform architectures (Fig. 9—
), while the condition
is mandatory for the BCS to reach the accuracy

vs.
—Table III]. The effectiveness of the
to reduce the number of elements in the array
arrangement is pictorially highlighted in the representative
example analyzed in Fig. 10 (
). Whatever the
matching accuracy, the
patterns exhibit a higher
sparseness [Fig. 10(a)–(f)] than the
. Furthermore, the
pattern matching of the
solution is always better
for a given value of [Fig. 10(a), (c), (e)].
The
approach is usually faster3 than the multi-task procedure, although both methods do not require heavy computations [
s—Table III]. This is expected since neglecting
the relationships between real and imaginary parts of the array
excitations (see Section II) simplifies the problem, but significantly degrades the synthesis performance with complex layouts.
As for the state-of-the-art comparisons, let us refer to
recently introduced approaches based on the Matrix Pencil
Method (
) [11], [30], [31], [44]. Such a choice is mainly
due to their effectiveness and numerical efficiency usually
outperforming other sparse-synthesis methods in terms of
convergence speed, reliability, and accuracy [11], [30], [31].
The first set of comparisons is concerned with the benchmark case in [43]. The synthesis results are reported in
Fig. 11(a)–(b) and quantitatively compared in Table IV. With
reference to the
-plane [Fig. 11(a)], the stand-alone
matrix pencil method [30] is, as expected, significantly less
accurate (
:
[Fig. 11(b)] vs.
—Table IV) than the sub-optimal (i.e.,
)
because of the shaped-beam reference
pattern [11], while the hybrid
[44] reaches a comparable pattern matching (
:
—Table IV) although requiring
a non-negligible computational burden [44] because of the
-based stochastic optimization in the second step of the
hybrid procedure.
Concerning the so-called forward-backward version of
the matrix pencil method
[31], the results in
Fig. 11(c)–(f) derived from [45], [46] (also discussed in [31])
point out that the
exhibits performance close

insights about the efficiency of the
in dealing
with shaped reference patterns as well as about its advances in
terms of element sparseness, matching accuracy, final layout
properties, and numerical efficiency over the standard

in comparison with reference state-of-the-art methodologies.
The final set of experiments, concerned with an equi-ripple
cosecant reference pattern generated by a
uniform aperture of

-based methodology to handle constrained sparse-array
syntheses. Performing constrained sparse synthesis is not a
trivial task for a wide range of state-of-the-art methods, except
for optimization methods which, however, usually involve
heavy computations when high-dimension solution spaces are
at hand.

Fig. 15(d)–(f)] despite the non-negligible aperture blockage

in both cases). Furthermore, the
technique confirms also in those scenarios its higher efficiency (than the

with respect to the (unconstrained) uniform solution

out to be lower than that for the “unconstrained”
-based
syntheses because of the greater complexity of the synthesis at hand [i.e.,

(symmetric forbidden region) and
and
(asymmetric forbidden region)].
IV. CONCLUSIONS
An innovative, flexible, and efficient complement to the
existing approaches for the synthesis of sparse layouts with
arbitrary radiation features has been proposed. The proposed
method extends the range of applicability of the technique in
[18] by considering a
Bayesian methodology. Towards this
end, the original pattern matching problem has been formulated

in a Bayesian fashion within the framework of the sparseness
constrained optimization and afterwards it has been solved by a
suitable
-derived methodology. Selected results from an
extensive numerical validation have been presented to provide
an evaluation of the sensitivity of the
method to
its control parameters as well as on its accuracy, flexibility, and
computational efficiency. Advantages and limitations of the
proposed approach have been pointed out using comparisons
with state-of-the-art approaches. In summary:
• the
technique is simpler to calibrate than the
single-task
approach thanks to its smoother dependency on the control parameters (Section III-A);
• the
methodology outperforms the single-task
procedure since, generally, the
extension to

complex layouts often yields to (sub-optimal) arrangements mostly comprising purely-real and purely-imaginary excitations. As expected,
-based procedures
provide very similar results when symmetric real layouts
are at hand (Section III-B-I);
• on average, the
guarantees an element
saving with respect to (
-spaced) uniform layouts of
about
when complex- or
real-valued symmetric patterns are at hand still providing
an excellent pattern matching [
];
• the
favorably compares with state-of-the-art
sparse array design procedures in terms of pattern
matching accuracy, element saving, numerical efficiency,
and stability;
• additional constraints on the radiation pattern and/or the
geometrical features of the sparse array can be easily and
efficiently dealt with (Section III-B-II).
In addition, other main and innovative contributions of this
paper consist in the following methodological novelties:
1) an extension to the complex-valued synthesis problems of
the
approach in [18];
2) an innovative and equivalent “fictitious” formulation of the
complex-weight pattern matching problem for enabling the
;
application of the
3) an innovative
method for dealing with complex-valued sparseness constrained optimization by statically correlating the real and the imaginary components of
the sparse unknowns.
Future works, out-of-the-scope of the present paper, will be
aimed at analyzing the mutual coupling effects between real
elements in the sparse layouts as well as at taking into account
in the synthesis process the presence of directive elements.
Furthermore, the derivation of array processing algorithms
(i.e.,
-estimation [48] and adaptive beamforming [49]
techniques) based on
geometries will be the
subject of future analyses aimed at exploiting and integrating
the features of such a sparse arrangements in an effective and
customized way.
