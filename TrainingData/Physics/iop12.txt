Two-dimensional (2D) effective continuous models are derived for
the surface states and thin films of a three-dimensional topological insulator
(3DTI). Starting from an effective model for 3DTI based on first-principles
calculations (Zhang et al 2009 Nat. Phys. 5 438), we present solutions for
both the surface states in a semi-infinite boundary condition and those in a thin
film with finite thickness. The coupling between opposite topological surfaces
and structure inversion asymmetry (SIA) gives rise to gapped Dirac hyperbolas
with Rashba-like splittings in the energy spectrum. In addition, SIA leads to
asymmetric distributions of wavefunctions for the surface states along the film
growth direction, making some branches in the energy spectra much harder than
others to probe by light. These features agree well with the recent angle-resolved
photoemission spectra of Bi2 Se3 films grown on SiC substrate (Zhang et al 2009
arXiv:0911.3706). More importantly, using the parameters fitted by experimental
data, the result indicates that the thin film Bi2 Se3 lies in the quantum spin Hall
(QSH) region based on the calculation of the Chern number and Z 2 invariant. In
addition, strong SIA always tends to destroy the QSH state.

1. Introduction

Topological insulators (TIs), which are band insulators with topologically protected edge or
surface states, have attracted increasing attention recently [1]2 . A well-known TI paradigm
is the quantum Hall effect, in which the cyclotron motion of electrons in a strong magnetic
field gives rise to insulating bulk states but one-way conducting states propagating along edges
of the system [2]. The idea was generalized to a graphene model with spin–orbit coupling,
which exhibits the quantum spin Hall (QSH) state [3, 4]. Later, the realization of an existing
QSH matter was predicted theoretically [5] and soon confirmed experimentally [6, 7] in twodimensional (2D) HgTe/CdTe quantum wells. Furthermore, it was found that the QSH state
can be induced even by disorders or impurities [8]–[10]. Meanwhile, the concept was also
generalized for three-dimensional (3D) TIs, which are 3D band insulators surrounded by 2D
conducting surface states with quantum spin texture [11]–[14]. Bix Sb1−x , an alloy with a
complex structure of surface states, was first confirmed to be a three-dimensional topological
insulator (3DTI) [15, 16]. Soon after that, it was verified by both experiments [17, 18] and
first-principles calculations [19] that stoichiometric crystals Bi2 X 3 (X = Se, Te) are TIs with
a well-defined single Dirac cone of surface states and extra large bandgaps comparable with

room temperature. The Dirac fermions in the surface states of 3DTI obey the 2 + 1 Dirac
equations and reveal a lot of unconventional properties and possible applications, such as
the topological magneto-electric effect [20] and Majorana fermions for fault-tolerant quantum
computing [21]–[26].
Thanks to the state-of-the-art semiconductor technologies, low-dimensional structures of
Bi2 X 3 can be routinely fabricated into ultrathin films [27, 28] and nanoribbons [29]. This has
stimulated several theoretical works on the thin films of 3DTIs [30]–[32]. For further studies of
the transport and optical properties of 3DTI films and their potential applications in spintronics
and quantum information, it is desirable to establish an effective continuous model for thin
films of TIs.
In this paper, we present an effective continuous model for the surface states and
ultrathin film of TIs. Starting with a 3D effective low-energy model based on first-principles
calculations [19], we first present the solutions for the surface states and the corresponding
spectra for a semi-infinite boundary condition of gapless Dirac fermions and for the thin film
of TIs. The finite size effect of spatial confinement in a thin film leads to a massive Dirac
model that may exhibit the QSH effect. Within the same theoretical framework, a structure
inversion asymmetry (SIA) term is further introduced in this work to account for the influence
of substrate, providing a description of the Rashba-like energy spectra observed in the angleresolved photoemission spectra (ARPES) in a recent experiment on Bi2 Se3 films [28]. We
derived the parameter conditions for the formation of the QSH effect in a thin film in the absence
and presence of the SIA. By analyzing the fitting parameters with the help of the Chern number
and Z 2 invariant, we identified the ultrathin films of Bi2 Se3 in the QSH phase in the experiment.
The paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we introduce an anisotropic 3D
Hamiltonian for 3DTI, which is a starting point of the present work. With this Hamiltonian,
we present detailed solutions to the thin film in two different boundary conditions. In section 3,
effective continuous models are established for the surface states and thin film of 3DTI. Within
the framework of this effective continuous model, the SIA is taken into account and an effective
Hamiltonian for SIA is derived in section 4. In section 5, we apply the model to newly fabricated
thin film Bi2 Se3 and demonstrate that thin films of Bi2 Se3 are in the QSH regime. Finally, the
conclusion is presented in section 6.

of the film is L. We assume translational symmetry in the x–y plane so that the wave numbers

k x and k y are good quantum numbers. We start with the effective model proposed to describe
the bulk states near the point for bulk Bi2 Se3 [19]. The states are mainly contributed by four

where + (−) stands for even (odd) parity. The Hamiltonian is given by

with A1 , A2 , B1 , B2 , C, D1 , D2 and M being the model parameters. This model has
time-reversal symmetry and inversion symmetry. Although we start with a concrete model, the
conclusion in this paper should be applicable to other TI films. We shall demonstrate that this
model for bulk states can produce surface states with appropriate boundary conditions.
2.2. General solutions of the surface states
Following the method of Zhou et al [33], the general solution for either the bulk states or the
surface states can be derived analytically. Despite the existence of time-reversal symmetry, the
A2 k± term couples opposite spins in Hamiltonian (1), and one has to solve a 4 × 4 matrix,
instead of the simplified 2 × 2 one in the 2D case [33]. By putting a four-component trial

with the superposition coefficients Cαβγ to be determined by boundary conditions. In the
following, we will consider two different boundary conditions: one is semi-infinite focusing
on only one surface at z = 0; the other includes two opposite surfaces at z = ±L/2. In both
cases, we assume open boundary conditions ( = 0) for the surface states at the surfaces.
2.3. Solutions for the surface states with semi-infinite boundary conditions
The surface states have a finite distribution near the boundary. For a film thick enough that the
states at opposite surfaces barely couple to each other, we can focus on just one surface. Without
loss of generality, we study a system from z = 0 to +∞. The boundary condition is given as
(z = 0) = 0

and

(z → +∞) = 0.

(10)

The condition of (z → +∞) = 0 requires that contains only the four terms in which β is
negative and that the real part of λα be positive.
Applying the boundary conditions of equation (10) to the general solution of equation (9),
the secular equation of the nontrivial solution to the coefficients Cαβγ leads to

the wavefunctions in equation (13). In addition, there exist complex solutions to λα when

2.4. Solutions for finite-thickness boundary conditions
When the thickness of the film is comparable with the characteristic length 1/λ1,2 of the
surface states, there is coupling between the states on opposite surfaces. One has to consider
the boundary conditions at both surfaces simultaneously. Without loss of generality, we will
consider that the top surface is located at z = L/2 and the bottom surface at −L/2. The
boundary conditions are given as

In this case, the general solution consists of all eight linearly independent functions. Applying

In a large L limit, tanh(λα L/2) reduces to 1; then equation (17) can recover the result in
equation (11). With the help of equation (5), equation (17) can be used to identify the energy
spectra and the values of λα numerically.
Due to the finite size effect [33], the coupling between the states at the top and bottom
surfaces will open an energy gap. We define the gap as = E + − E − at the point, where
E + and E − are two solutions of equation (17). For λα L
1 and λ2 λ1 (L can be finite), the
approximate expression for can be found. If λα is real, the gap can be approximated by
4|A1 D+ D− M|

which decays exponentially as a function of L. Figure 2(a) shows the gap as a function of
thickness, in which a set of model parameters used to fit the ARPES of 4 QL Bi2 Se3 thin film is
employed, as listed in the first row of table 1.
For some other materials there may exist complex λ1 = λ∗2 and we can define λ1 = a − ib
and λ2 = a + ib, where a > 0 and b > 0 according to equation (5). In this case, the gap is found
to be

3. Effective continuous models

The solutions of the surface states and thin film of 3DTI can be applied to calculate physical
properties explicitly. For instance, we can see whether the ground state of a thin film exhibits
QSHE or not by calculating the Chern number or Z2 invariant. It is also desirable to establish
an effective continuous model to explore the properties of these surface states, especially
when other interactions have to be taken into account. For this purpose, in this section
we derive effective low-energy and continuous models for the surface states and thin film
of 3DTI.

Due to the low-energy long-wavelength nature of the Dirac cone of the surface electrons,
we can use the solutions of the surface states at the point as a basis to expand the Hamiltonian
H (k) in equation (1), which will be valid when the energy is limited within the bandgap
between the conduction and valence bands. This is equivalent to a truncation approximation
as we exclude the solutions for the bulk states in the basis. In this approach, the Hamiltonian in
equation (1) can be expressed as
H (k) = H0 (k = 0) +

The first term can be solved exactly, and the last term describes the behaviors of electrons near
the point.
3.1. Basis states at the

H0 in equation (23) is block-diagonal. Its solution can be found by solving each block separately,
i.e. h(A1 ) ↑ = E ↑ and h(−A1 ) ↓ = E ↓ . Because the lower block is the ‘time’ reversal of
the upper block, the solutions satisfy ↓ (z) =
= −i σ y K is the time-reversal
↑ (z), where
operator, with σ y being the y-component of the Pauli matrices and K the complex conjugation
operation. Equivalently, we can replace A1 by −A1 in all the results for the upper block, to
obtain those for the lower block. Therefore, we only need to solve h(A1 ). Following the same
approach as that in section 2, we put a two-component trial solution

four solutions are for the surface states, and the solutions for the bulk states are not presented
here. We use the four states as the basis states, and other states are discarded (except that in
figure 3 where four extra bulk states are also included by the same approach), because of a large
gap between the valence and conduction bands.

The d(k) vectors in case I and case II, respectively, correspond to Dresselhaus- and Rashba-like

wells [5]. However, we find that case I only occurs for quite a small range of thickness. For

most thicknesses of interest, A
the following discussions. So far, we have reduced the anisotropic 3D Dirac model into a
generalized effective model for 2D thin films, under the freestanding open boundary conditions.
3.3. Effective continuous model for surface states
Despite the simple explicit form, the parameters in Hamiltonian (40) need to be determined
numerically. Before that, we can take two limits to see their behaviors. The first limit is λα L
1,
for α = 1, 2. In this case, tanh(λα L/2) 1, and both equations (30) and (31) reduce to
(C − M − E − D+ λ21 )λ2 = (C − M − E − D+ λ22 )λ1 .

h¯
and B1 = B2 , the quadratic term disappears and we have a linear dispersion for the Dirac cone.
Finally, it is noticed that the models for the surface states at the top and bottom surfaces have
the same form assuming λα L 1. We will see that these results work well even for films down
to 5 QL of atoms in thickness (1 QL is about 1 nm).
3.4. The ultrathin limit
Another opposite limit is L → 0, which is a little bit complicated since λα L does not approach
zero when L is very small. In equation (30), the left side has an order of L 2 when L → 0, so
tanh(λ1 L/2) must have the order of L −2 , which means

It is found that a finite energy gap opens at k = 0, i.e. = 2B1 π 2 /L 2 as shown in figure 2. Note
that this result in the L → 0 limit even provides a rough estimate of the gap for most thicknesses.
Besides, the continuum limit generally assumed in this work also works well even for several
QLs.
4. Structure inversion asymmetry

4.1. SIA
A recent experiment [28] revealed that the substrate on which the film is grown influences
dramatically the electronic structure inside the film. Because the top surface of the film is usually
exposed to the vacuum and the bottom surface is attached to a substrate, the inversion symmetry
does not hold along the z-direction, leading to the Rashba-like energy spectra for the gapped
surface states. In this case, an extra term that describes the SIA needs to be taken into account
in the effective model.
We use the same method as that in section 3 to include the SIA term. Without loss of
generality, we add a potential energy V (z) to the Hamiltonian. Generally speaking, V (z) can
be expressed as V (z) = Vs (z) + Va (z), in which Vs (z) = Vs (−z) and Va (z) = −Va (−z). The
symmetric term Vs could contribute to the mass term
in the effective model, which may
lead to energy splitting of the Dirac cone at the point. We do not discuss this in detail in
this paper. Here, we focus on the case of the antisymmetric term, V (z) = Va (z), which breaks
the top–bottom inversion symmetry in the Hamiltonian. A detailed analysis demonstrates that

Va (z) couples 1 ( 3 ) to 2 ( 4 ), which can be readily seen according to their spin and parity
natures. The modified effective Hamiltonian in the presence of V (z) becomes

symmetric TI film, and it has a single gapless Dirac cone on each of its two surfaces, with
solid and dashed lines for the top and bottom surfaces, respectively. The two Dirac cones are
degenerate. The top of figure 4 indicates that the inter-surface coupling across an ultrathin film

will turn the Dirac cones into gapped Dirac hyperbolas. At the bottom of figure 4, SIA lifts the
Dirac cone at the top surface while lowering the Dirac cone at the bottom surface. The potential
difference at the top and bottom surfaces removes the degeneracy of the Dirac cones. On the
right of figure 4, the coexistence of both inter-surface coupling and SIA leads to two gapped
Dirac hyperbolas which also split in the k-direction, as shown in figure 3.

The location of the surface states can be revealed by evaluating the expectation of position z of
these states. The spatial distributions along the z-direction of a state ψα can be evaluated by the

blue for z = L/2 (the top surface) and light green for z = −L/2 (the substrate or bottom
surface).
For a thin film of 4 QL, L = 3.8 nm, it is found that the two surface states are well separated
and dominantly distributed near the two surfaces. The averaged z
±L/3, which is about 2/3
of a QL (≈ L/6) deviating from the surface. In this case, the top and bottom surface states are
well defined even without the SIA (V˜ = 0 ). The average value remains almost unchanged in
a large range of k. However, at the crossing point of the spectra of the top and bottom surface
states, the averaged z changes from +L/3 to 0, and then goes to the value of −L/3. This
demonstrates that the finite thickness makes the two states couple with each other as their
wavefunctions along the z-direction have a finite overlap. As a result, the two states open an
energy gap as in the case of edge states in the QSH system [33]. The value of the gap is a
function of L as shown in figures 2(a) and (b). Near this region, z varies from z
L/3 to
−L/3, and becomes zero exactly when two states are mixed completely. For a large L, we find
that the averaged distance of the surface states deviating from the surface remains about 1 QL.
Simply speaking, the states close to the top surface are easier to probe by light than those
close to the bottom surface. This provides a hint to understand why there are branches in energy
spectra with much more faint ARPES signals [28].
5. Bi2 Se3 thin films and QSH states

In this section, we will investigate the realization of the QSH effect in thin films and apply the
effective model to Bi2 Se3 thin films. When the system does not break the inversion symmetry,
the effective Hamiltonian is block-diagonalized by τz = ±1. This is in good agreement with the
theory of Murakami et al [35]. In this case we can define a τz -dependent Chern number (Hall
conductance) for each block like the spin Chern number [36], from which the nontrivial QSH
phase can be identified. After introducing the SIA term, the τz -dependent Chern number loses its
meaning as the two blocks are mixed together. However, we can still employ the Z 2 topological
classification [4], which requires no inversion symmetry, to identify possible QSH thin films in
experiment.
5.1. QSH effect without SIA
Considering the block-diagonal form of the effective model without SIA (40), we can derive
the Hall conductance for each block, separately. For the 2 × 2 Hamiltonian in terms of the d(k)
vectors and Pauli matrices in equation (45), the Kubo formula for the Hall conductance can be
generally expressed as [37, 38]

being the chemical potential, kB the Boltzmann constant and T the temperature.
At zero temperature and when the chemical potential µ lies between the bandgap

(− 2 , 2 ), the Fermi functions reduce to f k,+ = 0 and f k,− = 1. In this case, we have [31]
σxτyz = −τz

2h

(61)

This result intuitively shows that only when B and have the same sign is the Chern number
equal to +1 or −1, which is topologically nontrivial, and the Hall conductance is quantized to
be ±e2/h. In other words, the QSH depends not only on the sign of at the point but also on
that of B for large enough k. Experimentally, the τz -dependent Hall conductance can be probed
by a nonlocal measurement, just like that for 2D CdTe/HgTe quantum wells [7].
5.2. QSH effect with SIA: Z2 invariant
In the presence of SIA, V˜ couples the blocks h + and h − , so the τz -dependent Hall conductance
becomes nonsense. Following Kane and Mele [4], we can employ the Z 2 topological
classification to give a criterion of the QSH phase, because it does not require inversion
symmetry as a necessary condition. The Z 2 index can be obtained by counting the number
of pairs of complex zeros of P(k) ≡ Pf[A(k)], where the Pfaffian is defined as

in which N counts the number of times of permutations, and A(k) is a 2n order anti-symmetric
matrix defined by the overlaps of time reversal

(63)

with i, j run over all the bands below the Fermi surface, i.e. ψ1− and ψ2− in the present
case according to equations (58) and (59). Based on the spin nature of the basis states
{ 1 , 4 , 2 , 3 } in our effective model, the time-reversal operator here is defined as ≡
iσx ⊗ σ y K, where σx and σ y are the x- and y-components of Pauli matrices, respectively, and
K the complex conjugate operator. The number of pairs of zeros can be counted by evaluating
the winding of the phase of P(k) around a contour C enclosing half of the complex plane of
k = k x + ik y ,

dk · ∇k log[P(k) + iδ].

Because the model is isotropic, we can choose C to enclose the upper half-plane; the integral
then reduces to only the path along the k x -axis, while the part of the half-circle integral vanishes
for δ>0 and |k| → +∞.
In the absence of the SIA term, P(k) is found, for the Hamiltonian (44), to be

in which one can check that the zero points exist only when k 2 = /2B >0, and form a circular
ring. Along the k x -axis, only one of a pair of zeros in the ring is enclosed in the contour C ,
which gives a Z 2 index I = 1. This defines the nontrivial QSH phase and is consistent with the
conclusion from the Hall conductance in equation (61).
√
In the presence of a small SIA term V˜ < h¯ vF | /2B|, with the help of the eigenwavefunctions (58) and (59), real P(k) can be found (after a U (1) rotation) to be
P(k) =

(t + E −in )(t + E −out ) + |V˜ |2 − (h¯ vF k)2 sgn(h¯ vF k − |V˜ |),
2 E −in E −out (t + E −in )(t + E −out )

0,

(66)

where the sgn is to secure the continuity of P(k). One can check that P(0) = −sgn( ) and
P(∞) = sgn(B). Besides, for a small V˜ , the behavior of P(k) between P(0) and P(∞) will
not change qualitatively (see figure√5). Therefore, for B >0, P(k x , 0) should still have odd
pairs of zeros. For a large V˜ h¯ vF | /2B|,
P(k) =

(t + E −in )(t + E −out ) + |V˜ |2 − (h¯ vF k)2

(67)

One can check that for this case, P(0)P(∞) is always positive; thus P(k) has even pairs of
zeros, regardless of the signs and values of and B. In other words, a large SIA will always
destroy the QSH phase.
5.3. Bi2 Se3 thin films and the QSH effect
Recently, the thickness-dependent band structure of molecular beam epitaxy grown ultrathin
films Bi2 Se3 was investigated by in situ angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy [28]. An
energy gap was first observed experimentally in the surface states of Bi2 Se3 below the thickness
of 6 QL, which confirms the theoretical prediction as a finite size effect [30]–[33] .
Table 2 shows the fitting parameters for the ARPES data of Bi2 Se3 thin films [28] using
the energy spectrum formula (equation (56)). For the√films with thickness ranging from 2 QL
to 5 QL, all of them satisfy sgn ( B)>0 and V˜ < h¯ vF | /2B|, hence the films are possibly in
the QSH regime. We identify that only 2 QL, 3 QL, and 4 QL belong to the nontrivial case for
the potential QSH effect. 5 QL is an exceptional case where the fitted parameters B and D do
not satisfy the existence condition of an edge state solution [33]. The condition of B 2 < D 2 will
lead to the bandgap closing for a large k. However, it is understood that the model is only valid

near the point, and the fitting parameters are limited to the case of small k. The band gap was
measured clearly for the film of 5 QL.
It was previously predicted, using the parameters from first-principles calculations [19],
that the gap
should oscillate as a function of the film thickness [30]–[32]. However, this
oscillation is not reflected in the measured results.
5.4. QSH effect of SIA and the edge states
In the quantum Hall effect, the Chern number of the bulk states has an explicit correspondence
to the number of edge states in an open boundary condition [39]. In the TI or QSH system,
the Z 2 topological invariant has also a relation to the number of helical edge states [40]. As
supplementary support to the above conclusion, we demonstrated the presence of edge states
in a periodic boundary condition along the x-direction and an open boundary condition (say
along the y-direction) imposed in a geometry of a strip of the thin film by means of numerical

calculation. Using the parameters in table 1, we have concluded that a strip of 2–4 QL will
exhibit helical edge states. More specifically, we present the energy dispersion for 4 QL in
figure 6. There is a doubly degenerate Dirac point inside the gap of the 2D surface states for 4
QL consistent with the results obtained in the above sections.
6. Conclusions

We derived 2D effective continuous models for the surface states and thin films of 3DTI.
A gapless Dirac cone was confirmed for the surface states of a 3DTI. For a thin film, the coupling
between opposite topological surface states in space opens an energy gap, and the Dirac cone
evolves into a gapped Dirac hyperbola. The thin film may break the top–bottom symmetry. For
example, the thin film grows on a substrate, and possesses SIA. This SIA leads to Rashba-like
coupling and energy splitting in the momentum space. It also leads to asymmetric distributions
of states along the film growth direction.
The ARPES measurements on Bi2 Se3 films have demonstrated that the surface spectra open
a visible energy gap when the thickness is below 6 QLs. The energy gap was observed to be a
function of the thickness of the thin film, and in good agreement with theoretical prediction as a
finite size effect of the thickness of thin film. The Rashba-like splitting was measured clearly in
the thin film of 2–6 QLs. This can be explained very well from the inclusion of the SIA. Since
the thin film was grown on an SiC substrate and the other surface is exposed to the vacuum, this
fact results in the SIA in the thin film. Another piece of direct evidence to support the SIA is the
signal intensity pattern of the energy spectra of ARPES. Usually the surface states are located
dominantly near the top and bottom surfaces. The signal intensity for these two branches of
energy spectra of ARPES are different. The SIA will cause the coupling between two surface
states near their crossing point. That is why the Rashba-like splitting of the ARPES spectra has
a bright crossing point near the point, with one branch bright and the other almost invisible.

Thus the SIA term can be used to describe the ARPES measurements on Bi2 Se3 thin films very
well.
Our effective model demonstrates that the 3DTI can be reduced to a 2D QSH due to spatial
confinement. Strictly speaking, the system is no longer a 3DTI in the original sense once the
energy gap opens in the surface bands, since the Z 2 invariant for the bulk states becomes zero.
However, the surface bands themselves may contribute a nontrivial one in the Z 2 invariant even
when the SIA term is included. Our calculation demonstrates that a strong SIA always tends to
destroy the QSH effect. A critical value for SIA exists at the point where there is a transition
from a topological trivial to nontrivial phase. Based on the model parameters fitted from
the experimental data of ARPES, we conclude that the Bi2 Se3 thin films should exhibit the
QSH effect once the energy gap opens in the surface spectra due to the spatial confinement of
the thin film.

Appendix. Model parameters A˜ 2 and V˜

In this appendix, we demonstrate that both parameters A˜ 2 and V˜ in the effective model (40)
can be either real or purely imaginary, and the product of A˜ 2 V˜ must be purely imaginary. By
putting the wavefunctions equations (32) and (33) into the definitions in equations (42) and (52),

For arbitrary energy, equation (5) requires that the values of λ1 and λ2 be only one of the
combinations shown in table A.1. By putting these combinations into equations (34)–(37), one
can show that for the first entry, η1 and η2 are real, while f + and f − are purely imaginary,
referred to as case A; while for entries 2–4, all of η1 , η2 , f + and f − are real, referred to as case
B. For an arbitrary group of E + and E − , each of them belongs to either case A or B, leading
to four possibilities, as shown in table A.2. In particular, according to equation (15), when
A21 /(−D+ D− ) > 4M/B1 , there is no complex λ1,2 , corresponding to the last row of table A.2,
˜ 2 is purely imaginary, while V˜ is real.
