The most striking feature of quantum mechanics is the existence
of superposition states, where an object appears to be in different situations
at the same time. The existence of such states has been previously tested
with small objects, such as atoms, ions, electrons and photons (Zoller et al
2005 Eur. Phys. J. D 36 203–28), and even with molecules (Arndt et al 1999
Nature 401 680–2). More recently, it has been shown that it is possible to
create superpositions of collections of photons (Deléglise et al 2008 Nature
455 510–14), atoms (Hammerer et al 2008 arXiv:0807.3358) or Cooper pairs
(Friedman et al 2000 Nature 406 43–6). Very recent progress in optomechanical
systems may soon allow us to create superpositions of even larger objects,
such as micro-sized mirrors or cantilevers (Marshall et al 2003 Phys. Rev. Lett.
91 130401; Kippenberg and Vahala 2008 Science 321 1172–6; Marquardt and
Girvin 2009 Physics 2 40; Favero and Karrai 2009 Nature Photon. 3 201–5), and
thus to test quantum mechanical phenomena at larger scales. Here we propose a
method to cool down and create quantum superpositions of the motion of subwavelength, arbitrarily shaped dielectric objects trapped inside a high-finesse
cavity at a very low pressure. Our method is ideally suited for the smallest
living organisms, such as viruses, which survive under low-vacuum pressures
(Rothschild and Mancinelli 2001 Nature 406 1092–101) and optically behave
as dielectric objects (Ashkin and Dziedzic 1987 Science 235 1517–20). This
opens up the possibility of testing the quantum nature of living organisms by

creating quantum superposition states in very much the same spirit as the original
Schrödinger’s cat ‘gedanken’ paradigm (Schrödinger 1935 Naturwissenschaften
23 807–12, 823–8, 844–9). We anticipate that our paper will be a starting point
for experimentally addressing fundamental questions, such as the role of life and
consciousness in quantum mechanics.

The ultimate goal of quantum optomechanics is to push the motion of macroscopic objects
towards the quantum limit, and it is a subject of interest in both fundamental and applied
science [4]–[6]. The typical experimental set-up consists of an optical cavity whose resonance
frequency depends on the displacement of some mechanical oscillator. The mechanical motion
shifts the resonance frequency and, consequently, the radiation pressure exerted into the
mechanical object. The overall effect yields the optomechanical coupling, which should enable
us to cool down to the ground state the mechanical motion [9]–[11]. We are currently witnessing
an experimental race to reach the ground state using different set-ups, such as nano- or
microcantilevers [12], membranes [13], or vibrating microtoroids [14]. It is expected that the
achievement of the ground state will open up the possibility to perform fundamental and applied
experiments involving quantum phenomena with these macroscopic objects, as pioneered by the
works [3], [15]–[17].
In this paper, we propose dielectric objects levitating inside the cavity as new quantum
optomechanical systems. The fact that these are not attached to other mechanical objects avoids
the main source of heating, which is present in other optomechanical systems, and thus, should
facilitate the achievement of ground state cooling. Once this is achieved, we propose to create
quantum superpositions of the center-of-mass motional state of the object by sending a light
pulse to the cavity, which is simultaneously pumped with a strong field. One of the main
features of this proposal is that it applies to a wide variety of new objects and, in particular,
to certain living organisms. Therefore, our proposal paves the path for the experimental test of
the superposition principle with living creatures.
We consider an object with mass M, volume V and relative dielectric constant r = 1,
which may be non-homogeneous. The object is trapped inside a cavity, either by an external trap,
provided, for instance, by optical tweezers [18] (figure 1(a)), or by self-trapping using two cavity
modes (see appendix D for details). The trap is harmonic, so that the center-of-mass effectively
decouples from any relative degree of freedom. Along the cavity axis, this requires the size
of the object to be smaller than the optical wavelength that is used for trapping and cooling.

creation (annihilation) phonon operators, and z m = (h¯ /2Mωt ) is the ground state size, with
ωt the trap frequency. The resonance frequency of the optical cavity ωc0 is modified by the
presence of the dielectric object inside the cavity. A crucial relation is the frequency dependence
on the position of the dielectric object, which can be estimated using perturbation theory
(see appendix A). This position dependence gives rise to the typical quantum optomechanical

Figure 1. Quantum optomechanics with dielectric objects trapped inside a high-

finesse optical cavity. (a) A dielectric sphere is trapped by optical tweezers inside
a high-finesse optical cavity. The confinement of the center-of-mass motion
along the z-axis is harmonic with frequency ωt . The driving field generates
a radiation pressure able to cool down the mechanical motion to the ground
state. (b) Experimental set-up for the trapping and cooling of dielectric spheres
using two lasers, one for the driving and one for the trapping. (c) The centerof-mass motion of a dielectric rod can also be trapped and cooled. In this case
we assume self-trapping achieved by using two laser modes, see appendix D.

number of photons inside the cavity and g0 = z m ξ0 (ξ0 comes from the resonance frequency
√
dependence on the position, see appendix E). The enhancement of g0 by a factor of n ph has
been used experimentally to achieve the strong coupling regime in recent experiments with
cantilevers [10, 19, 20]. Finally, the total Hamiltonian also includes the mechanical and radiation
energy terms as well as the driving of the cavity. See appendix B for details of these terms as
well as the derivation of equation (1).
Besides the coherent dynamics given by the total Hamiltonian, there exists also a
dissipative part provided by the losses of photons inside the cavity, parametrized by the
decaying rate κ, and the heating to the motion of the dielectric object. Remarkably, our
objects are trapped without linking the object to other mechanical pieces, and hence thermal
transfer does not contribute to the mechanical damping γ . This fact constitutes a distinctive
feature of our proposal, possibly yielding extremely high mechanical quality factors. We have
investigated in detail the most important sources of decoherence (see appendix F). Firstly,
heating due to coupling with other modes, which have very high frequencies, is negligible
when having a quadratic potential. Secondly, the maximum pressure required for ground state
cooling is ∼ 10−6 torr, which actually corresponds to the typical one used in optomechanical
experiments [13]. The mechanical quality factor of our objects under this pressure is ∼ 109 ,

and it can be even increased in a higher vacuum. Thirdly, blackbody radiation does not yield a
loss of coherence due to ‘which-path’ information at room temperature and even much higher
temperatures [1, 21]. Fourthly, light scattering decreases the finesse of the cavity and produces
heat. This sets an upper bound for the size of the objects in the current set-up to be smaller than
the optical wavelength. Fifthly, the bulk temperature of the object remains close to the room
temperature for sufficiently transparent objects at the optical wavelength, a fact that prevents its
damage.
The rotational cooling of cylindrical objects, such as rods (see figure 1(c)), can also be
considered. In this case, two counter-rotating LG modes can be employed to create a standing
wave in the azimuthal angle φ, as illustrated in figure 1(d). The optomechanical coupling
is then given by g0 = (h¯ /2I ωt )ξ0 , where I is the moment of inertia. Using two modes, one
can self-trap both the rotational and the center-of-mass translational motion, and cool either
degree of freedom by slightly varying the configuration of the two modes (see appendix E for
further details). Both degrees of motion can be simultaneously cooled if the trapping is provided
externally (see [22] for a proposal to cool the rotational motion of a mirror and [23] for a recent
optomechanical experiment that uses a non-levitating nanorod).
Regarding the feasibility of our scheme, we require the good cavity regime ωt > κ in order
to accomplish ground state cooling [9]–[11]. Moreover, the strong coupling regime g κ, γ
is also required for quantum states generation. Both regimes can be attained with realistic
experimental parameters using dielectric spheres and rods. In particular, if one considers fused
silica spheres of radius 250 nm in a cavity with finesse 105 and length 4 mm, one can obtain
g ∼ κ ≈ 2π × 180 kHz, and ωt ≈ 2π × 350 kHz. See appendix H for further details.
We tackle now the intriguing possibility to observe quantum phenomena with macroscopic
objects. Notably, the optomechanical coupling equation (1) is of the same nature as the typical
light–matter interface Hamiltonian in atomic ensembles [2]. Hence, the same techniques can be
applied to generate entanglement between Gaussian states of different dielectric objects.
A more challenging step is the preparation of non-Gaussian states, such as the paradigmatic
quantum superposition state
1
| = √ (|0 + |1 ) .
(2)
2
Here |0 (|1 ) is the ground state (first excited state) of the quantum harmonic oscillator. In
the following, we sketch a protocol to create the state equation (2) —see appendix C for
further details. The pivotal idea is to impinge the cavity with a single-photon state, as a
result of parametric down conversion followed by a detection of a single photon [24]. When
impinging into the cavity, part of the field will be reflected and part transmitted [25]. In the
presence of the red-detuned laser, the coupling equation (1) swaps the state of light inside the
cavity to the mechanical motional state, yielding the entangled state |E ab ∼ |0˜ a |1 b + |1˜ a |0 b .

Here a (b) stands for the reflected cavity field (mechanical motion) system, and |0(
displaced vacuum (one photon) light state in the output mode of the cavity. The protocol ends
by performing a balanced homodyne measurement and by switching off the driving field. The
motional state collapses into the superposition state | = c0 |0 + c1 |1 , where the coefficients
c0(1) depend on the measurement result. See figure 2 for the experimental set-up and the results
derived in appendix C. This state can be detected by either transferring it back to a new
driving field and then performing tomography on the output field, or by monitoring the quantum
mechanical oscillation caused by the harmonic trap. Moreover, the amplitude of the oscillation

set-up for implementing the protocol to prepare the quantum superposition state
equation (2). In the figure PDC stands for parametric down conversion and DM

One is detected and the other impinges onto the cavity. If it is reflected, the
one photon pulse on top of the driving field goes back through the PDC (which
is transparent) and is then reflected downwards toward the homodyne detector
by the DM. (b) Mean number of phonons bˆ I† bˆ I imprinted to the mechanical

A Gaussian pulse of width σ = 5.6 κ is used. The red solid line corresponds
to the strong coupling regime g = κ, whereas the blue dashed one corresponds
to the weak coupling g/κ = 1/4. In the strong coupling regime, the balanced
homodyne measurement should be performed around the time where the mean
number of phonons is maximum. This results in the preparation of the quantum
superposition state equation (2).
can be amplified by driving a blue-detuned field tuned to the upper motional sideband (see
appendix C).
A possible extension of the protocol is to impinge the cavity with other non-Gaussian states,
such as the NOON state or the Schrödinger’s cat state |α + | − α [26], where |α is a coherent
state with phase α, in order to create other quantum superposition states. Furthermore, one can
change the laser intensity dynamically to obtain a perfect transmission and avoid the balancedhomodyne measurement; any quantum state of light could be directly mapped to the mechanical
system by the time-dependent interaction. Alternatively, one can tune the laser intensity to the
upper motional sideband, so that a two-mode squeezing interaction is obtained in the cavity.

Figure 3. Quantum superposition of living organisms. Illustration of the protocol

to create quantum superposition states applied to living organisms, such as
viruses, trapped in a high-finesse optical cavity by optical tweezers.
In the bad-cavity limit (relaxing the strong coupling condition) one can use the entanglement
between the output mode and the mechanical system to teleport non-Gaussian states (Oriol
Romero-Isart et al, manuscript in preparation).
In the following, we analyze the possibility of performing the proposed experiment with
living organisms. The viability of this perspective is supported by the following: (i) living
microorganisms behave as dielectric objects, as shown in optical manipulation experiments
in liquids [8]; (ii) some microogranisms exhibit very high resistance to extreme conditions
and, in particular, to the vacuum required in quantum optomechanical experiments [7]; (iii)
the size of some of the smallest living organisms, such as spores and viruses, is comparable
to the laser wavelength, as required in the theoretical framework presented in this work; and
(iv) some of them present a transparency window (which prevents the damage caused by the
laser’s heating) and still have a sufficiently high refractive index. As an example, common
influenza viruses, with a size of ∼ 100 nm, can be stored for several weeks in vacuum down
to 10−4 torr [27]. In higher vacuum, up to 10−6 torr, a good viability can be foreseen for
optomechanics experiments. Due to their structure (e.g. lipid bilayer, nucleocapsid protein and
DNA), viruses present a transparency window at the optical wavelength which yields relatively
low bulk temperatures [28]. Note that self-trapping or alternative trapping methods, such as
magnetic traps, could be used in order to employ lower laser powers. The tobacco mosaic virus
(TMV) also presents very good resistance to high vacuum [7], and has a rod-like appearance of
50 nm width and almost 1 µm length. Therefore, it constitutes the perfect living candidate for
rotational cooling, see figure 1(d).
In conclusion, we have presented results that open up the possibility of observing genuine
quantum effects, such as the creation of quantum superposition states, with nano-dielectric
objects and, in particular, with living organisms such as viruses, see figure 3. This entails the
possibility of testing quantum mechanics, not only with macroscopic objects but also with living

organisms. A direction to be explored is extension to objects larger than the wavelength (Oriol
Romero-Isart et al in preparation). This would permit us to bring larger and more complex living
organisms to the quantum realm, for instance, the Tardigrade, which have a size ranging from
100 µm to 1.5 mm [29] and is known to survive for several days in open space [30]. We expect
the proposed experiments to be a first step in addressing fundamental questions experimentally,
such as the role of life and consciousness in quantum mechanics, and perhaps even implications
for our interpretations of quantum mechanics [31].

Appendix A. Resonance frequency dependence on mechanical position

Here we show how to estimate the frequency dependence on the mechanical coordinates of
arbitrarily shaped dielectric objects. Note that the resonance frequency ωc0 , and the optical mode
ϕ0 (r ) of the cavity without the dielectric object, are known solutions of the Helmholtz equation.
The presence of the dielectric object, which is small compared to the cavity length, can be
considered as a tiny perturbation on the whole dielectric present inside the cavity and, thus,
a perturbation theory can be used to estimate the resonance frequency

Here r is the relative dielectric constant of the object and V (q) is its volume at coordinates q.
The integral in the numerator, which is performed through the volume of the object placed at
coordinates q, yields the frequency dependence on q.

The total Hamiltonian in quantum optomechanics can be typically written as

Note that one obtains that the optomechanical coupling is g = |α|g0 , with g0 = qm ξ0 . Note that
the large term |α|, which is typically of the order of 104 , compensates for the small ground state
size qm .
Appendix C. Protocol to create quantum superposition states

Let us derive here the protocol to create quantum superposition phononic states of the type
equation (2). We use the quantum Langevin equations and the input–output formalism. After
going to the rotating frame with the laser frequency ωL , which is detuned to the resonance
frequency by = ωc − ωL , displacing the photonic and phononic operators aˆ = α + aˆ , bˆ =
β + bˆ (we will omit the prime sign hereafter), choosing α ≈ E/(i + κ) and β ≈ g0 |α|2 /ωt ,
so that the constant terms cancel, and neglecting subdominant terms, one obtains the quantum
Langevin equation for the total Hamiltonian Hˆ t

(C.4)

Next, we consider that the input for the photonic state is a light pulse with Gaussian shape
centered at the resonance frequency ωc , that is,
|ψ =

(C.5)

where aˆ in† (ω, L) (aˆ in (ω, L)) are creation (annihilation) photonic operators out of the cavity at
a distance L and with frequency ω, and φ(ω)√
∝ exp[−(ω − ωc )2 /σ 2 ]. Then, by recalling that
−iωt

the differential equations and obtaining bˆ I† (t), one can compute bˆ I (t) (which is trivially zero
since aˆ in (t) = bˆ in (t) = 0) and bˆ I† (t)bˆ I (t) . The quantity bˆ I† (t)bˆ I (t) is plotted in figure 2(b),
for g/κ = 1 and g/κ = 1/4, with σ = 5.6 κ, γ ∼ 0, and L = 5/κ. One can choose the width of
the pulse so that half of the one-photon pulse enters the cavity. Therefore, at some particular
time t the entangled state
1
|E ab ∼ √ (|0˜ a |1 b + |1˜ a |0 b )
(C.6)

is prepared. Here, |0˜ a (|1˜ a ) is the displaced vacuum (displaced one photon) state of
the light system corresponding to the output field. This state yields bˆ I (t ) = 0 and
bˆ I† (t )bˆ I (t ) = 1/2, as obtained in figure 2(b). The protocol finishes by performing the
balanced homodyne measurement of the quadrature Xˆ L (t) = (A† (t) + A(t)) at time t . Here

switched off.
Note that the distinguishability of the two orthogonal displaced states |0˜ ± |1˜ is exactly
the same as for the non-displaced ones |0 ± |1 . However, the displacement of the output mode
is of the order of |α| in the regime κ ∼ g. This value, which is ∼ 104 with the parameters
proposed here, poses a challenge to the current precision of balanced homodyne detectors. This
experimental challenge can be overcome by using alternative protocols (Oriol Romero-Isart
et al, manuscript in preparation). For instance, one can use a perfect transmission protocol
that consists in using a time modulation of the optomechanical coupling g(t), which can be
implemented by varying the driving intensity, to perfectly transmit a particular light state inside
the cavity. Then, the beam-splitter interaction, given by the red-detuned driving field, perfectly
transmits the input light state sent on top of the driving field to the mechanical system. A key
feature of this protocol is that the balanced homodyne measurement is not required.
C.1. Detection by amplification of the oscillation
√
Let us assume that the state (|0 + |1 )/ 2 has been prepared in the mechanical system. The
mean value of the position, in a harmonic trap, will oscillate with a frequency ωt and amplitude
proportional to the ground state size qm . A coherent state would also oscillate with the same
frequency. In order to distinguish both states, one could measure the fluctuations of the position,
which for the superposition state will oscillate on time, whereas it will remain constant for the
coherent state. This signal could be detected more easily by amplifying it by driving the cavity
with a blue-detuned laser. One can find that the mean value of the position q(t)
ˆ
under the
influence of the two-mode squeezing interaction is given by
q(t)
ˆ
= qm µ(t) cos(ωt t),

(C.8)

where µ(t) = e−κt/2 (cosh(χ t) + κsinh(χ t)/2χ), with χ = g 2 + κ 2 /4 being a function that
increases exponentially with t and therefore amplifies the oscillation.

Appendix D. Self-trapping using two modes

Self-trapping consists in using two optical modes aˆ 1(2) and combining them so that they provide
trapping as well as optomechanical coupling (in [32], this configuration is also discussed in the
context of optomechanics with cold atoms). The initial Hamiltonian in this case would be

In the displaced frame, aˆ 1(2) = α1(2) + aˆ 1(2) (we omit the primer hereafter), where |α1(2) | is the
square root of the number of photons for the mode 1(2). Then, by expanding the resonance
frequency up to the second order around q = 0, i.e. ωc,1(2) (q) = ωc,1(2) + ωc,1(2) q + ω c,1(2) q 2 /2,
fixing the key condition |α1 |2 ωc,1 = −|α2 |2 ωc,2 , and neglecting subdominant terms, one obtains

We have defined ωt = [h¯ (ω c,1 |α1 | + ω c,2 |α2 |2 )/m]1/2 and ξi = ωi αi . Thus, provided that
ω c,1 |α1 |2 + ω c,2 |α2 |2 > 0, one has the desired self-trapping and optomechanical coupling with
the help of the two modes.

Appendix E. Optomechanical coupling and trapping

We compute here the optomechanical coupling for the sphere, assuming external trapping,
and for the rod using self-trapping. In the latter, we derive two configurations required for
cooling either the center-of-mass translational motion or the rotational motion. We will use
the resonance frequency dependence estimated in equation (A.1).
E.1. Dielectric sphere
Let us consider the case of having a dielectric sphere of volume V and relative dielectric
constant r , and a TEM 00 mode in the cavity. Then, the dependence of the resonance frequency
on the center-of-mass position r = (x, y, z), which can be estimated using equation (A.1), is
given by

Here W is the waist of the
√ laser at the center of the cavity and d the cavity length. We consider
a confocal cavity, W = λd/2π . The object is assumed to be placed close to the center of the
cavity and it is assumed that the radius of the sphere is smaller than the laser waist.
We suppose external trapping at x0 = y0 = 0 and z 0 = cπ/4ωc0 , with
√ frequency ωt , see
equation (E.3). Then, the optomechanical coupling is given by g0 = h¯ /2ρV ωt ξ0 , where
ξ0 = ∂z ωc (r )|0 can be computed using equation (E.1) and reads

The shifted frequency is ωc = ωc (r0 ) = ωc0 + δ, with δ = −V ωc0 ( r − 1)/2dπ W 2 .

E.2. Dielectric rod
When considering a rod, in order to simplify the calculation, we model it as two opposed
‘pieces of cake’ of width a, arc L and radius R, see figure E.1. Note that this corresponds
to a small section of the waist of the laser, since we will take R = W/2. The volume of the rod
is V = R La, and its momentum of inertia I = R L M/4π , where M is its mass. In the case of
having a counterrotating LG modes 10 and −10, the frequency dependence on the rotational
angle φ and center-of-mass z position (see figures 1(c) and (d) in the present paper) is given by

with C1 = 2 2 e − 3 / e. In case of having a superposition of the LG modes 20 and −20,

with C2 = 8 e − 13 /2 e. The rod is assumed to be placed close to the center of the cavity
and it is assumed that its width a is much smaller than the cavity length.
We propose the self-trapping configuration (see appendix D) in order to trap both center-ofmass translation and rotation, using, as before, the superposition of LG modes 10 and −10 for
mode-1, and the superposition 20 and −20 for mode-2.
In case of aiming at cooling the translational motion, the equilibrium position is obtained
at φ0 = 0 and z 0 = cπ/8ωc0 , by translating mode-1 a distance z 0 = cπ/4ωc0 with respect to

mode-2. Then, using equations (E.4) and (E.5), one can compute the z-optomechanical coupling
g0z = h¯ /2ρV ωt,z ξ0z , with ξ0z = ∂z ωc,1 (φ, z)|0 , which reads
ξ0z = −

(E.6)

One also has that g0φ = 0. The trapping frequency for the translation along the z-axis,

( r − 1)C1(2) cos2 (π/8)/dπ W 2 .
In case of cooling the rotational motion, the equilibrium position is obtained at φ0 = 7π/12
and z 0 = 0 by rotating mode-1 an angle π/4 with respect to mode-2. Then, one can compute the
φ-optomechanical coupling g0φ = h¯ /2I ωt,φ ξ0φ = ∂φ ωc,1 (φ, z)|0 , which reads

Also, g0z = 0. The trapping frequencies can be computed as in the translational motion coupling,
but at the equilibrium position used for rotational cooling. The shifted frequency is in this case
ωc,1(2) = ωc,1(2) (φ0 , z 0 ) = ωc0 + δ1(2) , with δ1(2) = −3V ωc0 ( r − 1)C1(2) /4dπ W 2 .
Finally, let us mention that by a trapping provided externally, for instance, by means of
optical tweezers, one could place the rod at the maximum slope of both the translational and
azimuthal standing waves. Then, one would obtain g0φ = 0 and g0z = 0 at the same time, and
hence, one could cool both degrees of freedom simultaneously provided that the trapping is
tight enough.
Appendix F. Heating and decoherence due to gas pressure

F.1. Heating rate and mechanical damping
Let us analyze here the heating and damping of the mechanical motion of the center-of-mass
of a dielectric sphere due to the impact of air molecules
inside the vacuum chamber. The air
√
molecules of mass m have mean velocity v¯ = 3K b T /m, where T is the temperature of the
chamber, assumed to be at room temperature, and K b is the Boltzmann constant. The pressure
inside the vacuum chamber is P, and the dielectric sphere has mass M and radius R and is
harmonically trapped with frequency ωt .
One can, hence, consider the Harmonic oscillator with additive white noise:
z¨ + 2γ z˙ + ωt2 z = ξ(t).

(F.1)

The stochastic force ξ(t) describes the impact of air molecules. For white noise, one has
that ξ(t)ξ(t ) = 2M 2 Dδ(t − t ) = 4K b T Mγ δ(t − t ) (thus D = 2K b T γ /M), where in the last
equation we have used the fluctuation dissipation theorem. The variance of the position can
be computed solving the differential stochastic equation and supposing that ω γ (always
fulfilled in our levitating spheres), one obtains
D
[z(t) − z(t) ]2 ≈
1 − e−2γ t .
(F.2)
2γ ω2
By considering the equipartition principle, the variance allows us to compute the increase of
energy by taking E(t) = Mω2 [z(t) − z(t) ]2 . Hence one can compute the time t required

13
to increment one quantum h¯ ω of energy in the quantum harmonic oscillator. This time should
be larger than the inverse of the laser cooling rate , which is defined as the time required to
decrease one quantum of energy. The time t is given by solving E(t ) = h¯ ω and reads

We determine now an expression for γ that will depend on the properties of the gas surrounding
the harmonic oscillator. We will derive it through kinetic theory. Assume that our sphere is
moving with velocity v. At the reference frame where the sphere has velocity equal to zero, one
can compute the decrease of momentum of the sphere by the balance of momenta, given by the
impact of one third of the particles colliding from behind with a velocity v¯ − v , minus those
colliding in front with velocity v + v¯ . This can be written as

8 m v¯ π R 2
We have used the spheres described in appendix H, and the fact that the mass of molecules of air
is m ∼ 28.6 u and T = 300 K. Recalling that the typical cooling rate is of the order of hundreds
of kHz [9]–[11], one obtains the typical pressures of order 10−6 torr used in experiments. With
this pressure we have a damping of the order of mHz, which leads to extremely good mechanical
quality factors of the order of 109 .
F.2. Decoherence of the superposition state
The same process of heating due to collisions of air molecules causes decoherence of a
superposition state. Following [33], the relevant quantity is the localization rate
3 m v¯ P

where we take the effective cross section as π R 2 . This describes the decoherence ρ(x, x , t) =
ρ(x, x , 0) exp[− t (x − x )2 ] due to scattering of air molecules. In the case of having the
superposition state |0 + |1 of√the harmonic oscillator, the decoherence rate would be then given
by dec = z m2 , where z m = h¯ /2Mωt is the ground state size. Recall that the heating rate is
¯ ωt , where γ = 4π R 2 P/M v¯ . Hence, using the expression of γ , one has
+ = 1/t = K b T 2γ /h
that dec / + ≈ 1, as it was to be expected for our harmonic oscillator.

Appendix G. Bulk temperature

In order to estimate the bulk temperature of the dielectric object attained after being heated by
the lasers, we assume that it behaves as a blackbody. Then, the steady state of the dielectric
objects fulfills that the power absorbed

Pabs =
|E| [α],

where ωL is the laser frequency, E the electric field, and α the polarizability, equals the power
dissipated Prad through blackbody radiation

Prad = Aeσ T 4 − Tenv
,

(G.2)

where A is the area of the object, e the emissivity (≈ 1), σ the Stefan–Boltzmann constant, Tenv
the temperature of the vacuum chamber, and T the bulk temperature. Thus, from Pabs = Prad
one obtains the bulk temperature T . For a sphere of radius R trapped by optical tweezers, this
corresponds to

(G.3)

where P is the laser power and r = 1 + i 2 the complex relative dielectric constant. Note that
only here we have assumed r to be complex, since 2 is generally very small for the objects we
consider.
Appendix H. Experimental parameters for strong coupling and ground state cooling of
dielectric spheres and rods

We consider a confocal cavity of length d = 4 mm,
√ with a resonant laser at λ = 1064 nm, which
gives a waist at the center of the cavity of W = λd/2π ≈ 26.0 µm. If we assume a high-finesse
optical cavity with F = 105 , then the decaying rate is κ = cπ/2F d = 2π × 188 kHz. The
presence of the sphere scatters photons out of the cavity and produces heat. A rough estimation,
assuming that the total cross section is given by πR 2 , sets an upper bound F = π W 2 /πR 2 105
for the radius of spheres of ∼ 80 nm. A more rigorous calculation, using Mie theory, sets up
the upper bound to ∼ 250 nm (see Oriol Romero-Isarf et al in preparation where the effect of
scattering of photons is studied in detail).
The dielectric objects are considered to be made of fused silica, with a density ρ =
2201 kg m−3 and relative dielectric constant r = 2.1. We take spheres of radius 250 nm, and
rods with length equal to the waist W , width a = 50 nm and arc length L = 50 nm.
Using a laser of 1064 nm, and a ratio I0 /W02 = 2 W µm−4 , one has that the trapping
frequency of the center-of-mass translation for the dielectric sphere provided by the optical
tweezers is ωt = 2π × 351 kHz (see equation (E.3)). Hence, κ/ωt ∼ 0.53 places us well in
the good cavity regime required for ground state cooling. On the other hand, the enhanced
optomechanical coupling, with laser powers of 0.5 mW, gives g = 2π × 182 kHz, which also
places us in the strong coupling regime g κ, γ .
Regarding the dielectric rod, for the translational motion cooling scheme, we achieve
trapping frequencies of ωt,z = 2π × 552 kHz and ωt,φ = 2π × 848 kHz, and optomechanical
coupling of gz = 2π × 243 kHz. For the rotational cooling, one has trapping frequencies
ωt,z = 2π × 492 kHz, ωt,φ = 2π × 503 kHz, and optomechanical coupling gφ = 2π × 276 kHz.

We assumed driving powers for mode-1 of 4 mW. In both cases, one gets the good cavity and
strong coupling regimes.
Optical grade fused silica presents very low absorption at 1064 nm, with 1 = 2.1 and
=
2.5 × 10−10 . In these experimental conditions, the bulk temperature achieved for the
2
dielectric spheres is estimated to be just around four degrees above the room temperature when
using the optical tweezers.
