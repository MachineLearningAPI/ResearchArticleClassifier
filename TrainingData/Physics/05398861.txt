Handling Sideband Radiations in Time-Modulated Arrays
Through Particle Swarm Optimization
Lorenzo Poli, Paolo Rocca, Luca Manica, and Andrea Massa

Abstract—The minimization of the power losses in time-modulated arrays is addressed by means of a suitable strategy based on particle swarm
optimization. By properly modifying the modulation sequence, the method
is aimed at reducing the amount of wasted power, analytically computed
through a very effective closed-form relationship, while constraining the
radiation pattern at the carrier frequency below a fixed sidelobe level. Representative results are reported and compared with previously published
solutions to assess the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

I. INTRODUCTION
The use of time as an additional degree of freedom in array synthesis
has been investigated in the pioneering work by Shanks and Bickmore
[1]. Kummer et al. in [2] discussed the possibility of using RF switches
for modulating in time the element excitations in order to obtain average low and ultra-low side lobes. Successively, only a few works (e.g.,
[3]) have dealt with time modulation. As pointed out in [2], [4], the
main difficulties to the diffusion of such a technique lie in its technical
implementation. However, some recent prototypes [5], [6] and new interesting applications (e.g., the synthesis of sum and difference patterns
[7] or the realization of phase switched screens [6]) have renewed the
interest on time-modulated arrays as well as on its practical feasibility.
By a theoretical point of view, the modulation of the array excitations with RF switches generates undesired harmonic radiations and
power losses. In order to reduce sideband radiations (SRs), different
stochastic iterative algorithms have been proposed [5], [8]–[10]. They
are based on the minimization of the sideband levels (SBLs) at the
higher order harmonics. However, such a guideline presents some disadvantages. First, it enforces an “indirect” SRs reduction (i.e., through
SBLs minimization). Moreover, it needs the computation of the SBL
at each harmonic frequency. As a matter of fact, neglecting some higher
harmonics and considering just low orders could prevent a suitable SR
reduction. In order to overcome these drawbacks, this communication
presents an innovative approach based on a Particle Swarm Optimizer
(PSO ) [11] aimed at synthesizing a desired pattern with a prescribed
sidelobe level (SLL) at the carrier frequency also directly minimizing
the power losses due to SRs. Towards this end, the closed-form relationship, derived in [4] to quantify the total power wasted in sideband
radiations, is profitably exploited because of its analytic form, its simplicity, and to avoid the evaluation of the (infinite) set of higher harmonic patterns.
The outline of the communication is as follows. In Section II, the
key-issues concerned with time-modulation for the array synthesis
are briefly summarized. Successively, the PSO -based strategy for the

reduction of the power losses due to SRs is described. Section III is
devoted to the numerical analysis. Preliminary results are reported
and compared with state-ofthe-art solutions to point out the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Finally, some conclusions are drawn
(Section IV).
II. MATHEMATICAL FORMULATION

Let us consider a time-modulated linear array of N (without loss of
generality) isotropic elements located at zn = nd, n = 0; . . . ; N 0
1, (d being the inter-element distance) along the z axis. The corresponding array factor is given by [2]
N 01
F (; t) = ej! t In (t)ejnu
(1)
n=0

where !0 = 2f0 is the carrier angular frequency, u = (!0 =c)d cos  ,
c being the speed of light in vacuum, and  the angle measured from
the array axis. Moreover, In (t) = n Un (t), n = 0; . . . ; N 0 1, are
the time-modulated excitations. More specifically,  = fn ; n =
0; . . . ; N 0 1g and U (t) = fUn (t); n = 0; . . . ; N 0 1g are the
set of static excitations and time-step functions of the RF switches,

respectively.
Because of the periodicity of the pulse sequences, Un (t) = Un (t +
iTp ), n = 0; . . . ; N 0 1, i 2 ,

By substituting (3) in (1), the far field pattern radiated by the array
appears to be the summation of an infinite number of harmonic contributions. More specifically, the central frequency beam is given by

Therefore, it turns out that the SR power losses can be minimized by
properly setting the values of the static excitations, , as well as the durations of the time pulses,  . However, since we are interested in synthesizing antennas with a low number of control parameters, uniform and
isophoric excitations (i.e., n = 1, n = 0; . . . ; N 0 1) are assumed.
Only the durations of the switch-on times are then optimized by means
of an iterative (k being the iteration index) P SO -based strategy aimed
at minimizing the following cost function

Moreover, wSLL and wP are real weight coefficients and H (1) is the

As regards to the P SO -based minimization, the algorithm starts
from randomly chosen guess values and updates at each iteration the

where e (inertial weight), C1 (cognitive acceleration), and C2 (social acceleration) are the P SO control parameters. Moreover, r1 and

III. NUMERICAL RESULTS
This section is devoted to give some indications on the effectiveness
of the proposed approach in minimizing the power losses associated
to the SRs, while synthesizing a fixed-SLL pattern at the carrier frequency. Towards this purpose, some representative examples are reported and discussed also in a comparative fashion. Comments on the
relationship between SR minimization, performance (i.e., SLL) and
complexity of the synthesized array are given, as well.
Let us consider a linear array of N = 30 elements equally-spaced
by d = 0:7. The same experiment has been previously dealt with in
[10] with the aim of minimizing the sideband levels (SBLs) at h = 1,
2, while keeping a desired SLL at ! = !0 . In [10], the optimization has been carried out by means of a Simulated Annealing (SA)
approach by setting SLLref = 020 dB and SBLref = 030 dB,
respectively. The synthesized solution [10] fulfills both requirements

N = 30 d = 0:7
(h = 0)

(i.e., SLLSA = 020 dB, SBLSA = 030:2 dB, and SBLSA =

SR = 3:89% of the total
wasted in the sidelobe radiations amounts to PSA
input power. The directivity and the feed-network efficiency computed
T = 15:14 dB and
through the relationships in [12] are equal to DSA
f
SA = 0:82, respectively.
As far as the P SO -based method is concerned, a swarm of S = 10
particles (i.e., trial solutions) has been chosen and the control parameters have been set to w = 0:4, C1 = C2 = 2:0, and K = 1000.
Moreover, a uniform weighting has been assumed in (9) (i.e., wSLL =
wP = 1:0). The numerical simulations have been run on a 3 GHz
PC with 1 GB of RAM and the convergence has been reached after
Kend = 761 iterations with a total and average (per iteration) CP U
time equal 113.39 [sec] and 0.149 [sec], respectively. The time sequence synthesized at k = Kend is shown in Fig. 1 while the patterns
afforded at the carrier frequency [(5)] and the first two harmonic patterns [(6)—h = 1, 2] are shown in Fig. 2. As it can be noticed (Fig. 1),
only 4 elements are time modulated (versus 9 in [10]) and the same performances of the SA-based approach have been obtained neglecting
the elements 1, 26, 27, and 29, which are always turned off.

Finally, Fig. 5 gives some indications on the trade-off between antenna performance (i.e., directivity and SLL) and associated power
losses, P SR , when considering Dolph-Chebyshev distributions [13].
As expected, it is worth noting that there is an inverse relationship between the amount of power losses and the maximum directivity for
time-modulated linear arrays.

As regards to the fulfillment of the synthesis constraints, Fig. 3
opt
shows the behavior of 9opt
k = 9( k ) and the values of the two terms
in (9). As expected, the P SO solution widely fulfils the user constraint on the SLL at the convergence [i.e., 9SLL (Kend ) < 1006 ],
when the stationary condition on the value of the cost function is
reached. Concerning the SR, although the sideband level of the
first harmonic term of the P SO solution is higher than that syn(1)
thesized with the SA approach (i.e., SBLP SO = 028:9 dB vs.
(1)
SBLSA = 030:2 dB—Fig. 4), the amount of power losses in the
SRs turns out to be lower since PPSR
SO = 3:57%. Such a result
points out that a suitable strategy based on the direct minimization
of the SR, instead of the optimization of the SBLs [5], [8]–[10],
seems to be more effective in reducing power losses. On the other
hand, it should be noticed that the proposed techniques also guarantees satisfactory SBLs since, besides the first harmonic (h = 1),
(h)
(h)
SBLP SO < SBLSA for h  2. As a matter of fact, the reduction
of the SBL ranges from a minimum of 1SBL
min = 0:7 dB to a
maximum equal to 1SBL
max = 11:5 dB, with an average value of
= 6:2 dB. Conversely, the directivity as well as the
around 1SBL
av
feed-network efficiency slightly reduce to DPT SO = 14:94 dB and
f
P SO = 0:79.

In this communication, an innovative approach for the synthesis of
time-modulated arrays has been proposed. In order to reduce the power
losses, a P SO -based optimization strategy has been adopted to minimize a closed-form relationship, which takes into account the whole
sideband radiations in a direct way thus avoiding the computationallyexpensive evaluation of the infinite set of harmonic patterns. Thanks to
these key-features, the proposed technique represents an improvement
with respect to state-of-the-art methods in terms of simplicity and efficiency as shown by some representative results.
Further investigations will concern with the extension of the
P SO -based strategy to the synthesis of real-time adaptive systems
suitable for communications as well as for the suppression of jamming
signals.

Abstract—The linear array performance of an ultrawideband (UWB),
coplanar waveguide (CPW) fed, printed, loop antenna is investigated by
means of simulations and measurements. The UWB properties of the array
are demonstrated by synthesizing the array reflection coefficient, starting
from the simulated and measured scattering matrices. The array is proven
fractional impedance bandwidth of 64%, stretching
to have a
between 7 GHz and 13.6 GHz. The performance of a complete, non-scanning, broadside array are examined by feeding the array via a Wilkinson
power divider. The study is completed by radiation pattern measurements
that show stable co-polar and low cross-polar characteristics over the operational bandwidth.

I. INTRODUCTION
UWB technology is regarded as one of the most promising high data
rate technologies. However, there are still challenges in making this
technology live up to its full potential. One of the challenges is the
design of the UWB antennas which have become the topic of continued investigation in the fields of wireless communications, due to
such attractive features as transmitting and/or receiving electromagnetic energy in shorter duration and avoiding both frequency and space
dispersion.
The antennas used for the UWB technology should satisfy certain
specifications. First of all, they should transmit short pulses, meaning
that the antenna must cover a large bandwidth in order to keep the

ringing effects on the transmitted pulse at an acceptable level. Secondly, the input impedance of the antennas should be well matched to
the transmitter and receiver for an efficient power transfer. Ideally, the
pattern and the impedance matching should be stable across the entire
band. In some applications, scanning the beam is required, which is the
particular challenge in the UWB area and, thus, the antenna elements
need being embedded in array environments. In such cases, the grating
lobes free scanning requires the UWB elements to have small electrical
sizes.
Many UWB antenna elements are known in the literature [1]–[6] and
some of them have indeed electrically small sizes. However, their suitability for being employed in (linear) array requires their UWB properties to be maintained when brought in array environments, a topic
that was not clearly elucidated. In this contribution, the performance
of a linear array, the elements of which evolved from the tulip-loop
antenna described in [4], is investigated for the first time. A method
for calculating the array input reflection coefficient by using the simulated and measured scattering matrices of the array is proposed. Detailed array radiation pattern results obtained by both aggregating individual element characteristics and corporate feeding measurements are
also reported. The account now proceeds by introducing the relevant
array. The device’s adequate UWB characteristics are demonstrated in
Section III by a twofold study of the array impedance matching and,
then, in Section IV by reporting radiation pattern measurements. The
work is finalized by drawing some conclusions.
II. INVESTIGATED ARRAY STRUCTURE
The linear array antenna under study employs the tulip-loop antenna
presented in [4]. The individual elements have a width of 11 mm, including the metallic walls enclosing the loop itself. The tulip loop an2 impedance bandwidth of 83%, stretching
tenna has a VSWR
between 6 GHz and 14.5 GHz and stable radiation patterns within its
impedance bandwidth. This antenna is investigated in detail in [4].
In view of studying their behavior in an array environment, the CPW
fed printed loop antennas are assembled in a four elements, linear array
(see Fig. 1). As clearly stated in [4], the employed radiators are characterized by a (practically) omnidirectional radiation in the xOz plane,
recommending this plane for ensuring adequate scannable array operation. Consequently, the results reported in this work concern the
xOz plane, only. For examining the far field radiation properties in
this plane, a polar reference frame is employed, the polar angle #(0
# < 360 ) measuring the trigonometric rotation around the Oy -axis,
with the Oz -axis taken as reference (see Fig. 1). The array antenna has
