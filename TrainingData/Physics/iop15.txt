Abstract. We provide physically intuitive mechanisms for the effect of noise
on excitation energy transfer (EET) in networks. Using these mechanisms of
dephasing-assisted transport (DAT) in a hybrid basis of both excitons and
sites, we develop a detailed picture of how noise enables energy transfer with
efficiencies well above 90% across the Fenna–Matthew–Olson (FMO) complex,
a type of light-harvesting molecule. We demonstrate explicitly how noise alters
the pathways of energy transfer across the complex, suppressing ineffective
pathways and facilitating direct ones to the reaction centre. We explain that
the fundamental mechanisms underpinning DAT are expected to be robust with
respect to the considered noise model but show that the specific details of
the exciton–phonon coupling, which remain largely unknown in these type
of complexes, and in particular the impact of non-Markovian effects, result
in variations of dynamical features that should be amenable to experimental
verification with current or planned technology. A detailed understanding of DAT
in natural compounds could open up a new paradigm of ‘noise-engineering’ by
which EET can be optimized in artificial light-harvesting structures.

1. Introduction

The early stages of natural photosynthesis are able to capture and transport incident light
energy with nearly 100% efficiency, and a clear understanding of these processes could be
immensely valuable for optimizing the efficiency of artificial light-harvesting devices [1].
Ultrafast nonlinear spectroscopy has been used to probe energy transfer dynamics in the
Fenna–Matthew–Olson (FMO) complex [2–4], a crucial part of the photosynthetic system of
green sulfur bacteria. Recently, further experiments at physiological temperatures have been
performed [5]. The FMO complex is an example of a pigment–protein complex (PPC), a
network through which electronic excitations on individual pigments can migrate via excitonic
couplings. It functions as a type of molecular ‘wire’ that funnels light energy captured in the
chlorosome antennae to a reaction centre (RC), where the energy is used to initiate chemical
reactions [6]. These experiments have demonstrated the existence of strong quantum coherences
between multiple pigments, and have shown that the highly efficient energy relaxation in this
system proceeds via coherently delocalized exciton states [2]. In addition, wave-like beating
between these excitons has been observed to persist on timescales > 550 fs, a significant fraction
of the typical transport time in FMO [3].
These observations have generated considerable interest in understanding the possibly
functional role of quantum coherence effects in the remarkably efficient excitation energy
transfer (EET) in FMO and other PPCs. It was initially argued that the fast transfer rates may
be attributed to the exploitation of quantum search algorithms by the quantum dynamics of the
FMO complex [1, 3]. However, typical timescales for relaxation and dephasing in PPCs [7]
suggest that any quantum entanglement will be short ranged, and, as it is generally accepted
that efficient quantum computation requires long-range entanglement [8], the application of
the principles of standard quantum computation in this system is far from straightforward. As a
result, the complete formulation of a possible link between quantum coherence and functionality
is still an open problem [9–12].
Starting with the seminal work of [13–18], EET has been studied within the chemical
physics community for several decades, yet the topic remains timely [19–22] due to the recent
development of new experimental methods and also novel numerical techniques that allow
theoretical models of the, still unknown, system–environment couplings to be tested [23].
Methods and ideas from quantum information science have also recently started to provide a
new and complementary perspective on EET dynamics. Theoretical investigations of the role of

pure dephasing noise in EET have found that this noise has the ability to enhance both the rate
and the yield of EET when compared to perfectly quantum coherent evolution [24, 25]. These
results challenge the traditional view in information processing that noise always degrades
the efficiency of quantum processes, and they demonstrate that controllable noise can even be
considered as an additional engineering tool for tasks such as excitation transport [26].
In the exciton basis normally used in previous studies [27], dephasing-assisted transport
(DAT) is understood as resulting from noise-induced transitions between exciton eigenstates
that cause energetic relaxation of the excitations towards the RC. Though sufficient to suggest
the possible existence of DAT in systems in contact with an uncontrollable environment, this
approach does not currently describe in a transparent way how DAT actually works in detail
and how it might be controlled or used. Such an understanding is essential for the fabrication
of future artificial systems in which unavoidable noise might to some extent be employed as a
constructive element to optimize light harvesting and transport [28, 29].
This paper revises and extends the physically intuitive picture we presented in [9] of how
DAT, and more general noise-assisted transport, operates. It also highlights the engineering
potential of deliberately applying noise in quantum transport networks. Starting with an
idealized and exactly soluble model of noisy network transport, we revisit the underlying
mechanisms that lead to DAT and then proceed to introduce additional complexity into this
model to reveal how these mechanisms work in conjunction. Using these insights, we analyze
simulations of EET in FMO using a hybrid basis that allows a novel and clear visualization
of how these mechanisms operate in this system, and we also make quantitative predictions
about how they can optimize the transport. In essence, it allows us to follow the evolution of the
initial excitation across the molecular ‘wire’ as it makes its way to the RC. The exact nature of
the hybrid basis is governed by the relative magnitudes of the site energies and their couplings
to the neighbouring sites. In fact, it has recently (and independently) been used to explain the
experimentally observed quantum coherences in the photosynthetic apparatus of cryptophyte
algae at room temperature [30]. Finally, we expand upon previous descriptions of DAT in
FMO to consider forms of non-Markovian dephasing and show that, although the fundamental
mechanisms supporting DAT are robust with respect to the considered noise model, observable
dynamical differences do appear that should be amenable to experimental testing. These types of
evidence would be most valuable in discerning the exact nature of the exciton–phonon coupling
in different types of photosynthetic complexes.
2. The network model

Following previous theoretical descriptions of PPCs [22, 24, 25], we consider the PPCs as
networks composed of distinct sites, one of which receives a single initial excitation, while
another is connected to the RC. The network of N sites is described by the coherent hopping
Hamiltonian

where σ j+ = | j 0| and
= |0 j| are raising and lowering operators for site j, the state | j
denotes one excitation in site j and |0 is the zero exciton state. The local site energies are h¯ ω j ,
and v j,l are the coherent tunnelling amplitudes between the sites j and l. We do not assume

any particular form for the microscopic coupling that generates these tunnelling amplitudes
and we therefore treat them as free parameters when considering abstract networks, as we
do in section 3. For the case of the FMO complex, we will use the published Hamiltonian
for Prosthecochloris aestuarii taken from [21], where the hopping parameters are fixed by the
geometry and dipolar structure of the site interactions. We will further assume that the system is
susceptible simultaneously to two distinct types of noise: a radiative decay process that transfers
the excitation energy in site j to the environment (with rate j ), and a pure dephasing process
(with rate γ j ) that destroys the phase coherence of any superposition of localized excitations.
The dynamics of the network’s density matrix is modelled by a Markovian master equation of
the form
ρ(t)
˙ = −i[H, ρ(t)] + Lrad (ρ(t)) + Ldeph (ρ(t)),

where the local radiative and pure dephasing terms are described, respectively, by Lindblad
super-operators Ldeph and Lrad ,

where {A, B} denotes an anticommutator. Formally, this approach is equivalent to the
Haken–Strobl model at infinite temperature [17], where pure dephasing is accounted for in
terms of a classical, fluctuating field. The total excitation transfer is measured by the population
transferred to the RC, modelled as the ‘sink’ node, numbered N + 1, which is populated by an
irreversible decay process (with rate N +1 ) from a site k of the network and described by a
Lindblad operator Lsink (ρ)

which will be used as the key measure of the transport efficiency.
3. The fully connected network (FCN)

We shall show in the next few sections how the combination of inter-site coherence, interference
of tunnelling amplitudes, and energetic disorder can conspire to drive strong DAT. For clarity,
we begin by presenting each mechanism separately in simple network models in which these
effects can be isolated. The first system we will consider is the FCN. The FCN is characterized
by equal hopping strengths between all sites, i.e. h¯ v j,l = J for any j = l, and for the case
of a uniform FCN, i.e. one in which ω j , γ j and j are the same on every site, an exact
analytical solution for the density matrix for arbitrarily large networks can be found [9]. We
first consider such a uniform FCN with γ j = 0, j = 0, and one excitation on site 1. The

= 0, J = 1,
N +1 = 1, for the cases of no dephasing (circles), pure dephasing (squares), static
disorder (triangles) and static disorder with uniform dephasing (star). Destructive
interference in the FCN can also be effectively removed (in the absence of pure
dephasing) by the presence of static disorder in the local site energies or hopping
rates. Such a disorder can prevent the cancellation of tunnelling amplitudes and
thus enhances the asymptotic value of psink . For this case, the site energies are
random numbers drawn uniformly from [0, 1], while the dephasing rates are
chosen to equal 1 for all the sites in the dephasing case. Inset: psink (t) at a fixed
time t = 50 as a function of γ .
only irreversible process left is the decay of population to the sink from site N . In figure 1,
the time evolution of the sink population for these conditions is shown (circles) for the case
of N = 7. This choice is motivated by the fact that the actual FMO complex that we will
analyse in subsequent sections can be modelled as a seven-site network. In the absence of any
noisy process, the asymptotic value of psink is 1/6 and this should be contrasted with classical
hopping for which psink (t → ∞) = 1. The striking difference between these results can be seen
as a consequence of destructive interference of tunnelling amplitudes in the quantum case.
Although individual sites have finite √
amplitudes J for transfer to other sites, a superposition
state of the form | i j = (|i − | j )/ 2 cannot propagate in the network due to the perfect
cancellation of the tunnelling amplitudes from each state in the antisymmetric superposition.
This coherent trapping is illustrated in figure 2(a). Having identified these non-propagating
states, the excitation asymptotically transferred to the sink can be understood as being just
the weight of the initial state that lies outside the ‘invariant subspace’, which consists of all
| i j that have zero tunnelling matrix elements with the localized state |N and therefore do not
feel the presence of the sink. For the case considered here, this insight immediately predicts
psink (∞) = 1/(N − 1), in agreement with the result shown in figure 1. Invariant subspace
analysis of more complex networks and other initial conditions can be found in [9].

Figure 2. A three-site FCN. In (a), destructive interference of the tunnelling

amplitudes from each site in an antisymmetric eigenstate prevents transfer
to the sink site (blue). In (b), an energy mismatch generates an asymmetric
stationary state, which is coupled to the sink and leads to transport. In (c), local
dephasing efficiently removes destructive interference effects and generally leads
to excitation transfer to the sink at a faster timescale than mere energy disorder.
Purely coherent dynamics can thus impede transport in multiply connected networks
via interference, but, in the presence of dephasing noise, trapped excitations can become
propagating, as shown in figure 2(c). This is the first physical mechanism of DAT: the removal of
transport-suppressing interference effects. Figure 1 shows that, as the dephasing noise strength
γ increases, the efficiency rapidly rises to near-perfect excitation transfer as the phase coherence
of the | i j states is destroyed. With further increase in γ , the efficiency drops as noise
suppresses tunnelling via the quantum Zeno effect, as shown in the inset of figure 1. We thus find
an optimum dephasing strength where the combination of coherent tunnelling and dephasing
maximizes the transport efficiency, a generic feature of networks that display DAT, as we will
discuss again in the context of the FMO dynamics. This coherent trapping and DAT are related
to the type of ‘dark states’ found in quantum dot and optical systems [31–33]. If we allow
in our model for site energies to become disordered, another mechanism of DAT appears:
line broadening. Random energetic disorder removes the destructive interference discussed
above, and formally leads to psink (∞) = 1 in the absence of noise. Note, however, the different
timescale of the process, as illustrated by the triangles sequence in figure 1. If the energy
difference between sites is much greater than their coherent couplings, the energy eigenstates
are effectively localized, and coherent transport between these sites is strongly suppressed. Thus
EET times may be very long and excitations may decay before reaching the target [9]. However,
pure dephasing causes spectral broadening of the site energies, and, if it is sufficiently strong to
cause overlap of site energies, additional incoherent tunnelling between sites can be activated,
leading to an increase in EET efficiency, as shown in figure 1 (stars). Line broadening is also
the basis for the Forster mechanism, which is frequently used to study EET in chromophoric
systems and has been well understood for some time [13].
It is important to note that highly efficient DAT is not simply achieved by using noise to
drive the dynamics into a purely classical regime; rather it is a combination of both noise and

bring the |+ state into resonance with site 3 leading to fast transport. The |− is

coherence, which places the system at the boundary between quantum and classical physics,
thus making DAT much more efficient than purely coherent dynamics. This interplay and its
possible use for optimizing transport efficiencies can be simply illustrated using a hybridized
basis set to look at a slightly non-uniform three-level FCN with couplings v13 = v23 and site
energies
ω1 = ω2 = ω3 . Expressing the FCN Hamiltonian in the basis {|+ , |− , |3 }, where
√
2|± = |1 ± |2 , leads to the new level and coupling structure shown in figure 3. This figure
shows how the system can exploit coherence to alter the energy landscape via the coherent
splitting of the |± states and also to change the hopping matrix elements between states. In this
example, the inter-site coherence can be chosen to create a highly efficient transport pathway to
the sink by bringing the |+ state into resonance with |3 and enhancing the tunnelling amplitude.
However, the other state becomes decoupled from site 3 due to larger energy mismatch and,
in this particular case, cancellation of tunnelling matrix elements. Population in this state is
decoupled from the sink. Now, adding noise to the system dephases superpositions of localized
states |i , and in the hybrid basis this opens an incoherent transition between |− and |+ . When
noise is weak enough to preserve the coherent level structure for sufficiently long times, the
population initially in |− can therefore also take advantage of the fast resonant |+ → |3
transfer, leading to a large DAT effect.
4. Light-harvesting molecules (the FMO complex)

Having presented some underlying mechanisms of noise-assisted EET in the FCN models,
we now investigate in detail how they operate in the FMO complex [6]. The FMO complex
is a trimer of three identical units, each composed of seven bacteriochlorophyll a molecules

(green lines), and the coherent interactions that dominate the dynamics in the
absence of noise are labelled (I)–(III). For FMO, site 3 is coupled directly to
the sink. The most important new transport pathway arising from the presence
of noise is labelled (IV). (a) Population in |+ decays quickly into the sink due
to nearly resonant coherent interaction with site 3. (b) Coherent coupling of |−

Resonant coherent coupling causes strong population oscillations between |−
and sites 5–7, inhibiting transfer to the sink in the absence of noise. This pathway
is suppressed by dephasing and enhances transport. (d) In the hybrid basis, a

population of the |− state to decay into the |+ state and then quickly decay into

embedded in a scaffolding of protein molecules. We model the FMO monomer unit as a
seven-site network with coupling strengths and site energies taken from [21]. The typical EET
timescale is known to be of several picoseconds, which is much shorter than the 1 ns typical
radiative lifetime of excitons. The excitation starts on site 1, thought to be the site closest to the
base plate, and site 3 is connected to the RC (sink). Our numbering of the FMO sites follows the
conventional one [6, 21]. The excitation transfer in the FMO complex of P. aestuarii undergoing
completely coherent dynamics is shown by the green line in figure 7 and only reaches 57% over
the typical transfer time of 5 ps. This dephasing-free evolution resembles the FCN case shown
by the sequence of circles in figure 1 and can be explained using a similar picture.
The strong coupling between sites 1 and
√ 2 in the FMO Hamiltonian inspires a hybrid
basis {|+ , |− , |3 . . . |7 }, where |± = 1/ 2(|1 ± |2 ). In this basis, the Hamiltonian has

case (light green line) and the transfer efficiency for the Linbladian noise model

transport is nearly complete within the experimental 5 ps transport time, and
coherent oscillations in the dynamics persist until 1 ps.
√
corresponds to the initial condition 2|1 = |+ + |− . As in the FCN example, the strong
coherent interaction between sites 1 and 2 pushes the |+ state closer in energy to state |3 and,
as shown in figure 4, the population in this state decays quickly into the sink via path (I). Note,
however, that there is a relatively small coherent enhancement or cancellation of the transition
amplitudes between |± and |3 as v13 v23 . The near resonance of the |+ state represents the
dominant contribution to the initial fast rise in psink in the noise-free case, as shown in figure 5.
Once ∼50% of the excitation initially in |+ has decayed, the rise time of psink becomes
much slower as the population initially in |− does not propagate as efficiently into site 3. To
understand this we need to examine the two principal remaining paths, (II) and (III) in figure 4.
The |− state has roughly the same coupling strength to site 3 as the |+ state; however, it is at
a much higher energy. By turning-off all couplings in the Hamiltonian so that only path (II) is
active, we are able to measure the isolated population transfer rate via this path, and find that
it is over an order of magnitude slower than the decay rate via path (I) in the absence of noise.
The second process (path (III) in figure 4) would be obscured in a full site or exciton basis, but
reveals itself very clearly in the hybrid picture. As seen in figure 4, |− is almost resonant with
site 6, and, as a result of constructive interference of the tunnelling amplitudes v16 and v26 , the
effective coupling of |− and |6 is about twice the energy mismatch of these states.
This strongly coupled resonance causes the population held in state |− to oscillate across
the complex between sites 1 and 2 and site 6. Sites 5 and 7, which are strongly coupled to 6,
also participate in these oscillations, and these oscillations are shown in figure 6(a). Direct and
indirect coherent transport from sites 5–7 to the sink are even slower than path (II), and these
oscillations along path (III) dominate the dynamics and effectively prevent this population from

Figure 6. (a) Population of the |− state (red line) and the combined populations

is close to a direct resonance with site 3 and this population decays rapidly. This

rapidly through the incoherent |+ → |3 path described in the text. (d) The
population of the |+ state with optimized dephasing rates. Oscillatory features

decaying into the sink via path (II). To obtain an estimate of the importance of these oscillations,
we compare the average rate of change of psink (t) (after the initial fast decay) for the full FMO
Hamiltonian, and the same Hamiltonian with the coupling between |− and site 6 set to zero.
We find that in the latter case the transfer rate becomes 50% larger than the former case.
The blue line in figure 5 shows the transport obtained with dephasing rates that were
optimized numerically for a transfer time of about 5 ps [9] and which cause psink to increase
to 0.903 over this timescale. This dramatic increase in EET arises primarily from the noiseinduced suppression of pathway (III) in figure 4 and the new noise-induced incoherent transition
between |− and |+ , shown as path (IV) in figure 4. Path (IV) allows the population initially in
the |− state to decay via the fast |+ → |3 path (I). In fact, we find that dephasing on sites 1

and 2 alone is sufficient to drive psink to about 0.85. The remaining improvement in efficiency
in our optimized simulations arises from strong dephasing on sites 3–7. Dephasing on sites 5–7
(along with dephasing on sites 1 and 2) destroys the coherent oscillations that keep the initial
|− population away from the trap in the noiseless case, and the resulting incoherent transitions
along path (III) rapidly redistribute this population equally among states |− and |5 –|7 . Line
broadening due to dephasing on sites 3–7 quickly transfers populations from sites 5–7 to the
sink via sites 4 and 3, and noise on site 3 further enhances the EET rate via line broadening
effects on paths (I) and (II) of figure 4. The suppression of the |− → |6 oscillations and the
stronger decay of the |− population via path (I) of figure 4 are shown in figures 6(c) and
(d). Most importantly, it is not necessary for the dephasing parameters to be exactly equal to
the values obtained by optimization. Large variations in these values still lead to essentially
the same evolution of the population in the sink. However, the values used to obtain figure 5
do give coherent oscillations that last up to about 1 ps, which is roughly consistent with the
experimentally observed coherence time (>600 ps) seen in FMO at 77 K. Similar robustness is
also seen for variations in site energies and inter-site couplings. This sort of robustness and
effectiveness over a broad range of parameters is essential for the notion of noise-assisted
transport to operate in natural conditions.
Although there is no direct evidence that natural evolution has performed such a full
optimization of the EET process with respect to dephasing noise [34], the analysis above
provides a good example of how one could, in principle, optimize EET in an artificial system. By
identifying the naturally effective and inefficient pathways, one could apply noise selectively to
create new pathways to circumvent the inefficient ones using the efficient paths, as in path (IV),
enhance the efficient paths with line broadening, as in path (I) or even remove unwanted
coherent dynamics, such as path (III).
While the microscopic interaction parameters of the FMO pigments and the protein
environment are not well characterized experimentally, our local Markovian description of
the noise neglects a number of potentially important processes, and we now consider two of
these. One of these is the role of spatial correlations in the process of EET. The other is the
presence of temporal correlations or memory in the environment that can lead to altered exciton
dynamics, which are not necessarily governed by a Lindblad-type master equation. The first of
these, spatially correlated noise, can be modelled via the Lindblad term
Ldeph (ρ) = −

γmn [Am , [An , ρ]],

(7)

mn

where Am = σm+ σm− . After a full optimization of all γmn , we find that psink saturates at 0.931 after
5 ps. This small improvement indicates that non-local effects may be of limited importance
for EET in the FMO complex. However, there is experimental evidence for strong spatial
correlations in bacterial RC dynamics [35] and conjugated polymers [36], and correlated noise
has also been predicted to be relevant in other photosynthetic complexes [37].
5. Non-Markovian models

In this last section, we focus on analyzing the possible impact on EET dynamics of deviations
from the Markovian model that we presented in the previous sections. As stressed before, the
theoretical model used in the previous sections treats pure dephasing in a way equivalent to the
phenomenological Haken–Strobl model. However, a number of recent studies of EET in FMO

have looked at the effects of different microscopic models of the exciton–phonon interaction on
the dynamics, and in particular at the non-Markovian dynamics arising from strong coupling
and/or the form of the spectral function of the environment [10, 11, 38–40]. In this section, we
shall consider the structured bath spectral density used by Adolphs and Renger in [21]. This
spectral density contains a contribution from a low-energy continuous density of states and a
discrete high-energy mode, and its effects on the dynamics of a dimer molecule have recently
been simulated using a new and numerically exact application of the time-adaptive density
matrix renormalization group (t-DMRG) method [38]. This study showed that the coupling to
the high-energy mode can lead to oscillations in the dimer population dynamics that persist over
the whole transport time and, moreover, that the efficiency of inter-site transfer in the presence
of these oscillations is just as high as when the high-energy mode is decoupled from the dimer.
In order to see if this coexistence of long-lasting oscillations and efficient transport can operate
in more complex networks, we now go beyond the dimer setting of [38] and look at the effects
of local mode couplings on the EET dynamics of FMO.
We will focus here just on the discrete part of the spectral density and consider a model
in which each FMO chromophore √
is linearly coupled to a harmonic mode with frequency
ωH = 180 cm−1 , with strength g = SH ωh and SH = 0.22, following [21]. To describe these
couplings, we add to the previous Hamiltonian in equation (1) the following two terms:
7

h¯ ωh a +j a j ,

HB =
j=1

g(ai + ai+ )σ j+ σ j− ,

HSB =

(8)

j=1

with HB being the free Hamiltonian for the two-level bath with creation and annihilation
operators a + and a, respectively, and mode frequency ωH , whereas HSB is the system–bath
interaction Hamiltonian with interaction strength g. We note that the frequencies and
interactions strength of the couplings predict a reorganization energy, a measure of the coupling
strength to the localized mode, of SH ωH , which corresponds to a mode occupation of just
SH = 0.22 when the mode relaxes into equilibrium with respect to the exciton-mode interaction
at T = 0 K on a single isolated chromophore with a single excitation present. It is therefore
reasonable to consider the local modes within a two-level approximation, and numerically
monitoring the populations in each local mode confirmed that no local modes were strongly
excited or saturated over the whole time interval of the simulations. We also consider the case
in which each bath mode can be damped with a damping rate , which gives a smooth spectral
width to the bath density of states and hence a decay of the correlation time of the environment.
When this damping is large, the bath spectral density is essentially unstructured in frequency
space and induces a purely Markovian dissipation on the exciton dynamics. The damping is
introduced by considering a Lindblad term Lbath
rad (ρ) of the form as in equation (4), with the
same rate for all the local baths.
In figure 7, we show the site population behaviour as a function of time for the case of
= 1 and the transfer efficiency psink for different values of . Coupling to lightly damped
coherent modes ( = 1) gives a very large improvement of the transport, as compared with the
noiseless case, with psink ∼ 0.95 at 5.5 ps. This is close to complete transfer. Note that for this
case the populations, notably in sites 1 and 2, display strong oscillations for up to 5.5 ps, i.e.
the whole transport time. This is perhaps interesting as it shows that persistent oscillations
are not necessarily inconsistent with fast and total transport. This should be contrasted to
the Lindblad dephasing model of the previous sections, in which we found that excitonic
coherences are observable only over the first 20% of the total transport time when the transport is

Figure 7. Site population and psink versus time (in ps) for the FMO complex.

We show the noiseless case (light green line) and the transfer efficiency for a
non-Markovian model where each site is coupled to a structured phonon bath,
as specified in [21], and for different values of the local bath damping rate
expressed in spectroscopic units (cm−1 ). The site population behaviour is plotted

optimized. Another interesting observation is that this non-Markovian model appears to be able
to implement the enhancement and suppression of pathways through the FMO energy landscape
very well, better in fact than the optimized Markov case. Comparing figures 5 and 7, we see that,
in the local mode simulation, the bath strongly suppresses the transfer of populations from sites 1
and 2 to sites 5–7 that occurs via the resonant path (III) in figure 4 in the absence of noise. While
Markovian noise eventually destroys these coherent oscillations ‘across the molecule’, there is
still a substantial leakage via incoherent tunnelling into sites 5–7 and their total population
reaches as high as 0.3 at 1 ps. In the local mode case, the total population of sites 5–7 never rises
above 0.05. Apart from sites 1 and 2, the only sites to become significantly populated are sites
3 and 4, which are closely linked to the sink. The local modes seem to localize the excitations
more effectively around the sink and prevent the exploration of inefficient paths, like (III) in
figure 4.
From the point of view of noise engineering, it seems that the application of nonMarkovian, quantum noise might allow for a more precise control of the direction and speed
of the dynamics. However, it remains to be shown that the strong effect we see is not just
due to a fine-tuning of exciton and mode parameters in the Hamiltonian, i.e. we would like
to see how robust this non-Markovian DAT is. This point can be partially investigated by
looking at the damping of these modes. As illustrated in figure 7, damping the modes leads
to an incremental improvement in the transport efficiency as the damping rate acting on each
site is increased from the value = 1 (blue curve) to = 10 (red) and = 100 (black). This

incremental improvement in transport efficiency coincides with increasingly fast decay of the
oscillations of the population dynamics (not shown). This shows that the long-lasting population
oscillations in this noise model, which are seen for weak mode damping, are likely to involve
exciton coherences mediated by the local modes.
Increasing the damping of the local modes makes the effective environment seen by
the excitons more Markovian in nature and leads to increases in the transport efficiency,
as evidenced by the behaviour of psink . This conclusion that increasing Markovianity
increases the transport rate differs from the one obtained within a different noise model put
forward recently in [39], where an enhancement of the transfer rate was observed when the
exciton–bath interaction was treated without the Markov approximation. It seems clear that
linking Markovian or non-Markovian effects to an improved or slowed down transfer is not
straightforward and strongly depends on specific features of the noise model being considered;
and perhaps there is no universal, model-independent, relation between non-Markovian effects
and efficiency of EET. As a result, we can conclude that, while the process of EET in FMO is
clearly noise assisted, in the sense that evolution under the exciton Hamiltonian alone cannot
account for the observed transport efficiency, the EET dynamics and the transport efficiency as
measured by psink are very sensitive to the specific noise model. In particular, efficient transport
with long-lasting oscillations might arise from any combination of weak Markovian damping,
slow, non-Markovian environments, as in [10, 40], spatially correlated baths [36] or coupling to
local modes, as shown here.
As the role of noise is clearly crucial for efficient EET, further experimental results are
needed to discriminate between these different noise models. One important issue related
to this is whether or not, at physiological temperatures, the net effect of the dephasing due
to the coupling of the complex to the protein environment can be modelled in terms of
a classical, fluctuating field or must be treated explicitly as a quantum environment. The
dynamical behaviour of quantum correlations among the excitons [11], and also between the
bath and exciton system [41], is also expected to be sensitive to the noise model, and the
recent formulation of efficient techniques for the tomographic characterization of many-body
systems [42] may allow for experiments that can directly probe the nature of the exciton–protein
coupling in photosynthetic complexes.
6. Conclusions

We have revisited the basic mechanisms by which pure dephasing noise can open up or suppress
pathways through the energy landscape of a quantum network, and we have shown how these
processes can dramatically increase the efficiency of EET relative to their noiseless evolution.
Using these insights, we constructed a hybrid basis for analysing the FMO dynamics and
indicated the key pathways that are responsible for the inefficiency of the EET in the absence
of noise. For excitations to propagate efficiently, these pathways must be either avoided or
inhibited, and we have shown within a fully Markovian approach how pure dephasing noise
achieves this and how it effects each of the principal pathways individually. As the identification
of the transport-suppressing pathways is made without any reference to the noise model, we
believe that any noise model that enhances transport must more or less carry out this strategy of
suppressing the inefficient paths and enhancing the direct relaxation channels. This intuition is
supported by our results using the non-Markovian local mode model, where we find a very
effective suppression of the inefficient pathways, leading to a transport time that can even

exceed the optimized Markovian dynamics. The results obtained from these models emphasize
how knowledge of the underlying Hamiltonian, when expressed in an appropriate basis, might
allow the possibility of using applied noise almost as an engineering tool for the creation of
artificial light-harvesting architectures. Although we have demonstrated the technique for the
FMO complex, we could use such a path analysis to quite literally follow the movement of the
excitation across any network to the sink, and enhance the energy flow with selective application
of appropriate noise interactions.
We have also shown in our local mode noise model that the experimentally observed
transfer time can occur through dynamics that preserve coherences and entanglement across
the whole transport time. The optimized Markovian theory can only preserve coherences for
20% of this time. The potential relevance of this observation for understanding the long-lasting
coherences observed in FMO and other photosynthetic complexes still remains unclear, and, in
particular, the effects of temperature must be understood before a connection to the experimental
data can be made. However, this model provides a new, interesting system for studying quantum
noise-assisted transport and further emphasizes one of the underlying messages of this paper,
which is: the necessary tasks for enhancing exciton transport revealed by our path analysis
can be achieved by a wide variety of noise models, each of which can generate very different
dynamics. As noise is a crucial part of the efficiency of EET in photosynthetic complexes, there
is a need for experimental discrimination of noise models. Such studies would also provide clues
to the still unanswered question of whether quantum mechanics, in the form of coherence and
entanglement, is necessary for EET or whether it is just an inevitable consequence of quantum
mechanical evolution on the short lengths and timescales found in PPCs. To answer this question
requires further studies on energy transport across connected networks in the presence of various
noise models, with interesting ramifications for the role of coherence and entanglement in the
dynamics of interacting systems.
