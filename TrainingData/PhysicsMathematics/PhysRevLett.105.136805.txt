The electronic properties of ultrathin crystals of molybdenum disulfide consisting of N ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; 6
S-Mo-S monolayers have been investigated by optical spectroscopy. Through characterization by
absorption, photoluminescence, and photoconductivity spectroscopy, we trace the effect of quantum
confinement on the material’s electronic structure. With decreasing thickness, the indirect band gap,
which lies below the direct gap in the bulk material, shifts upwards in energy by more than 0.6 eV. This
leads to a crossover to a direct-gap material in the limit of the single monolayer. Unlike the bulk material,
the MoS2 monolayer emits light strongly. The freestanding monolayer exhibits an increase in luminescence quantum efficiency by more than a factor of 104 compared with the bulk material.

The transition-metal dichalcogenide semiconductor
MoS2 has attracted great interest because of its distinctive
electronic, optical, and catalytic properties, as well as its
importance for dry lubrication [1–19]. The bulk MoS2
crystal, an indirect-gap semiconductor with a band gap of
1.29 eV [20], is built up of van der Waals bonded S-Mo-S
units [2,5,6,11]. Each of these stable units (referred to as a
MoS2 monolayer) consists of two hexagonal planes of S
atoms and an intermediate hexagonal plane of Mo atoms
coordinated through ionic-covalent interactions with the S
atoms in a trigonal prismatic arrangement (Fig. 1). Because
of the relatively weak interactions between these layers and
the strong intralayer interactions, the formation of ultrathin
crystals of MoS2 by the micromechanical cleavage technique is possible, as demonstrated by Novoselov et al. [21].
In this Letter, we report a systematic study of the evolution of the optical properties and electronic structure of
ultrathin MoS2 crystals as a function of layer number N ¼
1; 2; 3; . . . ; 6. We have investigated samples prepared both
on solid surfaces and as freestanding films, entirely unperturbed by substrate interactions. The properties of the
films were examined by using three complementary spectroscopic techniques: optical absorption, photoluminescence (PL), and photoconductivity, with additional sample
characterization provided by atomic-force microscopy.
The combination of these spectroscopic methods allowed
us to trace the evolution of both the indirect and direct band
gaps of the material as a function of layer thickness N.
With decreasing N, the experiments reveal a progressive
confinement-induced shift in the indirect gap from the bulk
value of 1.29 eV to over 1.90 eV [22]. The change in the
indirect-gap energy was found to be significantly larger
than that of the direct gap, which increased by only 0.1 eV.

As a consequence of these different scaling properties and
as suggested by previous calculations [8,9], the MoS2
crystals exhibit a crossover from an indirect- to a directgap semiconductor in the monolayer limit. In addition to
the signatures of this effect in the absorption and photoconductivity spectra, the PL quantum yield (QY) showed a
dramatic enhancement in going from the dark, indirect-gap
bulk crystal to the bright, direct-gap monolayer [23]. For
our suspended samples, we observed an increase of the PL
QY by more than a factor of 104 for the monolayer compared with the bulk crystal.
We prepared mono- and few-layer MoS2 samples from
bulk MoS2 (SPI Supplies) by using a mechanical exfoliation technique similar to that employed for graphene [21].
Typical samples ranged from 25 to 200 m2 in size.

MoS2 layers on oxide-covered Si substrates that had been
prepared with arrays of holes (1.0 and 1:5 m in diameter)
[24]. We identified areas with thin MoS2 samples with an
optical microscope [Fig. 2(a)]. PL images were also collected to assess sample quality [Fig. 2(b)]. The reflectance
contrast of the samples permits determination of their
thickness with monolayer accuracy, as confirmed by
atomic-force microscopy.
Optical measurements by absorption, PL, and photoconductivity spectroscopy were performed on mono- and
few-layer MoS2 samples. All optical measurements were
carried out under ambient conditions at room temperature
by using an inverted microscope (Nikon) coupled to a grating spectrometer with a CCD camera. The optical beams
were focused on the sample with a spot diameter of
$1 m. For absorption measurements [25], samples on
transparent fused quartz substrates were studied in the
photon energy range of 1:3–3:0 eV by using a quartztungsten-halogen source. For PL studies, suspended samples were excited with a cw solid-state laser at a wavelength
of 532 nm. A low laser power of $50 W (on the sample)
was used to avoid heating and PL saturation [26]. The PL
QY of MoS2 samples was calibrated by using rhodamine
6G molecules as the standard. For the photoconductivity
studies, we prepared field-effect transistors of mono- and
bilayer MoS2 on silicon substrates covered by a 300-nmthick oxide layer. Optical radiation of a well-defined frequency was selected from a supercontinuum laser source
with a monochromator and was modulated with a mechanical chopper. The synchronous signal was detected with a
lock-in amplifier [27].
As an indirect-gap material, band-gap PL in bulk MoS2 is
a weak phonon-assisted process and is known to have
negligible QY. Appreciable PL was, however, observed
from few-layer MoS2 samples, and surprisingly bright PL
was detected from monolayer samples. The measured PL
intensity under identical excitation at 2.33 eV for a suspended monolayer and a bilayer sample is strikingly different
[Fig. 3(a)]. The PL QY drops steadily with increasing
thickness N ¼ 1–6 [Fig. 3(a), inset]. A PL QY on the order

of 10À5 –10À6 was estimated for few-layer samples of
N ¼ 2–6; a value as high as 4 Â 10À3 was observed in
the limit of monolayer thickness. In addition to the significant difference in the PL QY, the normalized PL spectra for
mono- and few-layer samples are quite distinct from one
another [Fig. 3(b)]. The PL spectrum of suspended monolayer samples consists of a single narrow feature of
$50 meV width, centered at 1.90 eV. In contrast, few-layer
samples display multiple emission peaks (labeled A, B, and
I). Peak A coincides with the monolayer emission peak. It
shifts to the red and broadens slightly with increasing N.
Peak B lies about 150 meV above peak A. The broad feature
I, which lies below peak A, systematically shifts to lower
energies, approaching the indirect-gap energy of 1.29 eV,
and becomes less prominent with increasing N [Fig. 3(c)].
To understand the origin of these extraordinary PL properties, we compare the PL to the absorption spectrum of
MoS2 . In the spectral range of 1:3–2:4 eV, absorption of
bulk MoS2 is dominated by two prominent transitions.
They are known to arise from direct-gap transitions between the maxima of split valence bands (v1 and v2) and
the minimum of the conduction band (c1), all located at
the K point of the Brillouin zone (Fig. 1) [7,12–18]. The
splitting arises from the combined effect of interlayer
coupling and spin-orbit coupling. (The latter is not included in the band structure of Fig. 1 for simplicity.) The
absorption spectrum of atomically thin layers of MoS2
(normalized for thickness) was found to be largely
unaltered, except for a slight blueshift of the resonances
[Fig. 4(a)]. The monolayer PL peak A at 1.90 eV matches
the lower absorption resonance in both its position and
width. Therefore, we attribute the PL of monolayer MoS2
to direct-gap luminescence. The result, combined with the
high PL QY, also demonstrates the high quality of the
suspended monolayer samples. For bilayer samples, on
the other hand, emission peaks A and B match the two
absorption resonances and are assigned to direct-gap hot
luminescence [27]. The weak feature between A and B
could be impurity or defect luminescence and merits further investigation. The PL peak I at 1.59 eV ($ 300 meV
below the direct-gap absorption peak), as we discuss
below, is attributed to indirect-gap luminescence.
Probing of the indirect-gap optical transitions in atomically thin layers of MoS2 is limited by the sensitivity of
absorption measurements. In the case of weak exciton
binding, as for MoS2 at room temperature, the photoconductivity spectrum mimics the absorption spectrum.
Therefore, we used photoconductivity spectroscopy to investigate the optical response below the direct gap of monoand bilayer MoS2 [12]. The photoconductivity spectra of
these samples could be recorded with signals ranging over
three decades in strength [Fig. 4(b)]. For bilayer MoS2 , the
onset of photoconductivity occurs around 1.60 eV, coinciding with the PL peak I. The conductivity increases slowly
with photon energy towards the direct band gap, as expected for an indirect-gap material. In contrast, for monolayer MoS2 , the photoconductivity near 1.8 eV increases

(from a negligible value) by about 3 orders of magnitude.
This dramatic rise corresponds to the onset of optical
absorption from the direct band edge [28].
In the following simplified treatment of the spectral
dependence of the photoconductivity, we neglect both excitonic effects and the variation of matrix elements with
energy, factors that should be included in a more comprehensive theory. The absorbance Að@!Þ at photon energy
@! near a direct band edge of energy Eg is then determined
by the joint density of states. For a two-dimensional (2D)
material like our atomically thin layers of MoS2 , this is
described by a step function, Âð@! À Eg Þ [1,29]. After
including a phenomenological broadening of 30 meV to
account for finite temperature and scattering rates, we find
that the photoconductivity spectrum of the monolayer
samples can be fit well to this simple model [Fig. 4(b)].
This indicates that monolayer MoS2 is indeed a direct-gap
material [28]. On the other hand, the photoconductivity
spectrum for bilayer MoS2 cannot be described by the

step-function response. We need to include the effect of
an indirect transition. Near an indirect band edge, the
corresponding absorbance can be represented by [1,29]
P

@!þ@ ÀE0g
Að@!Þ /  ½1ÀexpðÀ@
þ expð@ =kTÞÀ1
 / @! À E0g .
 =kTÞ
Here E0g and @ denote, respectively, the indirect-gap
energy and that of the th phonon mode, and kT is the
thermal energy. By taking this term into account, the
experimental bilayer MoS2 spectrum can be fit well by
an indirect transition at 1.6 eV, combined with a direct
transition at 1.88 eV [Fig. 4(b)].
The indirect-direct-gap crossover as a function of MoS2
thickness N is the result of a significant upshift of E0g
induced by perpendicular quantum confinement. To understand this, let us examine the electronic band structure of
bulk MoS2 (Fig. 1). The direct gap of $1:8 eV occurs
between c1 and v1 at the K point of the Brillouin zone
(transitions A) [3–5,7,12]. On the other hand, the maximum
of v1 and minimum of c1 are located at the À point and

along the À-K direction [3–6,8,11], respectively; they form
an indirect gap of 1.29 eV (transition I) [20]. The out-ofplane mass m? for electrons and holes around the K point
far exceeds the free electron mass m0 ; on the other hand,
m? for holes around the À point is estimated to be $0:4m0
and for electrons around the c1 minimum along the À-K
direction to be $0:6m0 . Thus, while decreasing N leads to
a large confinement-induced increase in the indirect gap
E0g , the direct gap Eg remains almost unchanged. The
indirect-direct-gap crossover is reached in the limit of
monolayer thickness.
To explain this result more precisely, we apply a zonefolding scheme to describe the electronic states of the
ultrathin samples [30,31]. For identical layers with only
nearest-neighbor interlayer interactions, the 2D electronic
structure of few-layer MoS2 samples can be generated as a
subset of the bulk electronic states with quantized out-ofplane momenta k? , i.e., momenta lying in planes perpendicular to the À-A or K-H directions. For monolayer MoS2 ,
the allowed plane passes directly through the H and A
points. The c1 minimum and the v1 maximum of the
resulting 2D bands both occur at the H point (Fig. 1).
Monolayer MoS2 therefore becomes a direct-gap material.
With increasing N, cuts with k? approaching the À-K line
are made. Then the v1 maximum and the c1 minimum
occur at the À point and along the À-K direction, respectively, as in the bulk material. Few-layer MoS2 samples are,
therefore, indirect-gap semiconductors. These findings
agree with earlier ab initio calculations of few-layer MoS2
[8,9]. Our result is distinct from zone-folding-induced pseudodirect transitions in semiconductor superlattice structures
[32], which have very low oscillator strength and PL QY.
The crossover from an indirect-gap material to a directgap material naturally accounts for the more than 104 -fold
enhancement of the luminescence QY observed in monolayer MoS2 . It is consistent with the observed absorption
spectra that show little sensitivity to the layer number N
and a band gap that decreases with increasing N. The
observed dependence of the band gap on N is also in
qualitative agreement with published density-functional
theory calculations [8]. Monolayer MoS2 constitutes the
first atomically thin material that is an effective emitter of
light. Its strong PL suggests its use for photostable markers
and sensors that can be adapted to probe nanoscale dimensions. The controllability of the band gap may also be used
to optimize the material’s use as a photocatalytic agent [19]
and for photovoltaic applications. Our results highlight that
the distinctive electronic properties of atomically thin layered materials are not restricted to graphene but extend to a
broader group of van der Waals bonded solids.
