a b s t r a c t
The rational construction of coordination polymers (CPs), normally existing as inﬁnite crystalline lattices
extended from inorganic vertices and organic struts, essentially beneﬁts from the development of crystal
engineering strategies. In this review, we summarily comment on the key advances in the design of
CPs using mixed-ligand synthetic strategy and discuss the relationship between the speciﬁcally selected
mixed organic ligands and the resulting CPs. Signiﬁcantly, ﬁne tuning on the structural features of organic
ligands, such as spacers, positional isomers, and substituents, can lead to a delicate regulation of the
diverse network structures of CPs. Additionally, such mixed-ligand coordination assemblies may also be
heavily affected by metal ion, synthetic route, and some other external stimuli such as solvent and pH
condition, etc. The advantages of mixed-ligand systems as promising approaches to construct CPs-based
crystalline materials with interesting structures and useful properties will also be demonstrated.

1. Introduction
The creation of new molecules is a major theme of chemistry,
and of great contribution to human well-being and prosperity.
Molecules are architectures of atoms, while crystal engineering
of crystalline solids deals with targeted structures built from
molecules [1,2]. As the prototype of polymeric crystal engineering, coordination polymers (CPs), in some cases also described
as metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) [3], are an intriguing class
of hybrid materials, which exist as inﬁnite crystalline lattices
extended from inorganic vertices (metal ions or clusters) and
organic ligand struts by coordination interactions [4–6]. At this
stage, the rational construction of structurally-deﬁned CPs is quite
successful and a variety of typical examples for such crystalline
materials with attractive network architectures and potential
applications have been reported. In this regard, their possible applications arising from the remarkable physicochemical properties of
CPs are widely recognized in gas adsorption, molecular/ionic separation, optics, electricity, magnetism, chirality, catalysis, and drug
delivery, etc. [7–12]. As a rule, the optimal implementation for
such applications requires good phase purity, framework stability,
and in some cases the available porosity of the targeted materials. Meanwhile, the crystalline nature of CPs materials allows for
the unambiguous determination of crystal structures using X-ray
diffraction technique and further, the proof-of-concept demonstration of structure–property correlation therein. In this context, a
certain degree of structural design and prediction of CPs can be
achieved through a detailed understanding of the building tectons involved, based on prior empirical observations, while their
absolute structural control still remains a long-term goal and a
worthwhile endeavor.
Much work has been devoted to the synthesis, structural characterization, and properties of CPs. In this process, the accumulation
of sufﬁcient experimental data allows chemists to proceed beyond
the random studies and to derive some useful laws of assembly.
Towards this end, several effective synthetic strategies such as
‘node-and-spacer’ [13,14] and ‘secondary building units (SBUs)’
[15,16] have been successfully established and developed, based
on the notion that molecular precursors (metal ions and organic
ligands) can be conveniently conceptualized as objects such as
points, lines, polygons, and polyhedra, with CPs as periodic and
complementary assemblies of these geometric motifs. Nevertheless, there are still many challenges in practice to perfectly project
and regulate the speciﬁc crystal packing of such materials, because
structural control will be readily thwarted by the intricate and noncovalent nature of the secondary interactions such as H-bonding,
aromatic stacking, and van der Waals force, as well as some external
physical or chemical factors including counterion, template, temperature, pressure, solvent, and pH value, etc. [17–25]. The vital
theme in constructing CPs is to achieve a good junction between
the organic tectons with adjustable connecting functions and the

inorganic metal ions with different coordination tendencies. Certainly, metal ions will play a central role in CPs, just as those in
metallopolymers [26–32]. However, in fact, they seem to be more
regular in coordination assemblies, since the optional metal elements are limited to a speciﬁc range of the periodic table and will
possess intrinsic coordination preferences with the given valences.
As a consequence, major effort should be focused on the elaborate
design and selection of a variety of organic ligands to realize the
rational assembly and modulation of CPs.
To date, it is well known that multi-topic bridging ligands with
two or more nitrogen, sulfur, phosphorus, and/or oxygen-involving
functional groups can show different binding abilities to metal
ions and thus can be applied as effective tectons for constructing diverse coordination networks [33]. However, in the scope of
mixed-ligand CPs, ligands such as disulfoxide [34], dithioether [34],
diphosphine [35], and hybrid P,N-type compounds [36] have seldom been used in practice, probably owing to the lack of competent
counterparts as the co-ligands. In contrast, intense research activity
towards the rational design and construction of mixed-ligand CPs
has shown that the bipyridine and polycarboxyl compounds represent the most reliable and typical building blocks which can be
jointly applied to synthesize a wide range of desired coordination
networks. A choice of such connectors in coordination assembly
can be rationalized based on the following considerations. On the
one hand, the neutral bipyridine ligands normally bind to the metal
ions as the rod-like bidentate tectons. On the other hand, polycarboxyl compounds may take the anionic or protonated form to
provide various coordination modes upon binding to metals. Thus,
the underlying structures of CPs obtained from a given bipyridine
spacer can usually be ascribed to known geometrical networks,
at least with hindsight, while assembly of a polycarboxyl bridging ligand with the metal ion under different conditions will lead
to considerable structural complexity and diversity of CPs. As a
result, by combining the advantages of two such types of ligands,
the so-called mixed-ligand synthetic strategy can be rationally
proposed. In this connection, Kitagawa and co-workers [37,38]
have pioneered the synthesis of mixed-ligand CPs with pillaredlayer microporous networks. Recently, this strategy has also been
applied to design and prepare a series of carboxyl-functionalized
porphyrin-based framework materials with diverse bipyridine pillaring linkers, which show emerging applications in gas storage,
heterogeneous catalysis, and light harvesting [39].
According to the different compositions of mixed-ligand CP systems, they can be roughly classiﬁed into three categories: acid–acid,
base–base, and acid–base systems (the concept of acid or base in
this review only indicates the Lewis acid/base ligands). In the broad
domain of CP study, coordination frameworks based on mixed
ligands have been heavily developed. However, no speciﬁc structural prediction and design scheme is available at this stage. In
this contribution, we will focus on current advances in CP systems with mixed bridging ligands, to demonstrate the signiﬁcant

role of mixed-ligand synthetic strategies in deﬁning the assemblies,
structures, and properties of targeted CPs, and establish potential
structure–property correlation for the rational design and construction of CPs in the future.
2. Assembly strategies of mixed-ligands in the construction
of CPs
The strategic assembly of CPs involves both the macroscopic level and the microscopic scale. In this connection, the
mixed-ligand assembly strategy facilitates the self-complement of
reaction parameters at the macroscopic level, such as pH and solubility of the assembled system. While at the microscopic scale, the
void positions around metal ions can be easily occupied by coordination with the mixed ligands, instead of solvents or anions; this
may improve the stability of the resulting coordination architectures. Essentially, two different and compatible mechanisms may
be applied to explain the formation of mixed-ligand CPs, when
two ligand components are allowed to combine with the metal
ions. On the one hand, each ligand will compete to interact with
the metal center. On the other hand, they both serve as donors to
coordinate with the same metal ion. As a result, the ﬁnal CP products can be isolated and puriﬁed by crystallization. Actually, the
mixed-ligand assembly strategy has been widely applied to design
and synthesize numerous acid–base CPs. However, in the case of
using two different ligands with similar coordination functionality
(that is, acid–acid or base–base system), experimental data are so
scarce that there is no basis to interpret even the most fundamental
question (such as phase composition) for these systems.
2.1. Acid–acid mixed-ligand CPs
Previously, H2 tp and H3 tcb have been respectively used to react
with ZnII to afford MOF-5 and MOF-177 under essentially identical
synthetic conditions [40,41]. However, the assembly of both H2 tp
and H3 tcb with Zn(NO3 )2 in DEF upon heating can give a new CP
[Zn4 O(tp)(tcb)4/3 ]n (1a) with hexagonal channels, which crystallizes in space group P63 m (see Fig. 1a) [42]. Interestingly, as the
molar ratio of H3 tcb is changed in the above mixed-ligand system,
three different crystalline phases can be isolated. That is, at a low
concentration of H3 tcb, only MOF-5 is afforded; with increasing
the ratio of H3 tcb (H2 tp:H3 tcb = 4:1), needle crystals of 1a are generated along with MOF-5. The optimal molar ratio of H2 tp:H3 tcb
to form 1a lies between 3:2 and 1:1. Along a further increment
of H3 tcb, MOF-5 decreases and MOF-177 appears, and when the
molar ratio of H2 tp:H3 tcb reaches 2:3, MOF-177 ﬁrst crystallizes
from the reaction solution. These results clearly illuminate the
competition and cooperation relationship between the H2 tp and
H3 tcb components in coordination assemblies of CPs. By modifying
the reaction routes (solvothermal reaction or room-temperature
evaporation) and solvents (DMA or DMF), two additional
CPs {[(CH3 )2 NH2 ][Zn2 (tp)(tcb)][Zn3 (tcb)2 (H2 O)2 ](DMA)4 (EtOH)2 (H2 O)7 }n (1b) and {[(CH3 )2 NH2 ][Zn2 (tp)(tcb)](DMF)3 (H2 O)2 }n (1c)
can also be obtained [43]. In 1b, two distinct polymeric networks
with 2D 63 bilayers and 3D hms net (for the 3-letter network symbols, see ref. [44], the same below) are interpenetrated to result in
an elaborate 2D + 3D framework (see Fig. 1b). While for 1c, a 3-fold
interpenetrating gra framework involving hexagonal chiral helical
channels occurs (see Fig. 1c).
Of further interest, two homochiral porous CPs can be synthesized by heating ZnII nitrate, 2,6-H2 ndc or H2 bpdc with chiral
R-H2 man tecton [45]. By comparison, the assembly of ZnII , H2 tp,
and S-H2 lac affords a 3D chiral CP, which shares the same topological isoreticular structure to the above two CPs, but with smaller
pores [46]. Signiﬁcantly, the different pore sizes and chiral centers

result in distinct stereoselective sorption properties of the porous
materials. That is, the larger pores will effectively and stereoselectively accommodate the bulkier guests, whereas the smaller pores
show higher sorption and enantioselectivity toward the smaller
chiral drug precursors. In addition, a highly selective oxidation
of bulkier sulﬁdes (2-NaphSMe (2-C10 H7 SMe) or PhSCH2 Ph) will
occur in the larger pores, which however is not allowed in the
smaller ones.
Similar to those Lewis acids possessing the carboxyl groups,
mixed H-triazole ligands can also be simultaneously combined in
the same CP, which usually results from the in situ ligand synthesis reaction. For example, the hydrothermal treatment of CdII
with Hamtaz in H2 O/NH3 ·H2 O in the presence of AgI at 130 ◦ C,

conformations in pillaring the 2D [Zn(amtaz)]n layers into 3D
networks (see Fig. 3). The structural characteristics of these CPs
demonstrate that both the layers and pillars tend to ﬂexibly
constitute more compact lattice architectures, and their structural
differentiation is mainly dependent on the lengths and geometries
of the dicarboxylates.
2.2. Base–base mixed-ligand CPs

with the ratio of starting materials of 0.28:0.63:0.23, yields a
homometallic CP [Cd2 (amtaz)2 (aztaz)]n (2) [47]. This reaction can
be regarded as AgI -mediated in situ generation of aztaz2− from
amtaz− through dehydrogenative coupling. In the resulting CP, the
CdII ions are linked by the mixed ligands to afford a complicated 3D
(3,4,5)-connected network with (4.62 )2 (4.67 .82 )2 (65 .10) topology
(see Fig. 2).
Combination of the H-triazole ligand Hamtaz and a series of
comparable carboxylic acids with ZnII produces a family of 3D
pillared-layer CPs [48]. This series of carboxylic acids include
H2 ox, H2 sca, H2 ada, H2 sba, H2 aza, and H2 sea (Scheme 1, see
a–f), which will show different bridging distances and corrugated

CPs with mixed neutral N,N -bidentate ligands are quite rare
and in this context, a typical example [Co(bpy)(bimb)(SCN)2 ]n (3)
is synthesized by hydrothermal reaction of mixed ligands bpy and
bimb with Co(SCN)2 [49]. In this structure, the 2D (4,4) layers of
[Co4 (bpy)2 (bimb)4 ] units are pillared by the bpy rods to produce
a 3D framework, which has a trinodal 4-connected network of
(64 .82 )(63 .83 )2 (65 .8) topology. Two such nets are further entangled
to afford a 2-fold interpenetrating pattern (see Fig. 4).
2.3. Acid–base mixed-ligand CPs
The acid–base system is the most important and ﬂourishing
branch of mixed-ligand CPs. Naturally, acid and base ligands are
perfect partners that can compensate charge balance, coordination
deﬁciency, repulsive vacuum, and weakly interaction all at once. In
this context, it is valuable to propose the rational synthetic strategy
to regulate the network structures of mixed-ligand CPs by ligand

design or selection, considering the aspects of spacer effect, positional isomeric effect, and substituent effect of the organic building
blocks.
2.3.1. Spacer effect
Generally, by deliberately modulating the nature of spacers
between the functional coordinating groups of the bridging ligands, the resulting CP networks can be systematically and regularly
adjusted. This strategy may permit a better understanding of the
relationship between the nature of pillars and the pore sizes of CPs.
Moreover, chemical or physical characteristics such as hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity, hydrogen bonds, and open metal sites can be
achieved by introducing different functional pillars. In principle,
rigid linkers tend to construct 3D open networks with available
cavities. With the increase of spacer length, entanglement of such
nets generally occurs to decrease the empty volumes of the crystal
lattices. In contrast, ﬂexible spacers may promote the generation

of distorted frameworks, leading to dynamic microporous CPs that
can shrink or expand upon external stimuli.
H2 tp and bpy can be viewed as the most popular acid and base
bridging ligands for preparing CPs, which possess the paired functional groups (carboxyl and pyridine) in the two sides of their
backbones. In this regard, hydrothermal reaction of H2 tp, bpy, and
ZnII affords a 2-fold interpenetrating 3D CP [Zn(tp)(bpy)]n (4a),
which contains parallelogram-like [Zn(tp)]n sheets and bpy pillars
(see Fig. 5a) [50]. By introducing the spacers (R) between the pyridine groups of bpy, a series of comparable bpy derivatives with
extended and varied lengths can be obtained and have been extensively applied in the synthesis of mixed-ligand CPs (Scheme 2, see
a–h).
On the one hand, a family of conjugated aromatic spacers can be
used to design the longer rigid bipyridine ligands, including 4,4 -bpt
[51], bpb [52], dfbpb [52], and bpeb [53], assemblies of which with
H2 tp and ZnII will afford a series of comparable 3D CPs of 2-fold
interpenetrating pcu topological networks (4b–4e, see Fig. 5b–e).
In the resulting 3D frameworks, though the pillar lengths vary from
˚ the 2-fold
7.04 A˚ (for bpy, 4a), to 10.74, 11.47, 11.49, and 15.43 A,
interpenetrating structures of such CPs make their lattices more

2-fold interpenetrating arrangements (4a–4e).

M. Du et al. / Coordination Chemistry Reviews 257 (2013) 1282–1305

compact, with the voids being 14.7% (for 4b), 37.9% (for 4c), 40.4%
(for 4d), and 26.5% (for 4e) of the total lattice volumes. Generally,
the longer the pillar is, the higher the void ratio is, as found in
4a–4d. However, the void decreases signiﬁcantly in 4e, which can
be attributed to a better packing efﬁciency of the independent nets.
On the other hand, regarding the changes of spacers with
aliphatic groups, a series of ﬂexible bipyridine ligands can be
obtained, such as bpee, bpea, and bpp. Reactions of H2 tp with

1287

ZnII in the presence of these exo-extended ligands will result
in more ﬂexible coordination species. Notably, all ZnII ions in
these CPs uniformly take the distorted tetrahedral coordination
geometry. In the 3D polymeric pattern of 4f, the ZnII centers are
connected via bridging bpee and tp to form a 3D dia net with
large cavity, which is further ﬁlled by interpenetration of four
other independent and equivalent networks [54]. The assembly
of bpea with H2 tp and ZnCl2 produces a 2D CP 4g in which one

chloride anion occupies a coordination site of ZnII to prevent further structural extension [55]. Due to the greater ﬂexibility of bpp,
ﬁve distinct polymeric networks can be constructed under different conditions. For instance, the hydrothermal reaction of ZnII ,
H2 tp, and bpp under 100 ◦ C results in [Zn(tp)(bpp)]n (4h1 , see
Fig. 6a), which shows the 2D corrugated layers of 2-fold interpenetration [56]. Interestingly, the assembly of Zn(NO3 )2 , H2 tp, and bpp
under a one-pot hydrothermal reaction at 160 ◦ C simultaneously
yields two different products, namely, yellow diamond crystals of
{[Zn(tp)(bpp)]2 (H2 O)3 }n (4h2 , see Fig. 6b) and white prism crystals
of [Zn4 (tp)4 (bpp)2 ]n (4h3 , see Fig. 6c), which exhibit the polycatenation feature of 2D + 2D inclined layers and parallel entanglement
of 2D 6-connected bilayers, respectively [57]. By mixing two such
ligands in alkaline conditions, a new CP {[Zn(tp)(bpp)](H2 O)2 }n
(4h4 , see Fig. 6d) with a 3-fold interpenetrating 66 framework is
afforded [58]. Unlike 4h2 and 4h3 , hydrothermal reaction of ZnCl2 ,
H2 tp, and bpp at 160 ◦ C gives a 3D CP [Zn2 (tp)(bpp)Cl2 ]n (4h5 , see
Fig. 6e), which shows the 2-fold interpenetrating cds topological
framework [59].
Taking bis-imidazolyl into consideration instead of bipyridine,
the spacer effect on structural assemblies of CPs can also be
observed (Scheme 3, see a–e). Hydrothermal reaction of ZnII , H2 tp,
and bib affords a 3D pcu topological framework of 3-fold interpenetration (5a) [60]. By replacing the phenyl group with the
more ﬂexible p-bimethylphenyl spacer, two new CPs (5b1 and
5b2 ) constructed from ZnII , H2 tp, and bix are obtained under
different reaction conditions, showing a 2D + 2D → 3D entangled
pattern consisting of inclined layers and a 2D + 2D → 2D 3-fold
parallel interpenetrating framework, respectively [61]. By further decorating the phenyl rings with four methyl substituents,
two temperature-induced ZnII CPs 5c1 and 5c2 involving tp and
bimx can be synthesized under hydrothermal conditions [62].
5c1 consists of stacking composited layers each being 2-fold
interpenetrating 2D square grids, while 5c2 has a 3D pcu open
framework with large channels that are occupied by H2 tp templates. Employing the more ﬂexible bis-imidazolyl ligand with the
–(CH2 )2 O(CH2 )2 – spacer (bie) in a similar assembled system yields
a quite rare 3-fold interpenetrating ths framework (5d) [63]. Further enlarging the spacer to –(CH2 )2 O(CH2 )2 O(CH2 )2 – results in a
signiﬁcantly ﬂexible bbi ligand, which can bridge the ZnII centers
with the aid of tp co-ligand to construct a uniform 8-connected
(36 .418 .53 .6) net for 5e with the trinuclear ZnII clusters as SBUs [64].
In the mixed-ligand CP systems with bis-triazolyl and H2 tp, the
inserted spacers between two terminal triazolyl rings will clearly
make the resulting ligands more ﬂexible and adjustable (Scheme 4,
see a–e). In {[Zn(tp)(bte)](H2 O)2 }n (6a), the [Zn2 (bte)2 ] binuclear

units are interlinked by the bridging tp ligands to generate a
2D rhombic network [65]. Diffusion reactions of ZnII chloride or
nitrate with mixed btp and H2 tp ligands lead to the formation
of two different CPs {[Zn(tp)(btp)][Zn(tp)0.5 (btp)Cl](H2 O)}n (6b1 )
and {[Zn(tp)(btp)](CH3 OH)(H2 O)2 }n (6b2 ) [66]. CP 6b1 features
an interesting entangled pattern, in which half of the channels
within the parallel 2D layers are polythreaded by 1D arrays,
whereas 6b2 shows a familiar 2D 63 network. By changing the
pH of the reaction medium, the assembly of ZnII , H2 tp, and btb
can afford two distinct CPs {[Zn2 (tp)2 (btb)2 ](H2 O)2 }n (6c1 ) and
[Zn(tp)(btb)0.5 ]n (6c2 ) based on tetrahedral and octahedral SBUs,
respectively [67]. As a result, they show the 3-fold interpenetrating
dia array and 3-fold interpenetrating pcu framework, respectively.
When more bulky spacers are further introduced into the tectons,
2D CPs [Zn(tp)(btmb)]n (6d) [68] and [Zn(tp)(ﬂu)]n (6e) [69] with
polymeric grids can be constructed, probably due to the steric
effect of aromatic spacer groups.
Various base-type bridging ligands, involving paired pyridine (Scheme 5, see a–f), imidazole, and triazole groups with
different spacers in between, have also been applied to react
with angular rigid dicarboxylic acids to form well-deﬁned CPs,
which can be regulated by the spacer effect of ligands. For
example, H2 ip has been extensively used to construct CPs and
those of ZnII , H2 ip, and bpy exhibit evident structural diversity. CPs {[Zn(ip)(bpy)(H2 O)](H2 O)1.5 }n (7a1 , see Fig. 7a) and
{[Zn2 (ip)2 (bpy)(EtOH)(H2 O)2 ](EtOH)(H2 O)0.5 }n (7a2 , see Fig. 7b)
can be prepared under similar condition except for different
molar ratios of the reactants, which show 2D square and 2D
interpenetrating hcb networks, respectively [70]. For the hydrothermal reaction product [Zn4 O(ip)3 (bpy)]n (7a3 , see Fig. 7c),
the tetranuclear SBUs bearing Zn4 O cores are extended by ip
and bpy to construct a 2D network [71]. Hydrothermal reaction of ZnII , H2 ip, and bpy in alkaline solution gives a novel CP
{[Zn(ip)(bpy)2 ][Zn(ip)(bpy)](H2 O)0.25 }n (7a4 , see Fig. 7d), within

which two types of distinct 2D components are paratactically
arranged in an ABCD sequence without interpenetration [72]. By
heating the mixture of ZnII , H2 ip, and bpy in DMF, another 2D
layered CP {[Zn2 (ip)2 (bpy)2 ](DMF)}n (7a5 , see Fig. 7e) is formed,
which shows the interdigitated porous pattern with a hydrophobic
pore surface and selective gas sorption behavior upon structural
transformation [73].
By inserting some conjugated spacers between the bipyridine
skeleton, such as benzene (for bpb), 1,2,4,5-tetrazine (for bptz), and
acetylene (for bpae), three extended bipyridine derivatives can be
available to construct microporous CPs (7b–7d) with ZnII and H2 ip
[74]. Similar to that of 7a5 , they all show the interdigitated motifs of
layers with 1D bottleneck-type channels running along the perpendicular direction of layer stacking, which however possess distinct
ﬂexibility owing to the different spacers of the bipyridine bridges.
Further, when the intercalary spacers are replaced with ﬂexible
ethyl (for bpea) or propyl (for bpp) groups, the resulting coordination networks will be self-adaptable to show entangled features.
For example, assembly of ZnII , H2 ip, and bpea with proper solvents
as guests affords a series of CPs {[Zn(ip)(bpea)]·(guest)}n with two
types of isomeric supramolecular architectures: a 2D rectangular
coordination grid interpenetrated by noncovalent (6,3) network
consisting of organic guests (7e1 ), and a 3D dia polymeric structure
of 3-fold interpenetration (7e2 ) [75]. However, for [Zn(ip)(bpea)]n
(7e3 ) with no template solvent, the ZnII ions are extended by the
two bridging linkers to afford corrugated sheets with signiﬁcant
voids to be 3-fold interpenetrating [55]. By enlarging the bridging
linker from bpea to bpp, the assembled reaction affords a 3D CP
[Zn(ip)(bpp)]n (7f) with large pores to accommodate 4-fold interpenetration with other sub-lattices [55].
Another typical case for demonstrating the effect of different
alkyl spacers of the N-donor ligands on the resulting coordination frameworks can be deﬁned from the reaction system of
ZnII , H2 ip, and the ﬂexible bis[(pyridine)benzimidazole] tectons,
namely, bbpb, hbpb, and dbpb (Scheme 6, see a–c). Changing the
spacer lengths of such tectons by different –(CH2 )n – groups (n = 4,
6, and 10) will result in drastic changes of ﬂexibility in ligand

binding and linking capability, which thus can well regulate the
network structures of CPs from 1D chain motif, to 2D (6,3) sheet
pattern, and then to 3D pcu topological architecture of 2-fold interpenetration [76].
In the mixed-ligand assembled system of H2 pa with two carboxyl groups in a more acute angle, and different bipyridine
co-ligands (Scheme 7, see a–d), the signiﬁcant spacer effect of
such tectons on the construction of CPs will further be observed.
In {[Zn(pa)(bpy)(H2 O)2 ](H2 O)2 }n (8a) [77], both types of ligands
play bridging roles to extend the ZnII ions into a regular squaregrid polymeric sheet. By inserting the triazolyl spacer between
the two pyridine terminals, the longer 4,4 -bpt ligand can be used
to react with H2 pa and ZnII to form a 2D CP [Zn(pa)(4,4 -bpt)]n
(8b) with a wave-like layered motif [51], being more distorted in
comparison with 8a. Relying on the relative orientation of three
methylene groups between the pyridine groups, the ﬂexible bpp
ligand can adopt distinct conformations in coordination assemblies.
In {[Zn2 (pa)2 (bpp)2 ](H2 O)2 }n (8c) [78], the phthalate-bridged helical arrays [Zn(pa)]n are interlinked by bpp linkers with different
conformations to form a 3D acentric CP with cds topology. When
replaced with a more bulky substituent between the two pyridine
terminals, the resulting ﬂexible bpmbp tecton can be assembled
with H2 pa and ZnII ions to form [Zn(pa)(bpmbp)]n (8d) showing a
1D two-leg ladder motif [79], in which the [Zn(bpmbp)]n chains can
be considered as the side rails and pa2− ligands as the cross rungs.

and a series of comparable bipyridyl ligands with different spacers, including (a)
bpy, (b) azpy, and (c) bpp.

As an analogue but bulkier derivative of H2 pa, 2,3-H2 ndc
with the extended ␲-conjugated skeleton has also been utilized to assemble with CdII and comparable bpy-like bridging
tectons (Scheme 8, see a–c), yielding a series of CPs to
demonstrate the spacer effect [80]. With regard to {[Cd(2,3ndc)(bpy)0.5 (H2 O)2 ](H2 O)}n (9a), the CdII centers are extended by
2,3-ndc and bpy along two different axes to form a 2D coordination layer of (3,4)-connected (42 .6)(42 .63 .8) pattern (see Fig. 8a).
In order to explore further the effect of spacers on the molecular
tectonics of CPs, a semi-rigid ligand azpy with rich -conjugated
backbone is used to construct a 3D mixed-ligand CP {[Cd(2,3ndc)(azpy)(H2 O)](H2 O)}n (9b) (see Fig. 8b). The ﬁnal architecture
can be simpliﬁed as an unusual uninodal 4-connected irl net with
(42 .63 .8) topology. When the more ﬂexible bpp co-ligand with the
separation of two coordination sites of ca. 10 A˚ is used, a 3D chiral
CP {[Cd(2,3-ndc)(bpp)2 ](H2 O)3 }n (9c) can be obtained (see Fig. 8c).
Within this structure, a pair of right-handed and left-handed 21
helical chains of [–Cd–bpp–]n and [–Cd–(2,3-ndc)–]n , running perpendicularly along the [100] and [010] axes, respectively, are
extended by Cd–O/N coordination bonds to afford a 3D dia lattice.
A remarkable spacer effect has also been observed with the homologous mixed-ligand CP systems of AgI and ZnII metal centers [81].
By comparison, selecting those aromatic dicarboxylic acids
with ﬂexible spacers will bring more intricacy into CPs. In this
context, the mixed-ligand assembled system of H2 oba and the
bipyridine-type co-ligands (Scheme 9, see a–d) is a representative example to demonstrate the spacer effect therein. Owing to
the oxygen center positioning between the two benzenecarboxyl
groups, the adjustable connecting angle Ccarboxyl –O–Ccarboxyl of
H2 oba will be responsive to the diverse CP structures. Notably,
assembly of ZnII with bpy and the ﬂexible H2 oba ligand gives
three distinct CPs under different conditions. In [Zn2 (oba)2 (bpy)]n
(10a1 ) [82], the trigonal-bipyramidal ZnII ions are connected by
the mixed ligands to constitute a 3D CP (see Fig. 9a), where
the oba ligands exhibit two different connecting angles (116
and 125◦ ). In {[Zn2 (oba)2 (bpy)](DMA)}n (10a2 ) [83], the angular connector oba (118◦ ) with the aid of bpy, can interlink the
paddle-wheel binuclear [Zn2 (COO)4 ] SBUs into a 3D CP (see
Fig. 9b), which interestingly exhibits an unique selectivity for
the detection of high explosives and other aromatics via ﬂuorescence quenching and enhancement mechanism. With respect to
CP {[Zn3 ( 3 -OH)( 2 -OH)(bpy)0.5 (oba)2 ](H2 O)0.5 }n (10a3 ) [84], the
trimeric [Zn3 ( 3 -OH)] cores are extended by 2 -OH groups to produce unprecedented helical chains, which are pillared by bpy and
oba (124 and 116◦ ) to afford a 3D network (see Fig. 9c). Assembly
of H2 oba with ZnII and bptz co-ligand yields a 3D self-catenated
framework {[Zn2 (oba)2 (pytz)](DMF)2 }n (10b), exhibiting a uninodal 6-connected network with (44 .610 .8) topology (see Fig. 9d)
that can be properly attributed to the mixed-linkers of angular
oba (117◦ ) and elongated pytz [85]. Further introduction of the
–N N– and –C C– spacers [86] into the bipyridine ligands will lead
to more structural diversity. In {[Zn2 (oba)2 (azpy)(DMF)2 ](DMF)6 }n
(10c) [87], the oba (122◦ ) and azpy ligands play the roles of side
rails and rungs, respectively, linking the ZnII ions to form a 1D ladder (see Fig. 9e). For {[Zn2 (oba)2 (bpee)](DMF)2 (H2 O)4 }n (10d) [87],

the distorted oba ligands (125◦ ) with a more obtuse angle connect
the ZnII centers to form a 2D sheet with [Zn2 (COO)4 ] paddle-wheel

Very recently, Wang et al. have developed a family of mixedligand CPs on the basis of a multicarboxylate ligand H3 nbtc and
different bipyridine-type co-ligands (Scheme 10, see a–d). Reactions of ZnII with H3 nbtc and bpy or bpee produce two unusual
3D self-penetrating CPs of 4-connected (4.104 .12)2 (43 .62 .8)2 (44 .62 )
and (4.62 .72 .8)2 (42 .62 .7.8) topologies, respectively [88]. Replacing the spacers of bipyridine co-ligands by ethyl (bpea) or
propyl (bpp), another two 3D ZnII CPs showing a trinodal (4,5)connected (3.4.53 .6)(3.52 .62 .84 .9)(3.4.5.83 ) and a 4-connected
(4.64 .8)(44 .62 )(43 .63 ) topological networks are afforded, respectively [89]. Owing to the distinct spacers within the bipyridine
co-ligands, the resulting 3D coordination frameworks can be modulated from the self-entangled to normal networks with different
topologies. Similarly, the signiﬁcant spacer effect has also been
demonstrated in the CdII [89], MnII [90], CoII [91], CuII [91], and
NiII [91] CPs with such mixed ligands.
In general, enhancement of the ligand lengths may cause the
framework interpenetration of CPs to decrease the void volumes of
overall crystal lattices. However, Cao et al. have reported a series of
non-interpenetrating CPs formulated as {[Cd4 (tdpm)L4 ](solvent)}n

(L = bpy for 11a; azpy for 11b; bpea for 11c; bpb for 11d, Scheme 11,
see a–d) based on the pillaring strategy of mixed-ligand systems.
Signiﬁcant spacer effect has been observed, that is, the pore sizes
can be continuously tuned with elongation of the pillars and the
network topologies vary from nbo to mot types for different stacking fashions of the layers [92]. In these four CPs, the binuclear
[Cd2 ( -O)2 O6 N4 ] metal clusters are connected by mix-pillared
building blocks, in which one of them is varied by length and ﬂexibility to result in different pore sizes and network topologies. In
11a–11c, the architectures show the nbo topology with the window dimensions of the network cavities ranging from 11.7 × 10.0
to 14.0 × 10.0 A˚ 2 (see Fig. 10a–c). Notably, due to the different dispositions of the layers along the c axis, 11d takes a distinct mot
network with the pore size of 16.1 × 10.0 A˚ 2 (see Fig. 10d).
2.3.2. Positional isomeric effect
Ligands with the same coordination groups but locating at different positions may lead to signiﬁcant positional isomerism to
affect the structural assemblies of CPs, especially for mixed-ligand
CP systems.
As the most representative examples of positional isomerism,
the three aromatic dicarboxylic acids (H2 pa, H2 ip, and H2 tp),
possessing an angle-increased binding tendency, are active in regulating the structural assemblies of mixed-ligand CPs (Scheme 12,
see a–c). Reactions of bpy and CdII with this series of isomeric
dicarboxyl ligands result in diverse structures. In [Cd(Hpa)2 (bpy)]n
(12a), the CdII centers are bridged by the V-shaped Hpa ligands to produce exclusive right-handed helical chains, which
are further extended by bpy to afford a fascinating 3D chiral
network [93]. When H2 pa is replaced with H2 ip, the resulting {[Cd(ip)(bpy)](H2 O)}n (12b) shows a 2D rectangular grid-like
layer via the interlinking roles of ip and bpy along different

directions [94]. Solvothermal reactions of CdII , bpy, and H2 tp can
afford two distinct CPs, a non-interpenetrating 3D pcu framework
{[Cd(tp)(bpy)](DMF)3 (H2 O)}n (12c1 ) and its 2-fold interpenetrating form [Cd(tp)(bpy)]n (12c2 ), which can be easily synthesized
with good phase purity by changing the reaction temperature and
the concentration of starting materials [50,95]. Speciﬁcally, lower
temperature and concentration will favor the isolation of 12c1 ,
while increasing both such parameters leads to the formation of
12c2 .
Recently, some analogous linkers derived from the proper
modiﬁcation of the classical bpy tecton have been employed in
coordination assemblies, which have dissimilar backbone ﬂexibility and thus, give rise to a profound steric effect on the direction
of unexpected coordination motifs. In this regard, mixed-ligand
CPs with a bent bipyridine derivative 4,4 -abpt and isomeric
dicarboxylates (Scheme 13, see a–c) can be modulated by such
positional isomeric tectons. For example, a series of mixedligand CdII CPs have been synthesized by the combination of
4,4 -abpt and the benzenedicarboxylate isomers H2 pa, H2 ip, and
H2 tp [96,97]. Their structural analysis reveals that these isomers

show versatile interconnecting functions to manage the metal
centers to form various coordination networks. For {[Cd(4,4 abpt)(pa)(H2 O)] (H2 O)}n (13a), the neighboring CdII ions are
connected by the pa components to produce 1D polymeric chains
along the [010] direction, which are further extended via the
4,4 -abpt spacers to result in a 2D (4,4) layer (see Fig. 11a). In
{[Cd2 (4,4 -abpt)(ip)2 (H2 O)4 ](H2 O)6 }n (13b), each CdII center can
be regarded as a 3-connected T-shaped connector, and is surrounded by the carboxylate oxygen donors of two ip ligands in
the horizontal orientation and a bipyridine nitrogen atom in the
vertical direction. Thus, the extension of such T-shaped CdII nodes
gives a 2D bilayer with (82 .10) topology. Notably, the bilayer
arrays exhibit a unique structural feature of 3D stacking, which
are alternately arranged in tongue-and-groove interpenetrating
mode and interdigitating fashion (see Fig. 11b). The coordination
networks of {[Cd(4,4 -abpt)(tp)(H2 O)]2 (DMF)1.5 (H2 O)}n (13c1 ) and
{[Cd2 (4,4 -abpt)2 (tp)2 (H2 O)(DMF)] (DMF)2 }n (13c2 ) seem similar
¯
although they crystallize in different space groups (P21 /n vs P 1),
which exhibit the 2D corrugated layers of 2-fold interpenetrating

mode, resulting from the linkages of both tp and 4,4 -abpt bridging ligands (see Fig. 11c). Additionally, a similar isomeric effect has
been observed in the corresponding CoII CP system [96].
By considering the ﬂexibility of organic ligands, such a structuredirecting effect of the orientation of carboxyl groups will be more
evident in CP assembly. For example, combining the ﬂexible bix
ligand and CdII with a series of ﬂexible isomers of phenylenediacetic
acids (o/m/p-H2 pda, Scheme 14, see a–c) will lead to the formation of three distinct CPs [98]. In the 2D nets of [Cd(o-pda)(bix)]n
(14a) and [Cd(m-pda)(bix)0.5 (H2 O)]n (14b), hetero-handed helical
arrays are constructed due to the ligand ﬂexibility, which exhibit
a (3,5)-connected (42 .6)(42 .67 .8) topology and a (3,4)-connected

Scheme 14. Illustration of the mixed-ligand assembled system with CdII , bix, and

V2 O5 -type (42 .6)(42 .63 .8) topology, respectively. In contrast, CP
[Cd(p-pda)(bix)]n (14c) shows a distinct 3D dia framework of 5-fold
interpenetration.
As stated above, modifying the positions of carboxyl groups on
aromatic ligand backbones represents an effective approach to regulate the CP crystal structures. To further explore the isomeric effect
of bipyridine ligands on CP structural assemblies, a bent bipyridine
derivative 4-bpo and its 3-N-donor isomer 3-bpo with versatile
binding fashions are selected (Scheme 15, see a–b). The diversity
of the established structural motifs constructed by two such building blocks and familiar metal ions has been reviewed [99], which
illustrates the broad range of the resulting coordination architectures [99,100]. In comparison with the simple bipyridine ligands,
there are several interesting features of 3-bpo and 4-bpo tectons as
described below. (a) Both ligands with multiple coordination sites
can adopt different binding fashions to construct diverse coordination patterns. (b) Their ligand geometries are bent and variable.
That is, the dihedral angles between the oxadiazole group and two
terminal pyridine groups as well as the angle between the centroid
of oxadiazole and two pyridine nitrogen donors are adaptable to
meet the coordination requirements. (c) The oxadiazole ring usually has a tendency to completely or partly participate in secondary
interactions, through which the resulting lattice arrangements of
coordination motifs may be signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced. (d) Especially,
the 3-bpo ligand can potentially adopt three typical conformations
to self-adjust in coordination assemblies. For example, reactions of
CdII with H3 sip and 3-bpo or 4-bpo under acidic condition (pH 2.5)
produce two distinct CPs [21]. Owing to the different coordination
modes and conformations of the mixed ligands, the resulting network structures present the 2D polymeric layer and 1D zigzag chain
patterns. In a similar way, reactions of CoII with H3 sip and 3-bpo or
4-bpo afford a discrete coordination complex or a 1D array, respectively, manipulated by the positional isomeric character of the
ligands [21]. In this regard, Yan et al. have also systematically studied the impact of positional isomeric ligands on the structures and
magnetic properties of CoII CPs with three bipyridine tectons bearing 1H-1,2,4-triazole spacer (4,4 -, 3,4 - and 3,3 -bpt) and phenyl
dicarboxylates, which display a variety of network structures and
different magnetic behaviors [101].
Altering both the acid- and base-type positional isomeric tectons in a CP assembly will result in more signiﬁcant structural
divergence. For example, similar reactions of CuII salt with mixedligand system 3,3 -abpt/H2 ip or 4,4 -abpt/H2 tp (Scheme 16, see
a–b) afford two CPs. In {[Cu(ip)(3,3 -abpt)](H2 O)2 }n (15a), the bent
ip ligands link the CuII ions to result in 1D ribbons along [010],
which are further extended through the bent 3,3 -abpt bridges to
afford a 2D (4,4) net (see Fig. 12a) [102]. However, CP {[Cu(tp)(4,4 abpt)(H2 O)]2 [Cu(tp)(4,4 -abpt)2 ](H2 O)2 }n (15b) that involves the

more linear linkers tp and 4,4 -abpt consists of two distinct polymeric motifs: an inﬁnite tp-bridged 1D array and a planar 2D
(4,4) net generated from the connectivity of both tp and 4,4 abpt bridges, which are further entangled to construct a unique
1D + 2D → 3D polythreading architecture (see Fig. 12b) [97]. Similar results are also found in the NiII CPs involving the mixed-ligand
system 3,3 -abpt/tp [103] or 4,4 -abpt/ip [96], showing a 1D chain
and a 2D square grid layer, respectively.
2.3.3. Substituent effect
Theoretically speaking, the substituents attached to the backbones of organic ligands probably inﬂuence the network structures
of CPs in two aspects [104–107]. On the one hand, they may possess
additional interconnecting functions to extend the coordination

motifs, in view of their ability to form coordination and secondary
interactions such as H-bonding and aromatic stacking. On the other
hand, those inert substituents may impose remarkable steric and/or
electronic effects on the binding properties of organic ligands, and
consequently, the network structures of the resulting CPs.
A series of CoII , CuII or CdII CPs have been constructed by
selecting 3,3 -abpt incorporated with H2 ip, H2 nip, and H3 tma,
respectively, as building blocks (Scheme 17, see a–c) [102]. For
instance, {[Cd(ip)(3,3 -abpt)(H2 O)](H2 O)1.5 }n (16a) shows a 1D
molecular ladder array, where the mixed ligands 3,3 -abpt and ip
serve as the rung and railway, respectively (see Fig. 13a). In comparison, although the nitro group in H2 nip is seldom engaged in
metal coordination, it will signiﬁcantly change the electronic density of the ligand as a strong electron withdrawing group, and also
can be regarded as a reliable hydrogen-bonding acceptor. With this
understanding, the 2D (6,3) coordination layers in {[Cd2 (nip)2 (3,3 abpt)2 (H2 O)4 ](H2 O)2 }n (16b) (see Fig. 13b) are further extended
by the nitro-involved H-bonding interactions to afford a 3D network. The 5-carboxyl group of H3 tma can be presented as the
potential deprotonation regulator, active coordination site, and
donor/acceptor of H-bonding. As a result, in the 1D chain-like
CP {[Cd(Htma)(3,3 -abpt)(H2 O)2 ](H2 O)2 }n (16c) (see Fig. 13c), the
Htma ligand takes the dianion form for charge balance with 5carboxyl and as the H-bonding donor for lattice extension.
A series of CdII CPs have been designed and hydrothermally
synthesized using 3-bpo and R-isophthalic acids (R = –H, H2 ip;
–CH3 , H2 mip; –OCH3 , H2 moip; –tBu, H2 tbip; –OH, H2 hip; –NO2 ,
H2 nip), which show diverse 1D and 2D coordination networks
[108]. The substituent effect of R-isophthalate and the adaptable
conformations of 3-bpo (cisoid-I, cisoid-II, and transoid) play a
decisive role in directing the assembly of such mixed-ligand CPs
(Scheme 18, see a–f). In {[Cd2 (ip)2 (3-bpo)2 (H2 O)2 ](H2 O)2 }n (17a)
and [Cd(mip)(3-bpo)]n (17b), all the 3-bpo ligands adopt the cisoidI conformation, which connect the CdII ions with the aid of bridging
R-isophthalates to form a 1D double chain and a 1D cage-like array,
respectively (see Fig. 14a and b). In the structure of [Cd2 (moip)2 (3bpo)H2 O)4 ][Cd2 (moip)2 (3-bpo)2 (H2 O)3 ](H2 O)3 }n (17c), there are
two types of 2D coordination nets, in which the moip ligands show
the bis-chelating connecting fashion and the 3-bpo ligands take
the cisoid-I and cisoid-II conformations with different unidentate
and bridging coordination modes (see Fig. 14c). Interestingly, due
to the difference of two such sets of 2D layers that are arranged
in the ABAB way with polythreading character, the overall crystal displays chiral nature (see Fig. 14c). When H2 tbip and H2 hip are
employed, a pair of comparable 2D CPs [Cd2 (tbip)2 (3-bpo)(H2 O)4 ]n
(17d) and [Cd2 (hip)2 (3-bpo)3 (H2 O)2 ](H2 O)8 }n (17e) are obtained,
in which the 3-bpo ligands present the cisoid-II and transoid conformations, respectively (see Fig. 14d and e). When H2 nip with
the electron-withdrawing substituent is used instead, a 1D CP
{[Cd(nip)(3-bpo)](H2 O)}n (17f) that is similar to 17b is achieved

(see Fig. 14f). Other mixed-ligand CP systems containing the 3-bpo
building block are also observed to be structurally modulated by
the substituent effect of carboxyl-involved co-ligands [104,109].
The versatile ligand bpe, as a bifunctional building block
[110,111], and the derivatives of the familiar dicarboxylate ligands isophthalate and terephthalate, with coordination-inert
groups (such as –SO3 H, –NH2 , and –Br) are used to assemble

new CPs with AgI (Scheme 19, see a–e) [112]. [Ag(ip)0.5 (bpe)]n
(18a) represents a 3D polymeric lattice that crystallizes in the
acentric space group Fdd2, where both ip and bpe ligands play
the bridging roles to extend the AgI centers to afford a 3D ths
network (see Fig. 15a). When H2 ip is replaced by H3 sip, a 2D layered CP {[Ag3 (sip)(bpe)2 (H2 O)](H2 O)}n (18b) is obtained, where
the sulfonate group of sip is involved in metal binding and the

metal-ligand ratio is changed to 3:1. As a result, three different types of AgI centers are connected by both sip and bpe
ligands to form a new type of 2D (4.62 )(43 .62 .8)(44 .66 ) topological net (see Fig. 15b). Further, the CPs [Ag(tp)0.5 (bpe)]n
(18c) and [Ag(atp)0.5 (bpe)]n (18d) are isostructural with
the 2D (6,3) layer (see Fig. 15c). Interestingly, the steric
effect of –Br group in the btp tecton leads to the construction of a quite intricate 3D self-penetrating framework for
{[Ag6 (btp)2 (bpe)4 (NO3 )2 (H2 O)](H2 O)2 }n (18e) (see Fig. 15d), in
which six types of AgI centers with diverse coordination spheres
and two btp2− ligands with 3 - and 7 -bridging modes are
observed.

Beyond the organic building blocks, the assembly of mixedligand CPs is sensitive to other factors such as solvent, pH, metal

ion, and synthetic route. Towards this objective, a number of typical
examples will be discussed here, illustrating the fact that mixedligand CPs can be well modulated by such parameters to reveal their
remarkable role in the construction of CPs.
3.1. Solvent
Generally, most CP systems are prepared from solvent media,
but they are usually insoluble once synthesized, due to their polymeric nature. Thus, the choice of solvent is critical to achieve the
phase-pure preparation of such crystalline materials and construct
diverse coordination networks [113–116], taking account of reaction thermodynamics and activation energetics [117–119].
Two unusual solvent-controlled CPs have been obtained
from the hydrothermal assemblies of NaH2 sip and bpy with
CdII nitrate in EtOH-H2 O and H2 O solvents, respectively [120].
A 2D CP {[Cd2 (sip)(bpy)3 (H2 O)3 ][Cd(sip)(bpy)(H2 O)](H2 O)8 }n
(19a) can be prepared in EtOH-H2 O, consisting of cationic

[Cd2 (sip)(bpy)3 (H2 O)3 ]n n+ and anionic [Cd(sip)(bpy)(H2 O)]n n−
layers. In the anionic layer, the CdII centers are interconnected by
the sip and bpy linkers to form a 2D step-like network, whereas the
cationic layer displays a decorated 2D step-like pattern with the
unidenate bpy terminals protruding from both sides. The two types
of counterion layers are arranged in an alternate fashion, where
the uncoordinated bpy end from the cationic layers penetrates into
the cavities of the anionic layers to form a tightly stacked neutral
lattice, with the aid of electrostatic forces and H-bonding interactions (see Fig. 16a). A similar reaction in H2 O affords a distinct
3D self-penetrating framework {[Cd3 (sip)2 (bpy)4 (H2 O)2 ](H2 O)3 }n
(19b), where two types of 1D patterns consisting of [Cd4 (sip)4 ] and
[Cd4 (bpy)4 ] subunits, respectively, are entangled by interlocking
and interweaving (see Fig. 16b).
Of further signiﬁcance, the solvent-induced breathing effect of
the dynamic mixed-ligand CPs has also been demonstrated. That
is, expanding and shrinking of the pores within the coordination
networks is often concomitant with hydration and dehydration
processes (see Fig. 17a). In this regard, the hydration or dehydration
induced dynamic conversions of interpenetrating grid-like frameworks with both open and closed phases can be viewed as a simple
glide motion without cleavage of any coordination bonding (see
Fig. 17b). For example, CP {[Zn(tp)(bpy)0.5 ](DMF)(H2 O)0.5 }n (20a)
of 2-fold interpenetrating 3D framework represents an open phase

1298

with the micropore size of 4 × 4 A˚ 2 , in which the solvent molecules
are included [121]. After dehydration, the resulting solvent-free
phase [Zn(tp)(bpy)0.5 ]n (20b) will be non-porous with the unit-cell
volume signiﬁcantly decreased. Furthermore, this structural conversion is reversible by soaking 20b in DMF-EtOH. Remarkably, the
ﬂexible nature of such a dynamic system will result in its application for separation of small molecules, such as n-pentane from
n-hexane and 2-methylbutane from n-pentane, as well as hysteresis of gas sorption.
3.2. pH condition
In some cases, the pH of a coordination assembled system
can also inﬂuence the crystalline product, probably in different
ways such as adjusting the existing forms and binding fashions
of carboxyl ligands, creating hydroxo bridges, and activating the
assembling reactions, etc. [18].
For example, the pH of the reaction solution is critical to
yield diverse products for the mixed-ligand CP system of CdII ,
3-bpo, and H3 sip [21]. In this case, two completely different
CPs {[Cd3 (sip)2 (3-bpo)2 (H2 O)6 ](H2 O)4.5 }n (21a) and {[Cd(sip)(3Hbpo)(H2 O)](H2 O)2 }n (21b) can be obtained at pH of ca. 2.5 and
4.0, respectively, which show the 2D layer and 1D tape polymeric
motifs. Notably, the pH of reaction solutions will be decreased
after crystallization ( pH ≈ 1 for 21a and 1.4 for 21b). A possible
explanation for this result is that the isolation of two such CPs incorporating the sip3− component will increase the concentration of
hydrogen ion in the mother liquor caused by the complete deprotonation of H3 sip. Of further importance, a similar pH effect is found
in the mixed-ligand coordination system of CdII , 4-bpo, and H3 sip,
but is not valid when other metal ions are present (CoII , NiII , and
PbII ), indicating its speciﬁc selectivity to CdII .
In comparison, such pH effects impose more signiﬁcant inﬂuences on coordination systems involving multicarboxylic acids as
ligands, which can be rationally realized by gradually adjusting
the deprotonation and binding modes of such tectons. For example, the assembly of H4 bptc, bpea, and CuII at pH values of 3,
4, and 7, respectively, can afford three different CPs [122]. The
CP [Cu(H2 bptc)(bpea)( 2 -H2 O)]n (22a) is isolated at a lower pH
value of 3, where the partly deprotonated 2 -H2 bptc ligands decorate the inﬁnite metal–water chains that are pillared by the
bpea ligands to form a 3D open framework (see Fig. 18a). When
the pH is increased to 4, {[Cu3 (Hbptc)2 (bpea)3 (H2 O)8 ](H2 O)4 }n
(22b) is formed, comprising two independent polymeric patterns
in the same crystal, i.e. 1D [Cu(bpea)(H2 O)4 ]n 2n+ chain and 2D
[Cu2 (Hbptc)2 (bpea)2 (H2 O)4 ]n 2n− layer, where the Hbptc ligands
connect the CuII ions as tridentate linkers. The two types of motifs
take an alternate stacking fashion in the lattices with a sequence of

and bpea with CuII . (a) pH 3, 3D open rhombic framework in 22a. (b) pH 4, stacking

ABAB to construct a 3D sandwich-like architecture (see Fig. 18b). By
further increasing the pH to 7, {[Cu2 (bptc)(bpea)2 (H2 O)](H2 O)6.5 }n
(22c) can be obtained. In contrast to 22a and 22b, the completely
deprotonated bptc ligand in 22c takes a 4-connected mode, with
two carboxylates in bidentate chelating and the other two in
unidentate binding. Thus, the CuII centers are extended by both
bptc and bpea connectors to result in a quite complicated 3D selfinterpenetrating network (see Fig. 18c).
3.3. Metal ion
As one of the most common factors inﬂuencing the assembly of
CPs, in contrast to those well-designed and versatile organic tectons, metal ions can be viewed as a family of controllable building
blocks [123]. That is, one particular metal element with a given
valence normally deﬁnes its intrinsic coordination preference and
geometry [124–126].
In this context, a series of mixed-ligand CPs have been prepared
under diffusion condition, by assembling NiII , ZnII , AgI , CdII , CuII , or
PbII nitrate with H2 tbtp and 4-bpo [127]. These CPs display various
1D to 3D structural patterns with different coordination geometries
of the metal ions, clearly indicating the metal-directed assembly.
In the NiII , ZnII , AgI , and CdII CPs, though the metal centers take
different coordination numbers (6 and 7) and geometries (octahedral and pentagonal-bipyramidal), they are invariably bridged by
the tbtp ligands to afford 1D polymeric chains, with the uniden-

exhibit 2D corrugated layers. With regard to the CdII CP, the distorted pentagonal-bipyramidal CdII centers are extended via the
Htma bridges to produce a 1D linear array with 4,4 -abpt decorating
on one side as the terminal ligands.
3.4. Synthetic route
Interestingly, different crystalline products of CPs can be
obtained from the same reactants using distinct synthetic routes
such as room-temperature solvent evaporation, layered-diffusion,
and hydrothermal synthesis, etc. In this regard, some representative examples on the controlled preparation of CPs through
different synthetic pathways have been illustrated [129]. For
mixed-ligand CPs, hydrothermal reactions of ZnII with bpy and
H2 nip at 140 ◦ C and 180 ◦ C produce a 1D ribbon chain and a 2D layer,
respectively [130,131]. Under the layered-diffusion route, another
CP can be obtained, showing a 2D double layered structure [132].
Assemblies of ZnII nitrate with mixed ligands 4-bpo and H2 tbtp
using layered-diffusion or directly mixing route with solvent evaporation afford two distinct CPs with 1D chain and 2D layer patterns
[127]. Assembly of CdII with 4,4 -abpt and H3 tma, using two synthetic routes such as solvent evaporation at room temperature and
the hydrothermal reaction, yields a pair of different CPs with 2D
layers and 1D chain structures, respectively [128].
4. Construction of speciﬁc CPs with mixed ligands
4.1. Unusual topological networks

tate 4-bpo tectons decorating as pendant arms (see Fig. 19a). For
the CuII CP, the CuII center adopts a distorted square-pyramidal
sphere, and both the 4-bpo and tbtp ligands connect the CuII ions
as bidentate bridges to form a (4,4) coordination layer (see Fig. 19b).
When the post-transition PbII ion with an identiﬁable void for
ligand disposition (namely, inert-pair effect) is employed, a distinct 3D CP is constructed. In this structure, the PbII centers show
distorted tetrahedral coordination spheres, which are connected
by 4-bpo and tbtp ligands to afford a 3D dia open framework with
1D channels of ca. 14.1 × 11.6 A˚ 2 . Thus, each network is ﬁlled via
catenation with two other networks to construct a 3-fold interpenetrating architecture (see Fig. 19c). In another case, reactions of
4,4 -abpt and H3 tma with different metal salts (CoII , NiII , and CdII )
yield a series of new CPs under hydrothermal conditions [128]. In
the CoII and NiII CPs, due to the similar octahedral coordination
of metal centers, the resulting networks are isostructural and

Network topology is an important and essential aspect for the
analysis and design of CPs and also of inherent signiﬁcance for
understanding the assembling laws therein. Towards this direction,
complicated crystalline lattices can be appropriately simpliﬁed to
equivalent node-and-rod nets, and new insights into engineering
strategy of CPs are possible on the basis of topological consideration
[6]. In mixed-ligand CP systems, new or unusual network topologies are of special focus, in virtue of the diverse connectivity of
mixed ligands in structural construction.
Assemblies of the ﬂexible ligand bpp and CoII with the isophthalate derivatives H2 mip and H2 tbip lead to two unique 4and 6-connected 2D networks [133]. In [Co2 (mip)2 (bpp)2 (H2 O)]n
(23a), both [Co2 (COO)4 ] dimers and discrete CoII centers can
be regarded as 4-connecting nodes, which are interconnected
by mip and bpp bridges to afford an unusual 2D network (see
Fig. 20a) with the Schläﬂi symbol (4.64 .8)2 (42 .64 ). Whereas in
[Co2 (tbip)2 (H2 tbip)(bpp)(H2 O)]n (23b), two types of similar but
independent [Co2 ( -COO)2 ( -H2 O)] SBUs are connected by the
dicarboxyl and bpp linkers to give a uninodal 6-connected 2D
bilayer network with the Schläﬂi symbol (33 .410 .5.6) (see Fig. 20b).
To complicate the connectivity of organic tectons and further the resulting CP networks, aromatic multicarboxylic acids
with suitable spacers can be used. For example, hydrothermal
reactions of MnII acetate with H3 nbtc and different bipyridine ligands (bpy, bpea, and bpp) yield a series of 2D and
3D CPs [90]. In {[Mn3 (nbtc)2 (bpy)3 (H2 O)2 ](H2 O)2 }n (24a), the
nbtc ligands can be simpliﬁed as 4-connected nodes, which
interlink the 4- and 5-connected MnII nodes with the aid
of bpy bridges to construct a 3D (4,5)-connected network,
with the Schläﬂi symbol (42 .67 .8)(64 .82 )(42 .64 ). When the rigid
bpy rod is replaced by the ﬂexible bpea tecton, a 2D CP
{[Mn3 (nbtc)2 (bpea)(H2 O)5 ](bpea)0.5 (H2 O)}n (24b) is obtained,
where the 4 - and 5 -nbtc anions serve as the 4- and 5connected nodes to afford a very complicated (3,4,5)-connected
network with two types of 3-connected MnII ions. In another CP
[Mn3 (nbtc)2 (bpp)2 (H2 O)4 ]n (24c), each nbtc anion is linked to four
metal centers and can be regarded as a 4-connected node. In com-

and (b) 6-connected 2D bilayer topology in 23b [133].

bination with the 3-connected MnII ions, a layered (3,4)-connected
network with (42 .6)(42 .63 .8) topology is constructed, with the
unidentate bpp ligands decorating at two sides.
4.2. Entangled networks
Entanglement represents one of the most typical structural
styles of supramolecular architectures. Compared with the familiar interpenetrating patterns, the self-penetrating networks that
can be considered as the polymeric equivalent of molecular
knots, are much less known at present [105,134–137]. Of particular interest, such intriguing networks are readily constructed
by using the mixed-ligand strategy, due to both ﬂexibility and
multi-connectivity of different ligands involved within the same
framework [138–140].
The ﬂuorinated H2 tfpbbp ligand has been applied to construct
ZnII coordination networks with isophthalate co-tectons [106], as
a promising ﬂexible bidentate building block to design entangled
patterns. Reactions of H2 tfpbbp and ZnII with H2 ip or H2 mip produce two isostructural CPs, showing the unprecedented 2-fold
interpenetrating architecture of 3D self-penetrating nets. In detail,
the H2 tfpbbp pillars are inclined to interlink the 2D [Zn(ip)]n or
[Zn(mip)]n layers into a rare mab framework of (44 .610 .8) topology
with self-penetrating feature. Remarkably, each self-penetrating
mab net possesses large voids to facilitate the formation of a 2fold interpenetrating lattice (see Fig. 21a). However, when similar
dicarboxyl tectons H2 ﬁp or H2 nip are used instead, the resulting

Fig. 21. Schematic representation of (a) two interpenetrating mab networks, each of
which is also a self-interpenetrating pattern, and (b) 3-fold parallel interpenetration
of hcb layers with polyrotaxane character [106].

CPs have distinct 2D hcb networks with both 3-fold interpenetration and polyrotaxane characteristics. Each hexagonal subunit
of the hcb layer consists of four ﬁp or nip bridges and two doubly bridged H2 tfpbbp loops, which provide the suitable spaces for
holding the rods from other two layers and thus result in a parallel
interpenetration with the features of a polyrotaxane (see Fig. 21b).
4.3. Chiral networks
Stable chiral CPs are currently of special interest owing to
their promising applications in enantioselective sorption, separation, and catalysis. Generally, there are two eligible approaches
to achieve such chiral crystalline materials, namely using a chiral
tecton as the primary linker or auxiliary co-ligand, and using the
achiral building blocks via spontaneous resolution [141].
Construction of chiral coordination assemblies with achiral
ligands can also be realized by chiral induction, that is, to induce
chirality of the crystal products via the external stimulator, usually
chemical in nature [141]. In general, such a strategy may be
accomplished using chiral solvents (organic solvent and ionic
liquid) [142,143] or chiral additive agents [144,145], which may
provide particularly weak interactions, such as solvent–solvate
contacts, van der Waals forces, hydrogen bonds, and ␲· · ·␲ stacking, etc. However, the origin of most supramolecular chirality
in CPs is so far ambiguous. For instance, using the achiral mixed

M. Du et al. / Coordination Chemistry Reviews 257 (2013) 1282–1305

ligands H3 btc and tib and controlling the pH of the reaction
generates a pair of unique 3d-3d heterometallic CPs [146].
{[Zn2 Co(tib)3 (H2 O)5 ][Zn6 (tib)2 (btc)6 ](H2 O)12.7 }n (25a) isolated
at pH 8–9 crystallizes in the hexagonal space group P63 and
consists of two separated 2D fragments, which are arranged in an
ABCD stacking fashion with the cationic and anionic layers in an
alternating location. However, {[ZnCo(tib)(btc)(H2 O)2 ]Cl(H2 O)3 }n
(25b) prepared at pH 5–6 crystallizes in space group P21 21 21 and
features a chiral binodal 3-connected framework of (122 .14)(123 )
topology, where the 1D helical chains and the 1D achiral chains
are arranged alternately. Elsewhere, the use of 1-butyl-3-methyl
imidazolium L-asp as solvent and/or template to synthesize chiral
compounds undoubtedly reveals its chiral induction effect [142].
Conceptually, the easiest way to achieve a chiral crystalline solid
is to use a chiral component as a starting point. Especially in mixedligand CP systems, the combination of pyridine derived ligand and
amino acid represents an effective method to obtain the targeted
chiral crystals. For example, the solvothermal reaction of NiII , L-asp,
and bpy produces a chiral open framework material [147], in which
the chiral [Ni(L-asp)]n layers are extended by the achiral bpy linkers
to form a pillared 3D structure with 1D channels for guest accommodation. Interestingly, careful control over the water/methanol
ratio results in an achiral structure, caused by the racemization of
starting amino acid at a higher concentration of water. In another
case, three isoreticular homochiral porous CPs can be readily prepared from ZnII , (+)-H2 cam, and rigid linear N-donor spacers, such
as dabco, bpy, and bpee [148]. The lengths of these linear ligands
will modulate the pore sizes and free accessible volumes of the
homochiral CPs. Other chiral mixed-ligand CPs with H2 cam have
also been reported [149,150].
Recently, Chen and co-workers have developed a metalloligand or pre-constructed building block approach to construct
the enantiopure mixed-ligand CPs, that is, using chiral Msalen metalloligands and M -dicarboxylates units to obtain the
targeted chiral materials (see Scheme 20) [151]. The hydrothermal reactions of the chiral metalloligand Cu(SalPyCy)
with Zn(NO3 )2 and H2 tp or H2 cdc can readily form the
chiral CPs {[Zn3 (tp)3 ][Cu(SalPyCy)](DMF)5 (H2 O)4 }n (26a) or
{[Zn3 (cdc)3 ][Cu(SalPyCy)](DMF)5 (H2 O)4 }n (26b). In both structures, the [Zn3 (COO)6 ] SBUs are connected by tp or cdc anions to
afford the 36 tessellated [Zn3 (tp)3 ]n or [Zn3 (cdc)3 ]n sheets, which
are further pillared by Cu(SalPyCy) building blocks to construct
the isostructural chiral 3D frameworks involving two chiral pore

solids 26a and 26b show a highly selective separation of C2 H2
and C2 H4 (1.6 vs 25.5) and the enantioselective separation of S1-phenylethyl alcohol (ee = 21% vs 64%), indicating their potential
applications in practical adsorption-based separation.
5. Physiochemical properties and applications
Many well-designed CPs with mixed-ligand tectons show fascinating physiochemical properties, such as adsorption, separation,
magnetism, optics, conductivity, and catalysis, etc. [152–157].

Notably, herein we mainly focus on the representative CPs which
show the obvious changes of material properties concomitant with
the delicate modiﬁcation of the mixed-ligand building components,
in order to explore further the potential structure–property correlation of CPs based on the mixed-ligand synthetic strategy.
5.1. Gas adsorption and separation
The delicate control and tuning of small pore or window sizes
for the open frameworks of CPs is crucial to achieve highly effective storage and separation of guest molecules by the size-exclusion
effect, in which the small substrates can go through the pore channels. In this regard, a simple strategy to construct the desired channels or cavities of coordination networks by regulating the types of
mixed-ligand components is of particular interest and signiﬁcance.
Hydrothermal reactions of CuII nitrate with H2 fma
and three comparable bipyridine linkers (pyz, bpy, and
bpee) result in similar 3D primitive cubic frameworks
[Cu(fma)(pyz)0.5 ]n (27a), {[Cu(fma)(bpy)0.5 ](H2 O)0.25 ]}n (27b),
and {[Cu(fma)(bpee)0.5 ](H2 O)0.5 }n (27c), which are doubly
interpenetrating [158]. The void spaces in these CPs can be systematically tuned, simply by modifying the bipyridine pillars. Of
further interest, CP 27c shows selective gas adsorption behavior.
In fact, the 2.0 × 3.2 A˚ 2 pores in 27c are larger than the size of
˚ but smaller than those of N2 (3.64 A)
˚ and CO (3.64 A).

Thus, it exhibits signiﬁcant selectivity of H2 uptake over CO and

˚ at 195 K (see Fig. 22b). Notably, owing to the
over CH4 (3.8 A)
structural ﬂexibility, such a microporous material also shows
different hysteresis sorption behaviors with respect to H2 , N2 , CO2 ,
and CH4 .
A series of mixed-ligand CPs are built from the robust
[Zn2 (COO)4 ] paddle-wheel subunits and three different dicarboxylate linkers (H2 fma, H2 tp, and 2,6-H2 ndc) to deﬁne the perforated
2D layers, which are further pillared by the bpy rods to form 3D
open coordination frameworks with the inclusion of solvents [159].
For the desolvated samples, only tp-involved CP exhibits signiﬁcant N2 adsorption behavior with an approximate type I Langmuir
isotherm and the BET surface area of 660 m2 /g. Similar examples of
the mixed-ligand microporous CPs with adjustable gas adsorption
have also been reported [160–162].
Of further interest, some ﬂexible mixed-ligand CPs possess
voids that are too small to allow guest entrance, which however
may exhibit a gate-opening character to expand for gas adsorption. In this regard, the 2D CP {[Cu2 (dhbc)2 (bpy)](H2 O)}n with
2-fold interdigitated pattern undergoes a drastic crystal transformation triggered by desorption of water guest to result in a
cell-volume contraction [163]. Actually, such a structural change
is accompanied by a shrinking of the layer gap arising from the
glide motion of two dhbc moieties, which leads to a decrease of
the channel cross-section. When exposing the dehydrated solid
to N2 vapor at the gate-opening pressure, structural re-expansion
is reversibly observed. Notably, this CP shows characteristic hysteresis adsorption isotherms, with different gate-opening and
gate-closing pressures for CO2 and other super critical gases (CH4 ,
O2 , and N2 ).
Similar gate-open adsorption phenomena are also observed
in [Cu2 (pzdc)2 (bpg)]n which is constructed by the bridging pzdc
ligands and ﬂexible bpg linkers. Signiﬁcantly, with regard to the
gate-opening process herein, H-bonding is the critical driving
force. In this case, the 2D [Cu2 (pzdc)2 ]n layers are pillared by the
bpg ligands to form a 3D network with 1D narrow channels, in
which the hydroxyl groups of bpg are exposed to form H-bonding
with the guests [164]. From the adsorption isotherms of MeOH and
H2 O vapors as well as CH4 at 298 K, a speciﬁc adsorption of MeOH
or H2 O will occur under the proper pressure, whereas CH4 cannot
be adsorbed. Moreover, the desorption isotherm does not trace
the adsorption isotherm, which indicates a dynamic structural
transformation of the framework. Therefore, this selective adsorption can be primarily associated with the H-bonding interactions
between MeOH or H2 O molecules and hydroxyl groups of the bpg
ligands.

carboxylate bridges (28a and 28b) and antiferromagnetic exchange
through pyz (28a) or bpy (28b) linkers. However, the corrugated
malonate-bridged CuII layers in {[Cu4 (mal)4 (bpee)3 ](H2 O)6 }n (28c)
are extended by the bis-unidentate bpee ligands to afford a 3D coordination network [166]. The CuII ions in the layers are bridged by
a double -oxo and four carboxylato-malonate linkers, which will
induce an overall ferromagnetic behavior.
Two 3D mixed-ligand NiII CPs can be obtained from H2 nndc
and the comparable bipyridine ligands (bpy and bpee), where the
mother framework [Ni(nndc)]n is ﬂexible enough to be pillared by
different auxiliary co-ligands [167]. Remarkably, the variation of
ligands from bpy to bpee will not inﬂuence the network topology
but result in a signiﬁcant magnetic transformation from metamagnetism to paramagnetism (see Fig. 23). This illustrates a nice
example for controlling the magnetic behavior of mixed-ligand CPs.
In another case, a family of MnII CPs are prepared from the mixed
ligands bpy and three comparable aliphatic acids (H2 suc, H2 glu, and
H2 adi), showing a 3D open framework (29a), 2D layer (29b), and
2-fold interpenetrating 3D architecture (29c), respectively [168].
Interestingly, the antiferromagnetic interactions between MnII ions
in 29a–29c will be stronger when the spacer lengths of aliphatic
acids are increased.
5.3. Catalysis

5.2. Magnetism
Due to the complexity and difﬁculty in controlling the organic
magnetic carriers [154], the rational design and construction of
mixed-ligand magnetic CPs still remains a great challenge, in contrast to that of pure inorganic and other organic–inorganic hybrid
materials with simpler magnetic bridges. However, this strategy
will also result in diverse CP magnetic behaviors, which, in some
cases, may be well regulated by proper modiﬁcation of the ligand
components.
Assemblies of CuII and H2 mma with pyz or bpy produce two
3D CPs, [Cu2 (mmal)2 (pyz)]n (28a) and [Cu2 (mmal)2 (bpy)(H2 O)2 ]n
(28b), respectively [165]. The structures of both CPs are similar, composed of corrugated layers of CuII (28a) and water–CuII
(28b) units with intralayer methylmalonate bridges in anti–syn
(equatorial–apical) coordination mode and additional pyz or bpy
pillars. Magnetic susceptibility measurements of 28a and 28b in
the temperature range of 2–300 K reveal the occurrence of two
types of magnetic interactions: ferromagnetic coupling through the

Although CPs still cannot completely replace inorganic materials, such as the classical molecular sieves and zeolites in catalysis,
CPs can be considered as the good candidates for ﬁne organic synthesis and enantioselective catalysis under mild conditions [169].
Generally, the CP catalytic activity may originate from the open
metal sites, reactive functional groups, and host matrices or nanometric reaction cavities [170]. For example, three 3D CPs with
CoII , NiII , and ZnII as active metal sites can be prepared based on
the mixed ligands H2 oba and bpy [82]. The various metal polyhedra of Co4 N trigonal-bipyramid, NiO4 N2 octahedron, and ZnO4
tetrahedron or ZnO3 N2 trigonal-bipyramid facilitate their different
photocatalytic activities for degradation of some organic dyes, such
as orange G, rhodamine B, Remazol Brilliant Blue R, and methylene blue (see Fig. 24). Further, by introducing U5 O14 units into
the NiII mixed-ligand CP with H2 pydc and bpy, a 3D microporous
hybrid material showing photocatalytic activity for degradation of
methyl blue as a model pollutant [171], can be obtained under
hydrothermal conditions.

The pillared-layer CPs [Cu2 (pzdc)2 (L)]n (L = pyz, 30a; bpy, 30b;
bpee, 30c) have similar 1D channels of different sizes of 4.0 × 6.0,
8.2 × 6.0, and 10.3 × 6.0 A˚ 2 , respectively, within which the carboxylate oxygen atoms of pzdc display Lewis basic nature to serve
as speciﬁc adsorption sites for alkynes, leading to the realization of
anionic polymerization [172,173]. For instance, methyl propiolate
will polymerize inside the channels of 30b upon standing at room
temperature, and the structure of CP is preserved before and
after polymerization. Further, the poly(methyl propiolate) can
be recovered from the CP by extracting the solid with DMF at
353 K. The polymer displays mostly a trans-conﬁguration of the
C = C double bonds. Of further importance, such a polymerization
reaction suffers a spatial conﬁnement effect. That is, the reaction
cavities provided by these CPs with a precise arrangement of
carboxylate oxygen donors and the proper adsorption sites for
different acetylene monomers (acetylene or methyl propiolate)
is responsible for the successful polymerization, by enabling the
strong interaction between the monomer and carboxylate.

6. Conclusion
The aim of this review is to present a brief summary to examine the broad relationship between the nature of each type of
ligand component in the mixed-ligand CP systems and the structures and properties of the resulting polymeric architectures, in
order to portray a guideline for the design of organic tectons and
further the targeted crystalline solids. In this direction, the most
effective approach for structural construction of mixed-ligand CPs
is to combine both acid and base ligands within the same assembled
system, rather than the acid–acid or base–base system. Further,
the design of organic tectons is mostly practiced by modifying
the ligand backbones containing carboxyl, pyridine, diazolyl, and
triazolyl functional groups. Moreover, the mixed-ligand synthetic
strategy will be highly affected by the spacer effect, positional isomeric effect, and substituent effect of either type of organic ligands,
as well as some other factors including solvent, pH, metal ion, and
synthetic route. These can establish an essential methodology for
