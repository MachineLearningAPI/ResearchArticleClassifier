SUMMARY

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of noncoding RNAs
that regulate target gene expression at the posttranscriptional level. Here, we report that secreted
miRNAs can serve as signaling molecules mediating
intercellular communication. In human blood cells
and cultured THP-1 cells, miR-150 was selectively
packaged into microvesicles (MVs) and actively
secreted. THP-1-derived MVs can enter and deliver
miR-150 into human HMEC-1 cells, and elevated
exogenous miR-150 effectively reduced c-Myb
expression and enhanced cell migration in HMEC-1
cells. In vivo studies confirmed that intravenous injection of THP-1 MVs significantly increased the level of
miR-150 in mouse blood vessels. MVs isolated from
the plasma of patients with atherosclerosis contained
higher levels of miR-150, and they more effectively
promoted HMEC-1 cell migration than MVs from
healthy donors. These results demonstrate that cells
can secrete miRNAs and deliver them into recipient
cells where the exogenous miRNAs can regulate
target gene expression and recipient cell function.

INTRODUCTION
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of noncoding RNAs consisting of
processed products approximately 22 nucleotides in length that
regulate gene expression in plants and animals (Ambros, 2004;
Bartel, 2004). In a previous study, we showed that miRNAs are
stably expressed in animal serum/plasma and that their unique
expression patterns serve as ‘‘fingerprints’’ of various diseases

(Chen et al., 2008). Mitchell et al. and two other groups reported
that circulating miRNAs are promising biomarkers for prostate
cancer, pregnancy, and ovarian cancer (Mitchell et al., 2008; Gilad
et al., 2008; Resnick et al., 2009). By characterizing serum miRNA
expression profiles under normal physiological conditions and in
various disease states, we found that serum miRNAs are derived
not only from circulating blood cells but also from other tissues
directly affected by disease (Chen et al., 2008). Interestingly, unlike
miRNAs extracted from tissues or cells, miRNAs extracted from
sera are resistant to RNase A digestion (Chen et al., 2008), suggesting that serum miRNAs might be modified differently from tissue or
cellular miRNAs. Although it has been speculated that serum
miRNA may be released from broken cells (Mitchell et al., 2008),
the mechanisms that regulate miRNA release and the potential biological functions of serum miRNAs are completely unknown.
Microvesicles (MVs) are small vesicles that are shed from
almost all cell types under both normal and pathological conditions (Cocucci et al., 2008; The´ry et al., 2002). These secreted
MVs bear surface receptors/ligands of the original cells and
have the potential to selectively interact with specific target cells
(The´ry et al., 2002). Cell-derived MVs may thus be ideal miRNA
carriers and may also provide a mechanism for transport and
exchange of miRNAs among nonadjacent cells. Recent studies
identified miRNAs in different types of MVs derived from cultured
cells (Skog et al., 2008; Valadi et al., 2007), supporting the idea that
MVs, particularly exosomes, may serve as physiological carriers
of miRNAs. Although Skog et al. (2008) described the expression
profile of miRNAs in MVs derived from glioblastoma cells and Valadi et al. (2007) demonstrated the regulation of target genes in
recipient cells by exosomes, there is no direct evidence to show
that exogenous miRNAs delivered by MVs regulate the expression
of target genes and cellular functions in recipient cells. Because
MVs also contain proteins and other nucleotides (The´ry et al.,
2002; Skog et al., 2008; Valadi et al., 2007), their effects on recipient cells might be caused by molecules other than miRNAs.

Secreted miRNAs in Signal Transduction

Furthermore, while there is no report of a possible carrier of serum
miRNA, it is important to understand the potential mechanism of
action of serum miRNA.
In this study, we further examine the sources of serum miRNAs
and show that cells can selectively package miRNAs into MVs
and actively secrete them into the circulation and into cell culture
medium. We also demonstrate that these secreted miRNAs can
be delivered into target cells and can modulate the biological
functions of these cells via repression of target gene expression.
RESULTS
MVs Derived from Human Plasma and Cultured THP-1
Cells Contain miRNAs
In order to determine whether MVs are carriers of circulating
miRNA, MVs were obtained from human plasma of healthy donors
by sequential centrifugation (detailed experimental procedure is
shown in a schematic diagram in Figure S5). Under electron
microscopy, the isolated MVs appeared as cluster of vesicles of
40–200 nm in diameter, and each of those vesicles was surrounded by a double-layer membrane (Figures 1A–1C). They contained various miRNAs (Figure 1D). Using OptiPrep-based density
gradient centrifugation, the MVs were separated into three
fractions based on density in the range of 0.98–1.19 g/ml.
All three fractions of MVs (0.98–1.01, 1.02–1.12, and 1.13–
1.19 g/ml) contained miRNAs; the fraction with the highest density
(1.13–1.19 g/ml) had the highest concentration of miRNAs (lower
CT value) (Figure 1E). The ratio of miRNA levels in MVs to that in
MV-free plasma was compared. The majority of circulating
miRNAs were present in MVs (Figure 1F). miR-150, miR-16, and
miR-1 were mainly stored in MVs, whereas miR-25, miR-181a,
miR-223, and miR-451 were present at relatively higher levels in
MV-free plasma (Figure 1F). Furthermore, MVs isolated from
culture medium of THP-1 cells were characterized. They were
identified by their morphologically uniform vesicular structure in
electron microscopy (around 30–60 nm) (Figure 1G) and by exosomal marker protein CD63 (Figure 1H). MVs derived from cultured
THP-1 cells also contained various miRNAs, including monocytic
miR-150 (Figure 1I). Interestingly, such vesicles also contain some
proteins required for miRNA activity, such as Argonaute 2 (AGO2)
(Gibbings et al., 2009), albeit less than that in whole-cell lysates
(Figure 1H). These results show that MVs derived from both
plasma and cultured cells contain miRNAs and suggest that
MVs may be the major carriers of circulating miRNAs.
To further characterize the miRNAs in MVs, we established
a method to calculate the absolute expression levels of miRNAs
in MVs. Using diluted synthetic miRNA as template, we first
showed that our quantitative RT-PCR assay was able to monitor
miRNA levels specifically and sensitively (Figure S1A). To validate that our method of normalizing miRNA expression to total
protein content among MVs is reasonable, a series of MVs
(1/1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, or 1/32) were subjected to quantitative

RT-PCR to analyze miRNA levels. Simultaneously, BCA method
was employed to quantify total protein content in MVs.
Decreasing the MV input led to a corresponding decrease in
the levels of both miRNAs (Figure S1B) and proteins
(Figure S1C), with a Pearson correlation coefficient (R) between
miRNA and protein levels close to 1 (Figures S1D and S1E). The
results suggest that our method is an accurate and reproducible
tool to analyze miRNA expression in MVs. By this method, we
demonstrated that the miRNAs were indeed present within the
MVs but not simply being released as a contaminant during the
MV purification process, as the miRNA expression levels in
MVs treated with RNase were little changed compared to those
in untreated MVs, while miRNA levels in MVs treated with both
RNase and Triton X-100 significantly reduced (Figure 1J).

Blood Cells and Cultured THP-1 Cells Selectively
Package miRNAs into MVs in Response to Various
Stimuli
In order to assess the specificity of cellular secretion of miRNAs,
miRNAs present in MVs derived from LPS-treated human blood
cells were analyzed. When normalized to total protein content,
miR-150 and other immune-related miRNAs, including miR-146a
and miR-181a, were markedly upregulated in MVs derived from
LPS-treated blood compared to those from untreated blood
(Figure 2A). In contrast, other miRNAs, such as miR-122 and
miR-124a, were unchanged in MVs in response to LPS stimulation
(Figure 2A). Cultured THP-1 cells were used for further study. The
absolute expression levels of miRNAs in untreated THP-1 MVs
were determined (Figure 2B). The most highly enriched miRNA in
THP-1 MVs was miR-150, which was present at a concentration
of approximately 0.002 pmol/mg total protein). The levels of various
miRNAs in MVs were generally 0.02%–0.5% of their cellular
contents (Table S1). THP-1 cells were then stimulated with LPS,
oleic acid (OA)/palmitic acid (PA), advanced glycation end products (AGEs), and H2O2. LPS not only stimulated the release of
MVs from THP-1 cells (Figure S2), which is consistent with
a previous report (Aras et al., 2004), but also altered the types
and levels of miRNAs in THP-1 MVs (data not shown). Furthermore,
although OA/PA, AGEs, and H2O2 affected the expression pattern
and levels of miRNAs both in cells (Figures 2F–2H) and in MVs
(Figures 2C–2E), MVs showed remarkably greater changes in their
specific miRNA content than overall cells did. While certain stimulations increased miR-30d, miR-26a, miR-26b, miR-29a, miR181b, and miR-222 levels in THP-1 MVs, all three stimuli caused
a significant elevation of miR-150 levels in secreted MVs (Figures
2C–2E). A summary of the alteration of miRNAs in MVs and cells
in response to three stimuli is listed in Table S2. These results
clearly demonstrate that blood cells and cultured THP-1 cells
actively and selectively package miRNAs into MVs and secrete
them into the circulation or the culture medium in response to
various stimuli.

(J) Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of miRNAs in MVs treated with RNase or Triton X-100. MVs were isolated from culture medium of THP-1 cells and divided into
three equal portions. These samples were then untreated (control) or treated with RNase or RNase plus 0.1% Triton X-100 for 30 min. Quantitative RT-PCR assay
was performed to determine the retained miRNAs in each sample. Results are presented as means ±SEM of three independent experiments (see also Figure S1).

THP-1 MVs Deliver miRNAs into Recipient HMEC-1 Cells
To determine the biological functions of secreted miRNAs,
cultured human microvascular endothelial HMEC-1 cells were
used as the recipients of MVs derived from THP-1 cells. DiIC16-labeled MVs isolated from THP-1 cell culture medium
rapidly entered into the cultured HMEC-1 cells at 37 C
(Figure 3A). However, the internalization of MVs into HMEC-1
cells was blocked by incubation at 4 C (Figure 3A). A similar
process of internalization of MVs derived from 293T cells into
HMEC-1 cells was observed (Figures S3A and S3B). Interestingly, labeling of HMEC-1 cells by fluorescently labeled THP-1
MVs was dose dependent (Figures S3C and S3D). Furthermore,
if THP-1 cells were labeled with DiI-C16 for only 10 min, the isolated MVs did not label targeted HMEC-1 cells (Figure S3E).
This result was not unexpected, since only a very limited
amount of labeled MVs was secreted in such a short time
frame. These results demonstrate that labeling HMEC-1 cells
is not due to DiI-C16 carryover but to the internalization of
MVs into targeted cells, which is an active process depending
on temperature, incubation time, and the amount of MVs.
Together, our results show that every cell type tested can act
as a recipient of MVs secreted by human monocyte/macrophage cells.
Subsequently, we directly fluorescently tagged a synthetic
miRNA oligonucleotide (FITC-tagged miR-150) and transfected
it into THP-1 cells. Figures S3F–S3H showed that the FITCtagged miR-150 was efficiently transfected into THP-1 cells.
We then isolated MVs from THP-1 cell culture medium, added
the MVs to HMEC-1 cells, and looked for the fluorescently
labeled oligonucleotide in the HMEC-1 cells. Figure 3B showed
that HMEC-1 cells treated with MVs bearing FITC-tagged miR150 were fluorescently labeled under fluorescence microscopy
(indicated by arrows). By flow cytometry, uptake and retention
of the FITC-tagged miR-150 in HMEC-1 cells was demonstrated
(Figure 3C). These results clearly demonstrate that miRNAs can
be secreted and delivered into target cells via MVs.
miR-150, a leukocyte- and lymphocyte-specific miRNA, was
abundantly expressed in THP-1 cells (Figure 3D, left panel)
and THP-1-derived MVs (Figure 2B). In contrast, HMEC-1 cells
and 293T cells had significantly lower levels of miR-150
(Figure 3D, left panel). Figure 3E also showed that miR-150
was enriched in THP-1 cells and THP-1 MVs. THP-1 MVs
increased miR-150 levels in HMEC-1 cells nearly 12-fold, while
MVs derived from control 293T cells had no effect on the level
of miR-150 expression in HMEC-1 cells (Figure 3D, right panel).
On the other hand, 293T MVs contained high levels of miR-24*

(Figure 3D, left panel), and miR-24* was elevated in HMEC-1
cells when HMEC-1 cells were treated with 293T MVs
(Figure 3D, right panel). THP-1-derived MVs, which contained
low levels of miR-24*, had no effect on its expression in
HMEC-1 cells (Figure 3D, right panel). Moreover, increasing
the incubation time for uptake of THP-1 MVs led to a corresponding increase in miR-150 levels in HMEC-1 cells
(Figure S3I). The results strongly suggest that the uptake of
miR-150 into HMEC-1 cells is a kinetics process. The premiR-150 levels in HMEC-1 cells were unchanged by treatment
with either THP-1 or 293T MVs (Figure 3F), providing further
evidence that the increased miR-150 levels in HMEC-1 cells
were due to direct delivery by THP-1 MVs rather than to induction of miR-150 by cell-MV interactions. Taken together, these
results show that miR-150 was directly delivered to HMEC-1
cells by THP-1 MVs.
Exogenous miR-150 Reduces c-Myb Protein Level
in HMEC-1 Cells
The protein level of c-Myb, a gene targeted by miR-150 (Lin et al.,
2008; Xiao et al., 2007), was determined in order to assess the
biological function of exogenous miR-150 delivered by THP-1
MVs in HMEC-1 cells. As shown in Figure 3G, the expression level
of c-Myb in HMEC-1 cells was significantly reduced following
incubation with THP-1 MVs, while MVs from 293T cells had no
effect on c-Myb protein expression. In order to determine the
specificity of this effect and to exclude the possibility that the
decreased c-Myb protein was caused by factors other than
miR-150 in THP-1 MVs, the following experiments were performed. First, miR-150 expression was knocked down in THP-1
cells using antisense oligonucleotides. Efficient interference of
miR-150 was shown in Figures S3K and S3L. MVs from miR150-deficient THP-1 cells had no effect on c-Myb protein expression (Figure 3H). Second, HMEC-1 cells were directly treated with
pre-miR-150, anti-miR-150, or other unrelated miRNAs, followed
by assessment of c-Myb levels. Efficient overexpression of miR150 following transfection with pre-miR-150 is shown in Figures
S3J and S3L. Overexpression of miR-150 in HMEC-1 cells significantly decreased c-Myb expression. By contrast, treatment with
anti-miR-150 had almost no effect on c-Myb expression
(Figure 3H). This result was not unexpected, since the endogenous level of miR-150 in HMEC-1 cells is quite low. No apparent
effect of miR-16 overexpression on c-Myb level was seen
(Figure 3H). Third, 293T cells were transfected with pre-miR150, and MVs from miR-150-sufficient 293T cells were harvested.
Treatment with these MVs significantly decreased c-Myb

expression in HMEC-1 cells (Figure S3M). Finally, to demonstrate
the direct repression of c-Myb by THP-1 MVs through elements in
the 30 UTR, the entire c-Myb 30 UTR was cloned into a luciferase
reporter plasmid, and the resulting plasmid was transfected into
HMEC-1 cells combined with or without treatment of THP-1 MVs.
As shown in Figure S3N, the luciferase reporter activity was
significantly reduced following incubation with THP-1 MVs. In
contrast, MVs from miR-150-deficient THP-1 cells had no effect
on luciferase reporter activity. Taken together, the results
suggest that miR-150 secreted by THP-1 cells can effectively
get into HMEC-1 cells and reduce c-Myb expression in HMEC1 cells.

Exogenous miR-150 Enhances
Recipient HMEC-1 Cell Migration
As a transcription factor, c-Myb is critical
to various cellular functions, including
cell lineage commitment, proliferation, differentiation, and migration (Xiao et al.,
2007; Lin et al., 2008; Zhao et al., 2009; Kopecki et al., 2007).
The migration capacity of HMEC-1 cells following incubation
with THP-1 MVs was assessed. THP-1 MVs strongly enhanced
HMEC-1 cell migration across Transwell filters (Figure 4A). The
migration rate of HMEC-1 cells treated with THP-1 MVs was
about 2.5-fold higher than that of untreated cells or of cells treated
with 293T MVs (Figure 4B). Moreover, consistent with the
increased expression of miR-150 in THP-1 MVs upon exposure
to AGE (Figure 2D), the migration rate of HMEC-1 cells treated
with MVs isolated from AGE-stimulated THP-1 cells was higher
than that treated with unstimulated MVs (Figure S4A). Furthermore, miR-150-deficient THP-1 MVs had no effect on migration

of HMEC-1 cells (Figure 4C), while miR-150-sufficient 293T MVs
enhanced HMEC-1 cell migration (Figure S4B). HMEC-1 cells
were also directly treated with pre-miR-150, anti-miR-150, or
siRNA against c-Myb, followed by assessment of HMEC-1 migration. Elevated exogenous miR-150 in HMEC-1 cells significantly
enhanced cell migration (Figure 4C). Likewise, direct knockdown
of c-Myb in HMEC-1 cells by siRNA (efficient interference of cMyb expression was shown in Figures S4C and S4D) significantly
increased cell migration (Figure 4C). Taken together, these results
clearly demonstrate that secreted miRNAs present in MVs can be
effectively delivered to cultured cells, where they function as
endogenous miRNAs.
High Levels of Exogenous miR-150 from Plasma
of Patients with Atherosclerosis Enhance Recipient
HMEC-1 Cell Migration
The observation that miR-150 secreted by THP-1 cells can regulate HMEC-1 cell transmigration was further confirmed in an
in vivo study. DiI-C16-labeled MVs isolated from THP-1 cells
were injected intravenously into C57BL/6 mice, and the endothelium of mouse blood vessels was isolated and viewed by fluorescent microscopy. Figure 5A showed that the endothelium of
mouse blood vessels was fluorescently labeled (bright red dots
indicated by arrows). Moreover, THP-1 MVs were injected intravenously into C57BL/6 mice, and the expression levels of specific
miRNAs, especially miR-150, in mouse blood vessels were assessed. At 6 hr postinjection, miR-150 was upregulated in mouse
blood vessels, while injection of 293T MVs, which contain low
levels of miR-150, had no effect on its expression (Figure 5B).
These results suggest that secreted miRNAs present in MVs
can be delivered into target cells and tissues under physiological
conditions. Further, we found that MVs from atherosclerosis
patient plasma had an increased level of miR-150 (Figure 5C)
and that treatment of HMEC-1 cells with MVs from these patients
with high levels of miR-150 decreased c-Myb protein level and
enhanced cell migration (Figures 5D–5F). These results suggest
that elevated secreted miR-150 may play a role in regulating
endothelial cell function.
DISCUSSION
Since we have systematically discovered that miRNAs are stably
present in animal serum/plasma and can serve as a class of
biomarkers for cancers and other diseases (Chen et al., 2008),
a large number of studies have also reported that circulating
miRNAs can serve as biomarkers for various diseases (Resnick
et al., 2009; Ng et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2009). However, the biological and physiological functions of circulating miRNAs remain
completely unknown. Skog and coworkers (Skog et al., 2008)
showed that exosomes from cultured cells contain miRNAs, suggesting that cell-derived MVs might serve as efficient carriers for
delivery of circulating miRNAs. In the present study, we have
characterized the possible carrier of circulating miRNAs. Our
results suggest that MVs from whole human plasma are a mixture
of microparticles (diameter > 100 nm) (Simons and Raposo,
2009), exosomes (diameter around 40–100 nm, density in the
range of 1.13–1.19) (Simons and Raposo, 2009), and other vesicular structures and demonstrate that many types of MVs present

140 Molecular Cell 39, 133–144, July 9, 2010 ª2010 Elsevier Inc.

in plasma contain miRNAs. Unlike MVs present in plasma, MVs
released by cultured THP-1 cells are of uniform size, around
30–60 nm. It appears likely that MVs from cultured THP-1 cells
represent primarily exosome-like vesicles, a finding that concurs
with the findings of others (Cocucci et al., 2009; Simons and Raposo, 2009; Gibbings et al., 2009). We compared the ratio of
miRNA expression in MVs to that in MV-free plasma and found
that the majority of circulating miRNAs were present in MVs
(Figure 1F). Interestingly, not all miRNAs were enriched in MVs;
miR-223, miR-25, miR-451, and miR-181a showed relatively
higher levels in MV-free plasma. These results show that circulating miRNAs are not exclusively stored in secreted MVs. It will
be interesting to study the mechanisms that govern the release
of miRNAs from circulating blood cells and cultured cells in
further studies. However, in the present study, we focused on
investigation of the potential function of secreted miRNAs in MVs.
Selective packaging of miRNAs into MVs is crucial to the specificity of biological function of secreted miRNAs. If miRNAs are
released passively via broken cells, there would be no selection,
and the ratio of released miRNAs would be similar to that in the
cells. However, our results have demonstrated that cells selectively package miRNAs into MVs in circulating blood cells and
in cultured THP-1 cells under various stimuli (Figure 2). In circulating blood cells, LPS altered the types and levels of miRNAs in
MVs (Figure 2A), suggesting that blood cells selectively package
miRNAs into MVs. However, it is also possible that the change of
miRNA expression in MVs that we observed is due to a specific
type of cell in whole blood that responds strongly to LPS stimulation and nonselectively packages its specific miRNAs into
MVs. To rule out this possibility, we tested the profile change
of miRNAs in MVs derived from individual cell lines under
different stimuli. LPS, H2O2, AGEs, and OA/PA are classic acute
and chronic inflammatory factors that alter macrophage function
(Osterud and Bjorklid, 2003; Dale et al., 2008; Kashyap et al.,
2009; Mandrekar et al., 2009; Takahashi et al., 2009). All four
stimuli significantly altered miRNA types and levels in secreted
THP-1 MVs, and miRNA alteration in MVs (Figures 2C–2E) is
remarkably more significant than that in THP-1 cells (Figures
2F–2H). These results clearly demonstrate that cells can selectively package miRNA into MVs and actively secrete them into
circulation for specific functions. Because miRNAs can be
actively secreted by cells in response to various stimuli, our
results also suggest that it would be necessary to assess the
miRNAs both in cells and in secreted MVs when measuring alterations of miRNAs by stress factors. Furthermore, because the
release of certain miRNAs by monocytes/macrophages is
enhanced by various inflammatory stimuli, secreted miRNAs
from monocytes/macrophages may represent a class of inflammatory factors involved in the inflammatory process.
miR-150 is abundantly expressed in monocytes (Xiao et al.,
2007). It has been reported that this monocytic miRNA was
altered under various conditions, including the immune response
(Tsitsiou and Lindsay, 2009) and several diseases (Amaral et al.,
2009; Bruchova et al., 2008; Garzon and Croce, 2008; Ohlsson
Teague et al., 2009). miR-150 has also been reported to be
involved in cell proliferation, migration, differentiation, and
embryonic development (Xiao et al., 2007; Lin et al., 2008;
Kopecki et al., 2007). One of the target genes of miR-150 is

c-Myb, a transcription factor related to cell proliferation,
apoptosis, and tumorigenesis (Xiao et al., 2007). In this study,
we demonstrated that exogenous miR-150 delivered by MVs
from inflamed THP-1 cells or plasma of patients with severe
atherosclerosis downregulates c-Myb in recipient HMEC-1 cells
(Figures 3G, 3H, and 5D) and enhances HMEC-1 cell migration
(Figures 4, 5E, and 5F). A recent study by Gibbings et al. (2009)
showed that miRNAs could repress the mRNAs incorporated
into the exosomes. By tracing the THP-1 cell-secreted miR150 and characterizing its functional roles in HMEC-1 cells, our
results demonstrated that miRNAs in MVs can also alter the
gene in the target cells. This is direct evidence that a secreted
miRNA specifically regulates a biological function of the recipient
cells. Our results can therefore be taken to show that secreted
miRNAs in circulation have a great potential to become a class
of signaling molecules that mediate intercellular/interorgan
communication. Furthermore, given that miR-150 in MVs derived
from the plasma of patients with severe atherosclerosis downregulates c-Myb and enhances cell migration in recipient HMEC-1
cells and that the migration of endothelial cells lining blood
vessels is a major component of atherosclerosis, it appears likely
that elevated miR-150 levels in MVs could mediate crosstalk
between circulating monocytes/macrophages and vascular
endothelial cells under various pathophysiological conditions.
Such crosstalk mediated by miRNAs in MVs provides a mechanism that may underlie vascular injury under various dysfunctional conditions, including obesity, hyperglycemia, and chronic
inflammation.
Another interesting finding in the present study is that we have
observed an effective delivery of human miRNAs into murine
cells through cell-derived MVs. The results suggest a crossspecies delivery of miRNAs via MVs. However, the mechanism
underlying this cross-species delivery of miRNAs is completely
unknown. It is not clear whether the cross-species delivery of
miRNAs is specific and mediated by protein-protein interactions
or nonspecific and mediated by lipid-carbohydrate interactions.
Our observation of effective delivery of human miRNAs into
murine cells via MVs derived from various human cells may imply
that exosomes possess highly conserved ligands for conserved
receptors. However, although previous studies (The´ry et al.,
2006; Johnstone, 2006) show that exosomes derived from
different cell types do share many common properties, no
such conserved molecules that mediate the interactions
between exosomes and recipient cells have been identified yet.
Since their discovery in C. elegans 15 years ago, miRNAs have
been implicated in a wide array of cellular and developmental
processes (Ambros, 2004; Bartel, 2004). To date, more than
500 miRNAs are predicted to be expressed in humans, and
nearly 30% of genes are predicted to be regulated by miRNAs
(Ambros, 2004; Bartel, 2004). The present study extends our
understanding of the role of miRNAs by illustrating that miRNAs
can be secreted and delivered into target cells and that these
exogenous miRNAs can alter the cellular functions of the recipient cells by modulating the expression of their target genes.
From this point of view, secreted miRNAs may represent a class
of signaling molecules that play an important role in mediating
intercellular communication. Moreover, the secretion and targeting of miRNAs among the different cells establishes a highly

142 Molecular Cell 39, 133–144, July 9, 2010 ª2010 Elsevier Inc.

regulated complex network under various physiological and
pathophysiological conditions. Compared to classic cellular
communications mediated by hormone/cytokine-receptor and
antigen-antibody interactions that generally occur only in certain
types of cells, involve a single or few molecules, and affect target
cells in a ‘‘one-way’’ fashion, secreted miRNA-based cell
communication has the potential to function for every type of
cell, to deliver many types of miRNAs with each miRNA targeting
multiple genes, and to affect target cells in ‘‘two-way’’ or ‘‘multiway’’ fashion. Investigating this secreted miRNA-mediated shift
of cell communication from a ‘‘cable telephone’’ to ‘‘cell phone’’
fashion would help us to further understand the nature of biological signaling, discover novel mechanisms of disease, and
develop new therapeutic strategies.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Reagents, Cells, and Antibodies
The human monocyte/macrophage cell line THP-1 was purchased from China
Cell Culture Center (Shanghai, China); HMEC-1 cells were provided by E.W.
Ades (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; Atlanta). HMEC-1 cells
were grown in MCDB-131 (Invitrogen; Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with
10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (Becton Dickinson; San Jose, CA), 10
ng/ml hydrocortisone (Sigma Chemical, St. Louis), and 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS) (GIBCO; Carlsbad, CA). HMEC-1 cells were seeded on gelatin (Difco,
Detroit)-coated tissue culture plates or permeable Transwell filters (8.0 mm
pore size, Costar; Cambridge, MA). THP-1 cells were cultured in standard
RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS (GIBCO) in a 5% CO2,
water-saturated atmosphere. Anti-C-Myb (C19) and anti-GAPDH (6C5) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA).
Synthetic RNA molecules, including pre-miR-150, anti-miR-150, and scrambled negative control oligonucleotides (pre-ncRNA and anti-ncRNA), were
purchased from Ambion (Austin, TX).
Blood Collection
Method for collecting blood is described in the Supplemental Experimental
Procedures.
MV Isolation
MVs were isolated from the plasma of healthy donors or of patients with
atherosclerosis and from cell culture medium by differential centrifugation
according to previous publications (Skog et al., 2008; Valadi et al., 2007).
As shown in the schematic description of the experimental procedure
(Figure S5), after removing cells and other debris by centrifugation at
300 3 g, 1200 3 g, and 10,000 3 g, the supernatant was centrifuged at
110,000 3 g for 2 hr (all steps were performed at 4 C). MVs were collected
from the pellet and resuspended in FBS-free medium.
OptiPrep-based density gradient centrifugation was conducted as
previously described (Bartz et al., 2008) (see Supplemental Experimental
Procedures).
Cryo-Electron Microscopy and Transmission Electron Microscopy
Detailed methods for performing cryo-EM and TEM are described in the
Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
RNA Isolation and Quantitative RT-PCR of Mature miRNAs
Total RNA of MVs derived from 108 cells was extracted using TRIzol Reagent
(Invitrogen). Quantitative RT-PCR was carried out using TaqMan miRNA
probes (Applied Biosystems; Foster City, CA) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Briefly, 5 ml of total RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA using
AMV reverse transcriptase (TaKaRa; Dalian, China) and a stem-loop RT primer
(Applied Biosystems). Real-time PCR was performed using a TaqMan PCR kit
on an Applied Biosystems 7300 Sequence Detection System. All reactions,
including no-template controls, were run in triplicate. After the reaction, the

Molecular Cell

CT values were determined using fixed threshold settings. To calculate the
absolute expression levels of target miRNAs, a series of synthetic miRNA oligonucleotides at known concentrations were also reverse transcribed and amplified. The absolute amount of each miRNA was then calculated by referring to
the standard curve. In the experiments presented here, miRNA expression in
cells is normalized to U6 snRNA, as is done in many other reports. However,
because there is no current consensus on the use of housekeeping genes for
quantitative RT-PCR analysis in MVs and the expression level of U6 snRNA
is very low in MVs (data not shown), the expression levels of target miRNAs
in MVs were directly normalized to the total protein content of MVs in our study.
Fluorescence Labeling of MVs and Confocal Microscopy
THP-1 cells were labeled with DiI-C16 for 1 hr and then washed three times
with PBS. The cells were resuspended and cultured overnight in RPMI 1640
medium supplemented with 10% FBS. The supernatants were then collected
and centrifuged to harvest MVs. THP-1 MVs were resuspended in MCDB-131
medium and incubated with cultured HMEC-1 cells. After incubation for
various length of time, HMEC-1 cells were washed, fixed, and observed under
confocal microscopy (FV1000; Olympus, Tokyo). The pictures were taken
under these conditions: Objective Lens: PLAPON 60X O NA: 1.42; Scan
Mode: XY; Excitation Wavelength: 405 nm for DAPI and 543 nm for DiI-C16;
Image Size: 1024 3 1024 Pixel.
Cell Transfection with ncRNA, Anti-miR-150, or Pre-miR-150
THP-1 or HMEC-1 cells were seeded on 60 mm dishes and were transfected
the following day using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. For overexpression of miR-150, 400 pmol of
pre-miR-150 or scrambled negative control pre-miRNA (pre-ncRNA) was
used. For knockdown of miR-150, 200 pmol of anti-miR-150 or scrambled
negative control anti-miRNA (anti-ncRNA) was used. Cells were harvested
24 hr after transfection.
Endothelial Cell Migration Assay
The migration ability of HMEC-1 was tested in a Transwell Boyden Chamber
(6.5 mm, Costar). The polycarbonate membranes (8 mm pore size) on the
bottom of the upper compartment of the Transwells were coated with 0.1%
gelatin matrix. Cells were suspended in serum-free MCDB-131 culture
medium at a concentration of 4 3 105 cells/ml, treated with or without THP1 MVs for 2 hr and then added to the upper chamber (4 3 104 cells/well). Simultaneously, 0.5 ml of MCDB-131 with 10% FBS was added to the lower
compartment, and the Transwell-containing plates were incubated for 4 hr in
a 5% CO2 atmosphere saturated with H2O. At the end of the incubation, cells
that had entered the lower surface of the filter membrane were fixed with 90%
ethanol for 15 min at room temperature, washed three times with distilled
water, and stained with 0.1% crystal violet in 0.1 M borate and 2% ethanol
for 15 min at room temperature. Cells remaining on the upper surface of the
filter membrane (nonmigrant) were scraped off gently with a cotton swab.
Images of migrant cells were captured by a photomicroscope (BX51,
Olympus). Cell migration was quantified by blind counting of the migrated cells
on the lower surface of the membrane, with five fields per chamber.
Northern Blotting Analysis
Northern blot method is described in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
Plasmid Construction and Luciferase Assay
Detailed methods are described in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
Western Blotting
c-Myb protein levels were quantified by western blot analysis of whole-cell
extracts using antibodies against c-Myb. Normalization was performed by
blotting the same samples with an antibody against GAPDH.
Animals
All animal models were maintained in a C57BL/6 background on a 12 hr light/
dark cycle in a pathogen-free animal facility at Nanjing University. The Institu-

tional Review Board of Nanjing University approved all housing and surgical
procedures. At 8 weeks of age, mice received tail-vein injections of saline or
normal THP-1 MVs or DiI-C16-labeled MVs. After 6 hr, murine thoracic aorta
endothelium was isolated, washed with PBS five times to remove contaminated exosomes, and then viewed under fluorescence microscopy. For
measurement of miRNA levels, total RNA was extracted from thoracic aorta
by using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Statistical Analysis
All photoimages of western blotting and semiquantitative RT-PCR are representative of at least three independent experiments. Quantitative RT-PCR
and cell migration assays were performed in triplicate, and each experiment
was repeated several times. Data shown are presented as means ±SEM of
at least three independent experiments; differences are considered statistically significant at p < 0.05 using Student’s t test.
