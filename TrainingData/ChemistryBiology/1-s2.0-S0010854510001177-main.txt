1. Introduction
Since the discovery of the phthalocyanines, the main focus of
the chemists has been on tailoring of their properties to produce
molecular materials for previously targeted medical or technological applications [1–13]. Thus many efforts are geared towards
the synthetic strategies in order to increase the range of possible
molecules [14–17].
The intense blue-green color of phthalocyanines is due to the
electronic delocalization of their 18 ␲ electrons. This made them

to be initially utilized industrially as dyes and pigments in various
ﬁelds [18–23].
Since then, their outstanding and tailorable properties such as
liquid crystallinity [24–26], generation of singlet oxygen [27–30]
and redox properties [31,32] have enhanced their use as efﬁcient agents in several high technology applications including:
photodynamic therapy, a technique for which phthalocyanines
are currently the most promising class of compounds [33–43],
for photodynamic antimicrobial chemotherapy [44–47], as sensors
[48–51] including biosensors [52,53], for non-linear optical applications [54–59], dye sensitised photovoltaic production [60–63],
semiconductor materials [64,65], oxidation or reduction catalysts
and photocatalysts [66–68] among others. Their combination with
nanomaterials (quantum dots, nanotubes, liposomes, dendrimers)
[69–74] may efﬁciently enhance the desired properties.
The intrinsic structure of these compounds makes them, when
unsubstituted, insoluble in nearly all the solvents. However appropriate substitution pattern helps to overcome this problem. Indeed,
the ﬂexible points for a chemist aiming at synthesizing soluble
phthalocyanines are the substitution pattern (macrocyclic and/or
axial) as well as the choice of the metal (Fig. 1). The introduction
of one or two nitrogen atoms on the isoindole subunits (the corresponding tetrapyridinoporphyrazine and pyrazinoporphyrazine
derivatives being commonly designated as azaphthalocyanines
[75]) is another point allowing for the tailoring of properties.
Water-solubility is a quest for many chemists in various ﬁelds,
as several of the current applications of phthalocyanines are of
biological interest and/or require environment friendliness, necessitating water-solubility in various concentration, pH, etc. ranges.
This is the case of biological and medical applications such as
photodynamic therapy. Another very important application of
water-soluble phthalocyanines is the catalysis of reactions in aqueous media, the main one being the degradation of pollutants.
Catalysis of reactions in aqueous media is currently becoming of
major interest [76]. Thus, when designing a phthalocyanine on
demand for a speciﬁc application, or to get a precisely targeted
property, its water-solubility may be a requirement.
A ﬁrst historical approach for using phthalocyanine in aqueous media was to formulate insoluble phthalocyanines mainly
with the preparation of emulsion [77] or incorporation in watersoluble polymers, covalently [78], by weaker interactions [79] or
by dialysis procedure [70,80]. Conferring intrinsic water-solubility
to phthalocyanines is based on two main strategies: ionic substituents or strongly hydrophilic ones, commonly carbohydrates
or polyethylene glycol. Water-soluble phthalocyanines are not systematically used in aqueous solutions. Some phthalocyanines that
are not water-soluble may become so after bonding to some polymers [81,82]. In order to limit the scope of this review, and as the

water-solubility is not an intrinsic property of the phthalocyanines,
they will not be mentioned here.
In this review, we will overview the synthesis of the reported
water-soluble phthalocyanines: anionic, cationic or non-charged.
It is important at this point to deﬁne the water-solubility we
are speaking about. Many of the applications said to require watersoluble phthalocyanines will in fact occur in aqueous medium, for
example buffered solutions. Such media are considered to belong to
our topic. The phthalocyanine macrocycle is a hydrophobic system:
to make it water-soluble, hydrophilic moieties must be added, and
the resulting system will be more or less amphiphilic. Its watersolubility depends on its overall amphiphilic balance, and as well on
other parameters such as aggregation, the “nature” of the aqueous
medium in terms of pH [83], ionic strength, presence of a cosolvent
[84] among others.
2. Anionic water-soluble phthalocyanines
Anionic substituents commonly utilized to confer watersolubility to phthalocyanines are sulfonate, carboxylate,
phosphorus-based functions, attached directly on the macrocycle
or borne by various spacers.
Their water-solubility is strongly pH-dependent, the conjugated
acid forms of these groups being not necessarily water-soluble.
The reported phthalocyanines bear usually only one type of these
functions, with the notable exception of 1 (Fig. 2) which bears
concomitantly two of the most common functions: sulfonic and
carboxylic acids [85].
Some metallated unsubstituted phthalocyanines can axially
complex cyanide ions [86–88]. This allows the solubilization of
these unsubstituted phthalocyanines (when metalated by metals

such as Fe, Ru and Os) in aqueous KCN or NaCN solutions, as a result
of the formation of water-soluble complexes bearing axial cyanide
[89–91].
2.1. Sulfonated phthalocyanines
Most of the anionic phthalocyanines bear sulfonate or sulfonic
acid groups. Their synthesis can follow different pathways, by using
sulfonated phthalocyanine’s precursors or by introducing the sulfonate function on preformed phthalocyanine, either by sulfonation
of the macrocycle or substitution in axial position. Sulfonated naphthalocyanines have also been reported [92–94]. van Lier and his
group have extensively studied sulfonated phthalocyanines and
have developed synthetic pathways to obtain asymmetric sulfonated substitution patterns.
The synthetic pathways are unfortunately not always described,
as in the case of 2 (TX-101A), 3 (TX-105-A) and 4 (TX-106A) prepared by Nippon Shokubai Co. Ltd., (Osaka, Japan) (Fig. 3) [95].
2.1.1. Symmetrically sulfonated phthalocyanines
Two strategies are reported: achieving the synthesis from sulfonated precursors or by sulfonating the phthalocyanine itself.
2.1.1.1. From sulfonated precursors. Synthetic precursors of directly
tetrasulfonated phthalocyanines 6 are sulfonated phthalic acid and
its corresponding sulfonated phthalic anhydride. The precursor can
be the sulfonic acid or the sodium salt. The ﬁrst descriptions of
sulfonated phthalocyanines date from the 50’s, by Baumann [96]
and Fukada [97]. The method was then modiﬁed by Weber and
Busch [98] to limit the metallic impurities. The starting product is
the monosodium salt of 4-sulfo phthalic acid 5, mixed with urea,
ammonium molybdate, ammonium chloride and the appropriate
metal salt and heated in nitrobenzene at 180 ◦ C (Scheme 1). The
yield is strongly related to the introduction rate of the reagents to
nitrobenzene, indeed increased when this addition is slow, over
1 hour [99].
After removal of nitrobenzene by methanol, metallic residues
are removed by an acidic washing (1N hydrochloric acid saturated
by sodium chloride). Sulfonic acid is recovered by a 0.1N sodium
hydroxide treatment. Yield is around 80%. Sulfophthalic acid can
be used as well as a starting compound for this method [100]. This
template assisted synthesis has been used to prepare a wide range
of metallated phthalocyanines, using various metal salts: metal
sulfate, metal chloride, etc. This method was then modiﬁed to be
solvent-free [101,102]. An advantage of this method is the possibility to prepare nitrogen-labeled derivatives by using 15 N-urea
[103].
The known enhancing effect of microwaves [104] in phthalocyanines synthesis [105] was successfully applied as well on the

synthesis of sulfonated phthalocyanines. Same precursors irradiated by microwaves lead, in the presence of the suitable metal salt,
to 2H, Zn, Cu, Co, AlCl, Mg, Ga(OH) [106], Sn [107], Ni, Pd, Pt [108]
phthalocyanines in excellent yields [109,110]. The metal can be
inserted as well on free-base sulfonated phthalocyanines, this is
the case of radioactive isotope of gallium (67 Ga) [111] and copper
(64 Cu) [112].
The amphiphilicity of tetrasulfonated phthalocyanines has been
modulated by exchanging the sodium counter ion with various
tetraammonium cations, leading to 7 and 8, which are soluble in
a wide range of solvents, 8 being soluble in dichloromethane and
in water (Fig. 4) [113].
Other sulfonated phthalocyanine precursors have been reported
such as substituted phthalonitriles in which the sulfonic acid function is borne by aromatic rings (9, 10 and 11, Fig. 5). They are
prepared by the condensation of 4-nitrophthalonitrile with 4hydroxybenzene sulfonic acid [114,115], monosulfonated naphthol
(1-naphthol-4-sulfonic acid) sodium salt [116] and its isomer: 5hydroxy-1-naphthalene sulfonic acid [117].

The cyclotetramerisation of 9 was initiated in pentanol,
then metalated in situ [118,119]. Phthalonitrile 10 was cyclotetramerised into the corresponding metal free phthalocyanine
in hexanol/1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU), and later
on its metalation lead to CuPc [120], ZnPc [121] or CoPc
[122] in moderate yields. Phthalonitrile 11 was directly converted into the corresponding Zn phthalocyanine (pentanol, DBU,
ZnCl2 ).
Heterocyclic aromatic sulfonamide substituted phthalonitriles
such as 15, despite a more complex synthesis, are a versatile protected form of sulfophthalonitriles [123]. They are prepared by
the chlorosulfonation of 1,2-dibromobenzene 12 and subsequent
reaction with pyrrole (and related aromatic structures such as
2-ethylpyrrole, 3,5-dimethylpyrazole, imidazole, indole), the sulfonate being protected by a heterocyclic amide function before
undergoing the Rosenmund–von Braun dinitrilation (Scheme 2:
example of the protection by pyrrole). The sulfonate function
was similarly successfully protected by a diphenylamine, but
this protection results in the inconvenience of resistance to ﬁnal
deprotection steps. After formation of the phthalocyanine, the protecting groups are removed by lithium methoxide in methanol,
methanol/THF or lithium 2-N,N -dimethylaminoethoxide in DMAE,
yielding 16.
The strongly activated 4-chlorosulfonylphthalonitrile 17 [114],
another sulfonated precursor, was used as the starting compound
for sulfonated subphthalocyanines formation. Thanks to the activating effect of the chlorosulfonyl function, 1-chlorobenzene could
be used as the solvent, the trimerization occurring at a temperature as low as 40 ◦ C, when similar reactions commonly require
the 1-chloronaphthalene’s boiling point. Sulfosubphthalocyanine
18 was obtained in high yields (around 60%) and immediately used
for the following steps. It was converted into the sulfonated pyridinium salt 19 prior to undergoing the Kobayashi’s ring expansion
[124,125]. 19 is an intermediate for the formation of asymmetric
phthalocyanines (Scheme 3).
Finally, some original octasubstituted sulfonated phthalocyanines are described. The disulfonated precursor 21, obtained
in three steps from dipotassium 2-hydroxynaphthalene-6,8disulfonate 20 (Scheme 4), is cyclotetramerised into an isomeric
mixture of octa sulfonated phthalocyanines [126].
Isomeric mixture of tetrasulfonated and tetrabrominated
phthalocyanines 23 is obtained in six-step synthesis from 4-bromo
phthalic acid 22 (Scheme 5) [127].
2.1.1.2. Sulfonation of phthalocyanines. The second widely utilized
method to prepare sulfonated phthalocyanines is the sulfonation
of the macrocycle itself.
Metal free or metallated unsubstituted phthalocyanines are
sulfonated when treated by concentrated sulfuric acid (H2 SO4 ,
35% SO3 free) at 80–100 ◦ C. A mixture of mono-, di-, tri- and
tetrasulfonated phthalocyanines (24–28) is obtained (Fig. 6), the
sulfonation degree being determinable by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The stability of the metallation is
proved by UV–vis measurements. A subsequent basic treatment
easily leads to the corresponding sodium sulfonated Al, Ce or 2H
phthalocyanines [100,128]. Only one sulfo unit is introduced on the
4-position of each isoindole sub-unit, as established by Linstead in
1950, “although it may not be the only position attacked” [129]
as observed for halogenation [130], thus contradicting previous
observations [131].
This method was then extended to other metallated phthalocyanines [132,133] (AlPcSmix, SiPcSmix, GePcSmix, SnPcSmix, and
ZnPcSmix) following referenced procedures [134].
Attempts to control the sulfonation process and ratio remain
tedious despite attempts to play on the temperature and fuming
acid’s concentrations [135]. Tetrachlorosulfonation in meta posi-

tion of a cobalt phthalocyanine in quite soft conditions is reported,
with no proof of the sulfonation positions [136]. Attempts to quaternize the macrocyclic nitrogen of bis-(2,3)pyridinoporphyrazine

resulted surprisingly in the sulfonation of the pyridine rings, yielding 30 (Scheme 6) [137–139].

the para position of each of the eight phenyl groups (Scheme 7),
leading to the water-soluble derivative 32 [142].
Aiming at obtaining species likely to coordinate alkali or
transition metal ions, the pentanuclear crown ether substituted
phthalocyanine 38 has been designed and synthetized [143]. 1,1 Oxybis(ethyleneoxy)-bis(2-toluene-p-sulfonylaminobenzene) 33
was ﬁrst condensed on 34, and the resulting dibrominated 35 was
either directly converted into 37-Cu or underwent a dinitrilation
leading to 36 before being converted into 37. Attempts to remove
tosyle protecting groups required strong acidic medium, and the
use of concentrated sulfuric acid lead to the tetrasulfonation, 38
being obtained as a mixture of isomers (Scheme 8). 38 was highly
satisfactorily soluble in water even if the presence of sulfonate
groups is not suitable to extract alkali metal by coordination.
The other way to introduce sulfonate groups on a preformed
phthalocyanine is the coupling of tetraiodinated 39 and 40 (M = Zn,
AlOH or GaOH) with vinylsulfo groups, using Heck coupling in
water. Sodium vinyl sulfonate provided the vinylsulfo moieties
in the presence of trisodium triphenylphosphine-3,3,3-trisulfonate
(TPPTS) (Scheme 9) [144], following previously tested aqueous coupling on porphyrins [145–147]. Overall yields in 41 and 42 are
around 30–40% for this tetrasubstitution.

[148], and the interesting synthesis of axially substituted (Pc)RuL2 ,
where L can be sulfonate or amino groups [149,150]. The reported
optimized method overcomes many problems routinely encountered in ruthenium phthalocyanines synthesis [151–153] and is
based on the preliminary formation of an insoluble (Ru)Pc(NH3 )2
complex (44) from an original ruthenium complexing species (43),
44 being easily converted into the soluble (Ru)Pc(PhCN)2 (45) that
can undergo further ligand exchange with tetrabutylammonium
triphenylphosphine monosulfonate (TBA(TPPS)) leading to 46 in
high yields (Scheme 10).

2.1.2. Asymmetrically sulfonated phthalocyanines
Asymmetrically substituted sulfonated phthalocyanines are
obtained either by reaction on previously formed phthalocyanines, by the selective formation of phthalocyanines using the
Kobayashi subphthalocyanine ring expansion method, or by the

cyclotetramerisation of a mixture of two precursors (of same or
different type).
Obtaining asymmetric phthalocyanines is useful in that they
can combine desired properties such as water-solubility and functionalization for targeted applications, such as when there are

three sulfonate units and one different substituent (the presence
of only one or two sulfonates [115] may not be enough to confer
water-solubility but can enhance other interesting properties from
a spectral absorption point of view). The other interest of asymmetric phthalocyanines is the modulation of the amphiphilicity of
the molecule, hence of its biological interactions and activities, one
of the main application ﬁelds of water-soluble phthalocyanines.
2.1.2.1. Reactions on phthalocyanines. The direct sulfonation of the
macrocyclic leads to phthalocyanines with different degrees of sulfonation, which were studied for their biological activities [154].
Only one case of asymmetric functionalization of a formed
phthalocyanine is reported, using modiﬁed sulfonation conditions to introduce at the same time phthalimidomethyl and
sulfonate groups on unsubstituted Zn phthalocyanine, leading to
the asymmetric phthalocyanine 47 (Fig. 7). The unsubstituted
phthalocyanine is ﬁrstly stirred in sulfuric acid, then phthalimide,
paraformaldehyde and oleum are added and reﬂuxed for several
hours. Separation of the different isomers previously puriﬁed by
several washing and precipitating steps was achieved by reverse
phase HPLC [155].
The monoamidiﬁcation of tetraclorosulfonyl aluminium
phthalocyanine 48 by stoichiometric reaction with n-alkylamines
is described (Scheme 11) [156]. The resulting 49 is highly
amphiphilic.

the naphthadiiminoisoindoline 53, the sulfonated functions being
regenerated by an acidic work-up (Scheme 12). Zn is inserted at the
last step of the synthesis.
2.1.2.3. Mixed statistical condensations. Mixed statistical condensation of two different precursors is another method used to obtain
asymmetrically substituted phthalocyanines. Following Weber and
Busch’s method, mixed cyclotetramerisation of phthalic and sulfophthalic acids can be used to obtain asymmetric phthalocyanines.
The resulting mixtures are separated and characterized as the mixtures resulting from sulfonation of the phthalocyanine itself.
Indole-protected sulfophthalonitrile 54 [123] was engaged in
a statistical cyclotetramerisation with the iodophthalonitrile 55
[157,158] or 5-iodo-2,3-dicyanonaphthalene 56 [159] in the presence of Zn salts. Thanks to the protecting group’s stability in weakly
basic media, the resulting asymmetric phthalocyanines bearing
three indolylsulfonate and one iodide (57 and 58) can undergo versatile coupling reactions with various alkynes. The indolyl group is
then easily removed by lithium methylate in reﬂuxing methanolTHF. A series of three types of amphiphilic phthalocyanines (59a–b,
60a–g and 61a–e) are obtained after respectively Buchwald’s
palladium-catalyzed amination and palladium-catalyzed Sonogashira coupling (Scheme 13).

2.1.2.2. Ring enlargement of subphthalocyanines. The symmetric
sulfosubphthalocyanine 18, prior to undergoing ring enlargement, was converted into 19 to prevent likely reaction between
the highly reactive chlorosulfonyl moieties and diiminoisoindoline. 19 was condensed with chosen iminoisoindolines in
DMSO, leading to asymmetric phthalocyanines in elevated yields
(up to 30%) under mild conditions. This is explained by the
electron-withdrawing effect of sulfonyl substituents [124,125]. A
series of amphiphilic water-soluble phthalocyanines 50a–c was
obtained, using diiminoindoline 51, diiminoazaisoindoline 52, or

2.2. Phosphorus-based substituted phthalocyanines

Scheme 14. Coupling on phthalocyanine 62 [146].

Avoiding protection steps of the sulfo function, the phthalic
acid 5 reacts with 4-iodophthalonitrile 55 (molar ratio 5:1) in
presence of ammonium chloride, ammonium molybdate, urea and
gallium chloride, leading directly to the water-soluble asymmetric phthalocyanine 62 which easily undergoes palladium-catalyzed
cross-coupling reactions: Heck, Suzuki and Sonogashira, leading to
the amphiphilic water-soluble phthalocyanines 63a–f (Scheme 14)
[146].
AB3 type asymmetric phthalocyanines bearing three sulfonate
groups and one tert-butyl have been prepared following the same
way, from 4-sulfophthalic acid and tert-butyl phthalic acid [160].

Only a few water-soluble phthalocyanines bearing phosphorusbased substituents are reported. Either phosphate, phosphonate or
phosphinate functions are described.
The synthesis of phosphonate substituted phthalocyanines is
particularly useful for comparison of their properties with those
of their homologous derivatives: sulfonated phthalocyanines. This
was the purpose of the ﬁrst phosphonated phthalocyanine 66: its
interest lay on the modulation of its pKa values compared to analogous sulfonated phthalocyanines, leading to adjustment of some
properties associated with water-solubility for further biological
applications. From a synthetic strategy point of view, the phosphate group is introduced on the bromomethylphthalonitrile 64,
obtained by the NBS alkylbromination of 4-methylphthalonitrile.
64 reacts with triethylphosphite. Subsequent elimination of ethyl
bromide by Arbuzov’s rearrangement leads to the diethyl 3,4dicyanobenzylphosphonate phthalonitrile 65 [161]. Phosphonate
substituted zinc phthalocyanine 66 was obtained by the cyclotetramerisation of 65 in presence of zinc salts, one ethyl group being
ﬁnally removed by basic hydrolysis (Scheme 15).
The phthalocyanine 69 bears four esteriﬁed phosphate groups
and was prepared in four steps from 4-iodophthalonitrile 55 [162].
Its Heck coupling with but-3-yn-1-ol led to the hydroxylated
phthalonitrile 67 later on esteriﬁed by diethylchlorophosphate
(Scheme 16).
The two previously described phosphonate-containing phthalocyanines 66 and 69 included an alkyl space between the
phosphorus-based groups and the phthalocyanine macrocycle. The
hereafter reported phthalocyanines 72 and 73 bear phosphonate
functions directly on the macrocycle.
The direct phosphorylation of 4-iodophthalonitrile 55 into
4-diethoxyphosphinyl phthalonitrile 71, its subsequent cyclotetramerisation into 72 followed by acidic deprotection lead to
73 (Scheme 17) [163]. Solvent-free cyclotetramerisation was
attempted, as well as the use of high boiling solvent, but basic
solvents were also appropriate (yields between 30 and 60%).
Removal of ethyl groups is achieved in quite harsh conditions (HCl
6N, 20 h reﬂuxing), leading to phosphonate-containing phthalocyanines proving to have a highly pH-dependent aggregation
behavior. In another team’s studies [164], 72 was obtained from
bromophthalonitrile 70 (itself synthesized in two steps from
bromophthalimide [165]) and used to produce the free-base
derivative, in addition to the Cu and Zn ones. Final hydrolysis was
achieved in basic conditions.
2.3. Carboxyles and carboxylates substituted phthalocyanines
Polycarboxylated phthalocyanines are soluble in alkaline aqueous media in which they are unprotonated. They can also be
soluble in neutral or acidic solutions but less systematically, the

water-solubility being dependent on their metallic and substitution
pattern [166]. The characterization of carboxylated phthalocyanines by mass spectroscopy was extensively studied and proved
to be complex [167]. Carboxylated phthalocyanines can be divided
into several types: the case of tetra and octa macrocyclic carboxy-

2.3.1. Carboxylic functions borne directly by the macrocycle
2.3.1.1. Tetrasubstitution. The ﬁrst syntheses of tetracarboxylic
acid substituted phthalocyanines (TCPc) 78 were described by
Achar et al. [168,169] and Shirai et al. [170] and their coworkers and are directly inspired from Weber and Bush’s methods.
The precursor metillic acid 74 [171] or trimetillic anhydride 75
[101,166,172–177] is condensed in the absence or presence of
metals salts (e.g. CuSO4 , CoCl2 , Co(Ac)2 , AlCl3 or ZnCl2 ), and in
the presence of urea, ammonium chloride and ammonium molybdate (Scheme 18). This leads to tetraamido derivatives 76 whose
further hydrolytic conversion into the desired tetracarboxy derivatives remained unsuccessful despite several attempts and different
methods. Complete hydrolysis could not be observed, the main
product being a diamido dicarboxy derivative 77 [173,178]. The
carboxylic function is nevertheless said to be obtained by harsh
alkaline or acidic hydrolysis [175,179].
Non-peripheral derivatives were prepared by the same method
from benzene-1,2,3-tricarboxylic acid [171].
2.3.1.2. Octasubstitution. Tetraphthalimide phthalocyanine 81,
obtained from pyromellitic anhydride 79 can be hydrolyzed
into the octacarboxy phthalocyanine 82 in quite harsh acidic
conditions (20% reﬂuxing sulfuric acid, over 3 days) [106,180].

Scheme 19. Synthesis of octacarboxylic acid substituted phthalocyanine 82 [171].

Fig. 8. Dodecacarboxylated phthalocyanine 83 [181].

The use of tetracyanobenzene 80 in the presence of ammonium molybdate, urea and metal salts also leads to octaamido
phthalocyanine which can be hydrolyzed into the desired octacarboxylated derivatives by alkaline alcoholic hydrolysis (Scheme 19)
[171].
79 was used to prepare the Fe(II)2 and Co(II)2 fused dimeric
phthalocyanines 83 (Fig. 8) in respectively 19 and 24% yields [181].
The use of benzene-1,2,3,5-tetracarboxylic acid 84 (urea, ammonium molybdate, metal salt followed by hydrolysis) leads to
isomeric 85 as a mixture of positional isomers (Scheme 20) [171].
To be sure of the ﬁnal molecular structure, especially of the
carboxylation degree, and to avoid the formation of oligomeric
structures, octacarboxy Zn and Cu phthalocyanines 82 have been

prepared from diesteriﬁed phthalonitrile 90 obtained in four steps
from o-xylene 86 [182]. 90 is cyclotetramerised into the octaesteriﬁed phthalocyanine 91, with a ﬁnal hydrolysis of the esters groups
to regenerate the carboxyle groups (Scheme 21) [183].

Scheme 22. Preparation of octacarboxytetrapyrazinoporphyrazines 96 [185].

Octacarboxylated Cu phthalocyanine has been described as a
ternary complex, with two axial pyridine ligands [184].
Metallated octacarboxytetrapyrazinoporphyrazines 96 are
obtained in a three-step synthesis [185]. The condensation of
diaminomaleodinitrile 92 with diethyl dioxosuccinate 93 leads to
the diesteriﬁed phthalonitrile 94. Its cyclotetramerisation assisted
by different metal salts lead to the octaethoxycarbonyl derivative
95, and the alkaline hydrolysis of the Cu and Zn compounds lead
to 96 derivatives (M: Cu and Zn) (Scheme 22).

2.3.1.3. Asymmetric substitution pattern. All the carboxylated
phthalocyanines having an asymmetric substitution pattern are of
AB3 type and have been obtained by mixed statistical condensation
of two different precursors.
In order to obtain asymmetric substitution pattern with carboxylic groups directly borne by the macrocycle and alternated
with ﬂuorine atoms, carboxylic function was introduced on the
phthalocyanine under a phthalimide form (phthalonitrile 97),
converted after a mixed cyclotetramerisation with tetraﬂuorophthalonitrile 98 into asymmetric phthalocyanines 99 and 100,

followed by a strongly acidic hydrolysis into respectively 101 and
102 (Scheme 23), that are highly amphiphilic [186].
Octa[4,5]carboxyphthalocyanine tetraanhydrides 103 [187–
189] react easily with amines. Asymmetric carboxyphthalocyanine 104 bearing one rhodamine moiety was prepared from
cobalt phthalocyanine 103 and is soluble in aqueous basic media
(Scheme 24) [190].
The water-solubilizing properties of directly macrocyclecarboxylated phthalocyanines allowed the formation of asymmetric labellisable phthalocyanines. Thus, carboxylated naphthalonitrile 105 [115], when undergoing a mixed condensation with
4-nitrophthalonitrile, leads to 106 easily converted into isothiocyanated phthalocyanine 108 in two steps: reduction of the
nitro function and functionalization by 1,1 -thiocarbonyldi-2(1H)pyridone 109 (Scheme 25) [191].

2.3.2. Carboxylic functions on spacer
Alternative ways have been developed to access carboxylated
phthalocyanines, in which the carboxylic functions are borne
by spacers. This carboxylic function is either present on the

phthalocyanine precursor or introduced later on a functionalized
phthalocyanine. Carboxylated precursors are generally phthalonitriles bearing one or two carboxylic functions possibly protected
by esteriﬁcation.
2.3.2.1. From carboxylated phthalonitriles. As the use of ammonia
required in the synthesis of phthalocyanine when the precursor is a phthalic derivative, leads to tetraamido groups which
are difﬁcult to hydrolyze [172], van Lier and coworkers prepared
the tetrapropionic acid substituted phthalocyanine 114 directly
from carboxylated phthalonitrile 113, obtained by a three-step
sequence from the iodophthalonitrile 55 and propargylic alcohol
110 (Scheme 26) [161].

4-(3,4-Dicyanophenoxy)-benzoic acid [106] 115 and 3-[4-(3,4dicyanophenoxy)phenyl] propionic acid 116 have similarly been
used for the preparation of the tetracarboxylated phthalocyanine
117 and 118 (Scheme 27) [119].
115 was used in mixed cyclotetramerisation together with
nitrophthalonitrile to produce precursor of labellisable phthalocyanines [191].
Dendrimeric structure 120, in which phthalocyanine is the core,
contains numerous carboxylic functions at the periphery of the
molecule resulting in signiﬁcant lowering of aggregation [192].
The starting phthalonitrile bears free carboxyl, but the cyclotetramerisation conditions in n-pentanol lead to the formation of
esteriﬁed phthalocyanine, the carboxyl groups being regenerated

afterward by a methanolic solution saturated by sodium hydroxide
(Scheme 28).
Mg and Zn tetrapyrazinoporphyrazines 124 substituted by four
carboxyl groups were prepared from the phthalonitrile derivative
123 (Scheme 29) [193]. While the Mg is directly introduced during
the cyclotetramerisation step of 123, the Zn derivative is obtained
from the free-base derivative, the latter resulting from the hydrolysis of the Li2 derivative.
2.3.2.2. From esteriﬁed phthalonitriles. Dimethyl 5-hydroxyisophthalate is widely used for dendrimer synthesis. 4Nitrophthalonitrile was substituted by various [Gn]-OH, G being
one unit of dimethyl 5-hydroxyisophthalate 125, and n = 0–2. The
resulting phthalonitriles underwent cyclotetramerisation and subsequent hydrolyis of the ester function, leading to the dendrimeric

Scheme 28. Preparation of tetracarboxylated ZnPc 120 [192].

water-soluble phthalocyanines 126a–c (Fig. 9) [194,195]. The
aggregation, which also exists for dendrimeric phthalocyanines
[196], is adequately inhibited in this case.
Ng [197] and Vicente and coworkers [198] published nearly
concomitantly the synthesis of hexadecacarboxylated phthalocyanine 128 from the dicarboxylated phthalonitrile 127, obtained
by the condensation of dimethyl 5-hydroxyisophthalate 125 on
4,5-dichlorophthalonitrile. The metallation occurred either directly
during the phthalocyanine formation or by further metallation of
the free-base phthalocyanine (Scheme 30).
The carboxylic function of the coumarine substituted phthalocyanine 130 [199] is in its lactonized form. During the opening

of a lactone (in 129) by sodium hydroxide [200], the hydroxyl
groups formed readily react on halogenoalkanes (Scheme 31). The
resulting carboxylic function can then be deprotonated by aqueous
sodium hydroxide solutions, giving rise to the highly water-soluble
phthalocyanines 130.
Hanack and coworkers reported in 1999 the synthesis of several carboxylated phthalocyanines [201], all being water-soluble.
Carboxylic functions were borne by various spacers, among which
highly elaborated substituents such as amino acid groups bearing
␣-carboxylic function. Phthalocyanine 134 was obtained from the
phthalonitrile 133, itself prepared in two steps from bromocatechol
131 and ethyl 2-bromopropionate (Scheme 32).
Another starting compound, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine
(DOPA, 135), after protecting the carboxy and amino groups,
was converted into the activated bistriﬂate 137, and underwent
subsequent conversion into the phthalonitrile 138 by a palladiumcatalyzed substitution. The source of cyanide is Zn(CN)2 . This
method was later on extended to difﬁcult substrates [202]. The
cyclotetramerisation followed by the regeneration of the carboxylic
acid functions lead to the amino acid substituted phthalocyanine
139, exhibiting an excellent water-solubility (Scheme 33) [201].
A serine-substituted phthalocyanine was synthesized from the
reaction of 3,4-dibromobenzoyl chloride with a protected serine,
followed by conversion to the corresponding phthalonitrile and
then cyclotetramerisation, before ﬁnal hydrolytic steps [201].
Tetracarboxylated phthalocyanine 146 was prepared from the
protected catechol 140 reacting with the bromo derivative 141 after
deprotonation by butyl lithium (Scheme 34).

Fig. 10. Asymmetrically substituted carboxyphthalocyanine 147 [201].

Asymmetric statistical cyclotetramerisation lead to AB3 type
phthalocyanines 147 (Fig. 10) bearing three protected carboxylic
acid functions. The fourth substituent can easily react with proteins,
thus antibodies [201].
Carboxy amino acid having their carboxylic function esteriﬁed
can be condensed to phthalonitrile, and the carboxy functions are
then regenerated after the cyclotetramerisation step (Scheme 35)
[203].

Another original molecule in which a CoPc bears four
closo-carborane cages (Scheme 36) is described, water-solubility
resulting from carboxylate sodium salt, the latter introduced in
a very original way using dimethyl malonate [204]. The carboneboronate substituted phthalonitrile 161, when undergoing
cyclotetramerisation, leads to a mixture of partially decarboxylated phthalocyanines. The complete decarboxylation was achieved
during the hydrolysis of the ester, leading to the water-soluble
phthalocyanine 162.
2.3.2.3. Generation of the carboxylic function on preformed phthalocyanine. Easily obtainable tetrasulfonyl chloride phthalocyanine
48, which can readily be converted to sulfonamide derivatives,
reacts with the amino acid glycine or with 6-aminohexanoic acid
and yields tetracarboxylated phthalocyanines 163a [178] and 163b
[205] with four sulfonamide functions (Scheme 37).
Selective synthesis of tricarboxylate substituted phthalocyanines can also be achieved via palladium-catalyzed coupling
reactions of asymmetrically substituted triiodo phthalocyanines
(prepared by the ring expansion of triiodosubphthalocyanines by
the Kobayashi method [206] using various diiminoisoindolines)
with terminal alkynes bearing carboxylic acids functions [207].

Axially carboxylated subphthalocyanine 165 has been prepared
by substituting the chloride of 164 by hydrobenzoic acid in basic
medium [208]. The water-solubility is increased by the carboxylic
proton exchange with amine, yielding 166 (Scheme 38).
3. Cationic water-soluble phthalocyanines
Cationic groups are obtained by the quaternization of aliphatic
or aromatic nitrogen atom. The quaternization occurs at the end of
the synthetic pathway, on the formed phthalocyanine. The nitrogen
atom which will be quaternized is present during the phthalocyanine formation in the form of an amine or pyridine derivative,
or can be part of the macrocycle itself (case of the tetrapyridinoporphyrazines). A few examples describe its introduction on a
previously formed functionalized phthalocyanine [209,210]. As far
as we could ﬁnd out, both types of cationic quaternized phthalocyanines: alkyl or aromatic, were described concomitantly for the
ﬁrst time in 1989, slightly preceded by quaternized tetrapyridinoporphyrazines.
A special chapter will be devoted to the quaternization of the

3.1. Quaternization agents

3.2. Quaternized amines

When the sole quaternization is targeted, multimethylation
is the simplest way. It is achieved by several quaternization
agents that are commonly used: methyl bromide/iodide and
dimethylsulfate. All the methylating agents are potentially dangerous and must be used with care, as they are likely to
methylate DNA. Some halogenated compounds utilized as quaternizing agents are functionalized, such as bromoethylvalerate
[211] or monochloroacetic acid [212]. When one aims at modulating the amphiphilic balance of the water-soluble quaternized
phthalocyanine, iodoalkane of various alkyl chain length or
iodopolyethylene glycol of general formula CH3 (OCH2 CH2 )n I can
be utilized.
1,3-Propanesultone 167 (Fig. 11) [213] is a special quaternizing
agent as it is used in producing zwitterionic salts.

The main synthetic point is the introduction of the amino group,
knowing that the quaternization always occurs on the phthalocyanine, and is in most of the cases the last step of the synthesis.
The amino group itself can be introduced prior to the formation of
the macrocycle, or on a preformed phthalocyanine bearing suitable
substituents.

Scheme 36. Preparation of o-carboranyl substituted CoPc 162 [204].

The ﬁrst cationic phthalocyanine 174 bearing quaternized
amines was prepared by Leznoff et al. [214]. 3-N,N Diethylaminoprop-1-yne (168) was coupled to iodophthalonitrile
55 (bistriphenylphosphine, copper iodide) [215], then the triple
bond was reduced, leading to the alkylaminophthalonitrile 170.
The metal free phthalocyanine 172 was obtained from the corresponding diiminoisoindoline 171, metallated by Zn and then
quaternized by iodomethane, leading to 174 (Scheme 39). Later on
cobalt and copper quaternized derivatives obtained by the same
method, were described [216].

This ﬁrst quaternized phthalocyanine was used for the comparison of their different properties with those of anionic
and neutral ones. Since this pioneering work, many phthalonitriles mono or disubstituted bearing amino functions have
been prepared, the amino function being quaternized after the
phthalocyanine formation. A large choice of central metals is
reported.
Functionalized tertiary amine or its hydrochloride salts,
such as 2-(dimethylamino) ethanethiol [217–219], 2-(diethylamino)ethanethiol [220], 1,3-bis(dimethylamino)-2-propanol
[221,222], 2-(dimethylamino)ethanol, 3-(diethylamino)phenol,
3-(dimethylamino)phenol, 3-aminothiophenol [223] or 8-hydroxy
julolidine
(2,3,6,7-tetrahydro-1H,5H-pyrido[3,2,1-ij]quinolin8-ol) [224] have been widely and commonly grafted by ether
or thioether functions [225,226] on various precursors such
as 3- or 4-nitrophthalonitrile, 4,5-dichlorophthalonitrile, 5,6dichloropyrazine-2,3-dicarbonitrile [227,228] or more complex

phthalonitrile derivatives [229], leading (after quaternization) to
water-soluble phthalocyanines bearing generally four or eight
quaternized amines. In the case of the coumarine substituted
phthalocyanine 175, 3-[(2-diethylamino)ethyl]-7-hydroxy-4methylcoumarin was condensed on 4-nitrophthalonitrile, and
after quaternization, hydrogen bonds were established between
the ammonium groups with the vicinal carbonyl (Fig. 12) [230].
A record has been registered with 12 quaternized amino
groups on a Pd(II) phthalocyanine, obtained from 2,4,6-tris(N,N dimethylaminomethyl)phenol grafted on 4-nitrophthalonitrile.
After cyclotetramerisation of the resulting phthalonitrile 176, full
methylation of the twelve tertiary amines leads to the phthalocyanine 177 absolutely non-aggregated in water (Scheme 40) [231].
More complex synthetic pathways have been developed, enlarging the number of available molecules. Successive bromination and
Rosenmund–von Braun dinitrilation of aromatic compounds bearing protected amines is one of these methods (Scheme 41) [232]:
1-chloro-2-methyl-2-phenylpropane 178 undergoes a nucleophilic
substitution by potassium phthalimide 179. The resulting 180 is
dibrominated into 181 by bromine used as the solvent, since the
usual conditions (bromine in dichloromethane or acetic acid, in
presence of ferric chloride) were probably too mild for the poorly

reactive 180. After dinitrilation leading to 182 and its cyclotetramerisation, the removal of the protecting phthalimide occurs
on the phthalocyanine 183 leading to 184. This is followed by the
quaternization step, leading to the quaternized water-soluble Zn(II)
phthalocyanine 185 [233,234].
A synthetic strategy involving the reduction of the eight amide
functions of an octasubstituted phthalocyanine into an amine is
reported as well (Scheme 42) [235]. In this case, pyrocatechol
is the starting compound. After a disubstitution by ethylbromoacetate and bromination leading to respectively 186 and 187,
the ester function is converted by a four-step sequence into
the corresponding dimethylamide 188. This derivative undergoes
the Rosenmund–von Braun dinitrilation (189) and a subsequent
tetramerisation into the octa substituted Zn(II) phthalocyanine
190. Two more steps achieved on the phthalocyanine itself lead
respectively to 191, then to the water-soluble phthalocyanine
192.
Starting with 2-(4,5-dibromo-2-methylbenzyl)-1H-isoindoline-1,3(2H)-dione 193 [236], the amphiphilic quaternized
phthalocyanine 201 was obtained in a eight-step sequence [237],
and is partially soluble in water despite the long alkyl chain used
for the quaternization (Scheme 43).

Scheme 42. Preparation of octasubstituted quaternized phthalocyanine 192 [235].

Transition metal catalyzed coupling on halogenated phthalonitriles are another strategy to introduce amino functions. An
original synthetic pathway was developed to couple alkylated
aniline moieties with halogenated phthalonitriles (Scheme 44)
[238]: 4-bromo-N,N -dimethylaniline was converted ﬁrst of all
to its Grignard derivative, then to the corresponding boronic
acid 203. This latest intermediate is then coupled to 4iodophthalonitrile (55) [239] or dibromophthalonitrile (202)
[240].
In addition, to the phthalocyanines having symmetric substitution pattern, sulfonated ABAB type phthalocyanines 208 and 209
are described as well (Fig. 13) [241]. The latter one is, as far as
we could ﬁnd out, the only case in which a reduction reaction is
achieved, resulting in a quaternized phthalocyanine.
In the following example, the amino functions are introduced on
a functionalized phthalocyanine [242]. The 2,3:9,10:16,17:23,24tetrakis (dicarboxanhydride) phthalocyanine 210, obtained from

benzene-1,2,4,5-tetracarboxylic acid dianhydride [243], reacts
with N,N -diethylethylenediamine to yield N-substituted imid substituted phthalocyanines 211. The diethylamino moiety is then
quaternized by R-X leading to highly water-soluble complexes 212
(Scheme 45), water-solubility being modulated nevertheless by the
central metal.
Ammonium functions may be provided by amine containing
biological unit moieties, such as choline or 5-aminolevulinic acid
(ALA).
Octa(cholinyl)phthalocyanine oxo-titanium TiOPcChol8 213
(Fig. 14) was prepared recently by heating octakis(chloromethyl)
TiOPc with an excess of 2-dimethylaminoethanol [244].
Two phthalocyanines conjugated to 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA)
have been recently described [245], one with a symmetric substitution pattern (216) bearing four esteriﬁed ALA units, the second
one with only one unit and three menthol (219) (Scheme 46)
whose bulkiness aims at inhibiting aggregation and increasing the

uptake of phthalocyanine 219 in tumor cells [246]. Menthol was
chosen since its efﬁciency as a formulating agent had previously
been demonstrated. The precursor phthalonitrile 214 bearing a
protected hydroxyl function leads by symmetric or asymmetric
(in the presence of the menthol-substituted phthalonitrile 217)
cyclotetramerisation to the symmetrically substituted phthalocyanine 215 or the asymmetric one 218, that are esteriﬁed by
the hydrochloride salt of ALA after deprotection of the tetrahydropyrane moieties, leading respectively to the water-soluble
phthalocyanines 216 and 219. Though the amine function of ALA is
not tetraalkylated, the water-solubility is provided by its cationic
character.
Phthalocyanines 221 tetrasubstituted by guanidinium groups
were obtained by reaction of tetraamino Zn(II)Pc 220 with various carbodiimides, under conditions known to remove the central
metal [247,248]. Zn was thus re-incorporated at the end of the synthetic pathway (Scheme 47). The isopropyl derivative proved to be
the one having the best water-solubility.
The axially substituted cationic subphthalocyanine 223 is
described: the quaternized moiety is borne by the boron
atom. 2-(Dimethylamino)ethanol replaced ﬁrstly the axial chloride of the unsubstituted subphthalocyanine 164, leading to
222, that undergoes quaternization to yield 223 (Scheme 48)
[208].

Aza crown ether is a particular class of substituent likely to be
quaternized. A few papers describe the synthesis of quaternized
azacrown ether substituted phthalocyanines, such as the monoaza
crown ether 227 and 230, and the tetraaza crown 234 ethers substituted derivatives.
First monoazacrown ether substituted phthalocyanines were
prepared from the dibrominated derivative 224, directly converted
into the copper phthalocyanine 227-Cu by strong heating in pyridine in presence of CuCN [249] and quaternized by dimethylsulfate.
The preparation of other metallated phthalocyanines 227 (M = 2H,
Ni, Pb) requires more steps [250], as 224 was ﬁrst quaternized into
225 then converted into the quaternized phthalonitrile 226. The
phthalonitrile was then cyclotetramerised in presence of adequate
metal salts (Scheme 49).
This is the only description of a Rosenmund–von Braun dinitrilation applied to quaternized dibromo derivatives. Attempts to
synthesize 227 from a more expected strategy: protection by acylation of the nitrogen on 224, dinitrilation, cyclotetramerisation into
228, desacetylation in acidic medium and subsequent quaternization proved to be unsatisfactory. The concomitant desacetylation
and quaternization of acetylated 228 by an excess of dimethylsulfate in chloroform gave better yields.
Corresponding quaternized Lu homoleptic dimer 230 is
obtained in its neutral form by the quaternization of the

bulky than the previously alkylated derivatives, they are generally
more aggregated than alkyl ammonium phthalocyanines bearing
the same number of quaternized charges [244].
3.3.1. Synthesis from pyridine substituted precursors
Tetrapyridinium substituted phthalocyanines are generally prepared following a three-step pathway. Functionalized pyridines
react with 3- or 4-phthalonitrile to obtain a mono-pyridine
substituted phthalonitrile. The most commonly used pyridine
derivatives are: 4-hydroxypyridine [253–255], 3-hydroxypyridine
[101,256–261], 2-hydroxypyridine [106], 2-mercaptopyridine
[262–265], 4-hydroxymethylpyridine [266].
After cyclotetramerisation, the pyridine’s nitrogen is quaternized, leading to tetrasubstituted phthalocyanines which are
eventually water-soluble, and more or less aggregated (Scheme 52).
Cyclotetramerisation is attempted in the presence of various metal
salts and requires sometimes the preparation of the corresponding
diiminoisoindoline [261].
Tricationic subphthalocyanine 237 bearing three pyridinium
moieties on the macrocycle is prepared by similar method,
employing BCl3 as the metal salt (Scheme 53) [267]. A similar
subphthalocyanine axially substituted by a phenoxy instead of a
chloride has also been described [268].
A pyridine phthalocyanine (238) may be quaternized into
239a–d by different alkyl iodide for further studies of the effect of
the chain length in modulating the amphiphilicity of the molecule,
and thus its potential properties (Scheme 54) [101,268,269].
Octapyridinium substituted phthalocyanines are commonly
obtained following Wöhrle’s method [270], by reacting 3hydroxypyridine on 4,5-dichlorophthalonitrile, leading to 240 and
its eventual conversion into the corresponding diiminoisoindoline 241 followed by conversion into 242 in the presence of In
[271], Zn or Si [272] salts. In the case of Si, and as the quater-

nization is always the last step of the synthesis, axial substitution
on the silicon atom by bulky substituents aiming at inhibiting aggregation is previously performed. The quaternization of
242c–e is achieved by several iodinated derivatives (methyl iodine
and 1-iodo-3,6,9-trioxadecane) (Scheme 55). This quaternization
provides as expected water-solubility for the silicon derivatives
243a–d but analogous quaternized Zn(II) phthalocyanines as well
as octamethylated indium phthalocyanine remain highly aggregated in water.
Related octacationic octakis(N-methylpyridinium) pyrazinoporphyrazines 248 and 249 are described. The starting phthalonitrile derivative 245 can be prepared by reacting diaminomaleonitrile 92 with ␣-diketones-2,2 -pyridil 244, the reaction conditions
being variable [273,274]. Cyclotetramerization is achieved without solvent and assisted only by a few drops of DBU leading to the
free-base derivative [274], or in template assisted conditions [273]
(245 dissolved in dioxane followed by addition to a propyloxymagnesium slurry, or dissolved in DMF to which CuCl2 is added).
The quaternization by methylation proved to be more efﬁcient
on a metallated derivative than on the corresponding free-base
[275,276], the latter is subsequently reacted with magnesium salt
(Scheme 56) [277]. The quaternization occurs on the pyridine nitrogen atoms but not on the macrocyclic pyrazine’s ones.
Quaternized quinoline tetra- and octasubstituted phthalocyanines 250 and 251 (Fig. 15) are currently under investigation by us
[278].
A modulation of the amphiphilicity is achieved by preparing
asymmetric phthalocyanines, by statistical condensation of monoor di-2-pyridyloxy substituted phthalonitriles 252 or 240 with
hydrophobic phthalonitrile 253, the quaternization of the resulting
phthalocyanine 254 leading to amphiphilic water-soluble phthalocyanines 255 (Scheme 57) [279]. The water-solubility increases
with the number of quaternized groups.

3.3.2. Introduction of pyridine on preformed phthalocyanines
The pyridine moiety may be introduced on preformed Pc
suitably functionalized, generally by iodo, hydroxyl or carboxyl
functions. In the case of Zn(II) and free-base phthalocyanines
containing tetrapyridinium hydrochloride fragments, a tetrahydroxylated phthalocyanine (257) was ﬁrstly prepared, undergoing
later on nucleophilic substitution on 4-bromopyridine (slight
excess of 4.5 or 5 equivalents per phthalocyanine) (Scheme 58).
In this case, the pyridine groups are introduced on a preformed
phthalocyanine, with high yields: around 80% [210].
Gül’s team prepared the tetra(2-hydroxyethylthio)phthalocyanine [209] 259 and esteriﬁed it by a strong excess of 4pyridinecarboxylic acid (isonicotinic acid) 260, leading to 261

(Scheme 59) [280]. Pyridine function were quaternized or used also
to coordinate VO(acac)2 .
The synthesis of AB3-type asymmetric phthalocyanines bearing three pyridinium functions follows a method also used
for tetracarboxylated phthalocyanines (Scheme 60) [207]: 2or 3-ethynylpyridine (A substituent) are coupled to triiodophthalocyanines (262) and subsequently quaternized into 264.
The B moiety is either an unsubstituted benzene or naphtha
group, or a tBu, modulating the solubility of the phthalocyanine.
An axially phenyl-substituted analogous triiodoboron subphthalocyanine (265) was coupled with 2- and 3-ethynylpyridine
by a Sonogashira reaction [213]. 3-Pyridinylethynyl moieties sub-

stituted phthalocyanine 266a was then quaternized into 267,
when the triple bonds of the 2-pyridinylethynyl moieties of 266b
underwent a reduction prior to their quaternization, yielding 269
(Scheme 61).

Bischloromethylated phthalocyanines (the main product
obtained in chloromethylation conditions) are easily accessible and can react with trialkylamines or pyridines, leading to
methyl ammonium or pyridinium chloride salts. In this case,

the phthalocyanine itself is the quaternizing agent [178]. This
method was used by Lukyanets as well on polychloromethylated
phthalocyanines [244,281].
Unsubstituted boron subphthalocyanine 164 bearing an axial
halogen can undergo a nucleophilic substitution by 3- and
4-hydroxypyridine. Subsequent quaternization leads to watersoluble subphthalocyanine 271 (Scheme 62) [208].
3.4. Quaternized tetrapyridinoporphyrazines
The case of the tetrapyridinoporphyrazines bearing macrocyclic
quaternized nitrogen atoms (general formula in Fig. 16) is treated
separately from the previous section, as the water-solubility providing function is not borne by a substituent but is introduced
directly on the macrocyle). These phthalocyanine analogues have
been earlier depicted by Linstead et al. [282] and the ﬁrst investigations of their properties focused on unsubstituted derivatives,
prepared from pyridine-2,3-dicarboxylic acid or dicyanopyridine
[283,284] with a large choice of central metals at the center of
tetramethylated quaternized derivatives: Pd, Pt [285], Co [286], Ge,
Si, Zn, Sn [287].
The pair of electrons of the pyridine ring is not involved in the
aromaticity of the macrocycle [75], thus its quaternization is as easy
[288] as those of a pyridine. This has been widely used to produce

Fig. 17. A tetrapyridinobenzoporphyrazine quaternized by ethylbromovalerate
[211,212].

water-soluble tetrapyridinoporphyrazines. The ﬁrst quaternization
were achieved by methylation, using bromo- or idodomethane, or
dimethylsulfate [289].
Later on, different halogen derivatives bearing functional group
have been used, such as ethyl 5-bromovalerate, leading to 272, or
monochloroacetic acid [211,212] (Fig. 17).
The water-solubility depends on the nature of the alkylating
agent, when it is a dodecyl chain (273, Fig. 18), the tetracationic
nature of the molecule is not sufﬁcient to confer water-solubility
to the molecule which forms monolayer at the air–water interface
[290]. For the same reason, photodynamic activity evaluations of
273 are achieved in reverse micelle phase [291].

Scheme 63. Water-soluble quaternized crosswise bispyridinoporphyrazines 274 and 275 [138,139].

When strongly amphiphilic molecules are targeted, asymmetric structures such as ABAB type derivatives (Scheme 63) are good
options, with either external [212] or internal [138,139] macrocyclic nitrogen. In this case as well the choice of the quaternizing
agent offers interesting ﬂexibility to tailor the properties. Even if
halogenated compounds are suitable to quaternize the pyrazinic
nitrogen atoms, the common agent dimethyl or even more so
diethylsulfate lead preferentially to the sulfonation of the pyridine groups instead of the expected quaternization [137]. These
results update Scott’s ones [292], who was the ﬁrst to describe a
quaternized pyridinoporphyrazine [283].
4. Zwitterionic phthalocyanines
Only a few molecules bearing simultaneously anionic and
cationic charges are reported. They are generally a result of the

quaternization of substituent nitrogen by propanesultone 167. This
reagent bears a hidden sulfonate function that appears after the
opening of the ring during the quaternization. This is the case of
the tetrapyridino Zn(II) phthalocyanine 276a [101], of the analogous Ge derivative 276b [261], and of the Si(OH)2 derivative 276c
[260] quaternized by propanesultone 167 (Fig. 19), all combining
four positive charges on pyridine nitrogen atoms and four sulfonate
negative functions.
Quaternization of the 3-ethynylpyridinyl substituted subphthalocyanine 266a by 1,3-propanesultone 167 provides
the zwitterionic subphthalocyanine 277 that has concomitantly pyridinium and sulfonate functions (Scheme 64)
[213].
Cobaltacarborane substituted asymmetric phthalocyanine 278
(Fig. 20), despite its zwitterionic character, is not soluble in water
[293].
5. Non-ionic water-soluble phthalocyanines
Several types of non-ionic substituents are also able to confer
water-solubility to phthalocyanines. They can be divided into three
main types: polyethyleneglycol, carbohydrate substituted phthalocyanines and other polyhydroxylated substituted derivatives.

5.1. Polyethylene glycol substituted phthalocyanines
Polyethylene glycol (PEG) substitution is a classical means to
confer water-solubility to molecular materials [294,295].
Numerous phthalocyanines bearing polyethylene glycol chains
are reported, with many variations on the chain number and/or
various ethyleneglycol units. However, from the available data,
some of these phthalocyanines are either not water-soluble (but
all said to be highly soluble in very polar solvents), or this property
was not investigated, depending on the authors’ aims [296–298].
Lyotropism, a weak water-solubility, is a common property of PEG
substituted phthalocyanines [299–305].

For the few of them reported to be water-soluble, the watersolubility is submitted to ﬁne structural variations, and various
aggregation degrees in water. Increasing the number and length of
polyoxo chains helps generally to overcome this problem [296,306],
but this is not a universal rule: phthalocyanines 279a–c bearing 12
ethylated PEG chain units (Fig. 21) are not even water-soluble [307].
In the case of asymmetric substitution pattern, the hydrophobic nature of the other substituents inhibits water-solubility [308],
but the presence of the polyoxo chain lead to interesting behaviors
[309].
The ﬁrst described derivatives contained one or two PEG chains
directly on the isoindole subunit, then branched substituents were
described, leading to phthalocyanines bearing eight or sixteen
chains depending on their tetra- or octasubstitution pattern.
5.1.1. Linear substitution pattern
The ﬁrst reported phthalocyanines 283a–c bearing polyethylene glycol chains form a series consisting of three octasubstituted
unmetallated phthalocyanines. The polyethyleneglycol chains are
methylated at the end and consist of one, seven or fourteen
ethylene glycol units (Scheme 65) [310]. Subsequently metallated
derivatives were reported [305]. These compounds are indeed
highly aggregated but nevertheless water-soluble. Their classical

synthetic pathway consists of condensing the selected starting
alcohols 280a–c on 34 into 281, proceeding to the dinitrilation
and converting the resulting phthalonitrile 282 into the expected
phthalocyanine under ammonia atmosphere.
In the subsequent studies, an alkyl moiety was introduced
between the phthalocyanine core and the PEG part [311]. The PEG
chain is connected directly to the macrocycle by an ether bond.
The synthesis of the starting phthalonitrile follows one of the two
general synthetic pathways shown on Scheme 66, starting from
pyrocatechol 284. The resulting phthalocyanines 288 prepared in
three steps following method A, from bromocathechol 131 and the
brominated derivative 285 (Scheme 67) are far more amphiphilic
but still soluble in water.
Octa- and tetrasubstituted phthalocyanines 292 [312] and 293
[300,312] bearing the PEG moiety directly linked to the macrocycle
are also reported (Scheme 68). They are prepared by substituting 289 onto 3-nitrophthalonitrile or by following the synthetic
method B described in Scheme 66 [313].
Tetrasubstituted PEG phthalocyanines 294 and 295 (Fig. 22)
illustrate the structural sensitivity towards water-solubility [299].
The presence of hydroxyl groups at the end of the chain considerably enhances the water-solubility [314,315]. The position of
the substituents has an effect as well. Phthalonitriles 296 and 297
are prepared by the condensation of 4-nitrophthalonitrile with
an excess of respectively mono- and tetraethylene glycol. Their
cyclotetramerisation is achieved in solvent-free conditions in presence of hydroquinone for the free-base derivatives 298a and 299a.
Ni, Co and Cu derivatives were prepared in quinoline in presence
of the required metal salt (Scheme 69).

chains [299].

A series of tetraethyleneglycol substituted ZnPc (300, 301,

Both water-soluble homoleptic lutetium double decker 303
bearing 16 PEG chains, and heteroleptic 305 were reported by
us [313]. 303 was prepared directly from the phthalonitrile
290 heated in presence of Lu(OAc)3 ·3H2 O in a DBU–hexanol
system (Scheme 70), whereas 305 was obtained by mixing (15C-5)4PcLu(OAc) prepared following a known procedure [316] with
292-2H (Scheme 71).

Scheme 72. Axial substitution of AlPc [318].

PEG may be introduced on the axial position of appropriately
metalated phthalocyanines: a few PEG axially substituted phthalocyanines and naphthalocyanines [317] are reported. The axial
substitution of unsubstituted chloroaluminium phthalocyanine
306 by the activated PEG derivative 307 leads to the water-soluble
phthalocyanine 308 (Scheme 72) [318].
Highly water-soluble (>5 mg mL−1 ) Si(PEG750)2 Pc (310) was
prepared in one step by the substitution of the axial chloride of
unsubstituted SiPc (309) by PEG 750 (Scheme 73) [319].

The strong hydrophilic nature of PEG is the key in providing the
satisfactory water solubility in addition to inhibiting aggregation
when located in the axial position.
5.1.2. Branched substitution pattern
The synthetic pathway previously presented Scheme 65 was
applied to the synthesis of phthalocyanine 315, from the phthalonitrile 314 (Scheme 74). 314 was prepared in three steps: 311 opens
epichlorhydrine in basic conditions, the resulting branched alcohol
achieves a nucleophilic substitution on 34 followed by the dinitrilation step leading to phthalonitrile 314. After cyclotetramerization,

2834

the resulting phthalocyanine 315 exhibits water-solubility much
better than the unbranched octasubstituted 298a [296].
Phthalocyanines 316, 317 and 318 (Fig. 24) are of closely related
structures, the main difference lying on the methylene sulfur
bridge. Following the evolution of our research interests, the watersolubility of the free-base and Ni derivatives was not investigated

at ﬁrst [320]. The water-solubility of the Zn [321] and the Ti [322]
derivatives, prepared in order to be tested as type II photosensitisers, was better for the octasubstituted derivatives than for the
tetrasubstituted ones.
The synthesis of all these phthalocyanines is based on the preparation of 1,3-di[2-2-(2-ethoxyethoxy)ethoxy)]-2-propanethiol

Fig. 24. M: 2H, Ni or Zn. Only one of the isomer of 317 (obtained as an isomeric mixture) is represented [320–322].

acterization of the mixture quite difﬁcult [324]. The synthesis of
carbohydrate octasubstituted water-soluble phthalocyanine consisting of only one isomer (or still being a diastereoisomeric mixture
because of anomeric structures) was achieved more recently.

5.2. Carbohydrate substituted phthalocyanines
Since the publication of the ﬁrst carbohydrate substituted
phthalocyanine 325 (Fig. 25) in 1989 [323], only a few examples
of carbohydrate substituted phthalocyanines have been reported
in the literature, with a signiﬁcantly increasing interest for such
compounds since 2005. Up to now, mainly Zn(II) and Si(IV) carbohydrate substituted phthalocyanines are reported, probably
because they were designed for PDT applications. Most of these
carbohydrate substituted phthalocyanines have a symmetric substitution pattern (mainly tetrasubstitution) and only a few are
asymmetrically substituted.
Carbohydrate units can be attached to the phthalocyanine either
by a glycosidic bond (with a selective anomeric conﬁguration or a
mixed one) or by one of its other functional groups. This increases
the number of possible isomers (in addition to the isomeric
mixtures of tetrasubstituted phthalocyanines), rendering the char-

Scheme 75. Preparation of branched polyethylene glycol substituted phthalonitriles 322, 323 and 324 [320–322].

Two strategies are employed to obtain water-soluble carbohydrate substituted phthalocyanines: from protected carbohydrates
phthalonitriles or directly from unprotected carbohydrate substituted phthalonitriles. In this ﬁrst case, water-solubility is obtained
only after the removing of protecting groups on the carbohydrate
units, and anyway depends on the overall substitution pattern of
the molecule. If highly hydrophobic substituents are present as well
on asymmetrically substituted phthalocyanines, the presence of
carbohydrate may not be sufﬁcient to have water-solubility, which
may actually not be the aim of making the molecules [325–328]. In
the second case, the formation of the macrocycle is the last step of
the synthetic pathway, the resulting phthalocyanine being watersoluble without requiring further steps. Several phthalocyanines
substituted by carbohydrates at the peripheral or axial position are
reported without the removal of the protecting groups, therefore
without the desired water-solubility property. This is the case of
some axially substituted Si(IV) [329,330] or Zn(II) phthalocyanines
[324,331] that have nevertheless been tested as PDT agents.
5.2.1. Symmetric substitution pattern
5.2.1.1. Tetrasubstitution by non-glycosidic bond. As stated above,
the ﬁrst phthalocyanine substituted by carbohydrate units (325)
was prepared by Maillard et al. [323], in two steps starting
from the phthalonitrile 328. After cyclotetramerisation, acidic
hydrolysis of the protecting acetal groups led to a diastereoisomeric mixture of 325. Acetalated carbohydrates, particularly
1,2:5,6-diisopropylidene-d-glucofuranose 326 and 1,2:3,4-di-Oisopropylidene-␣-d-galactopyranose 327 have been widely used
to produce carbohydrate substituted phthalocyanines. Their free
hydroxyl is easily condensed on 3-, 4-, di- or tetraﬂuorophthalonitriles, leading to starting materials 328–334 (Fig. 26). These

nucleophilic substitutions are achieved in yields similar to those
involving aliphatic alcohols.
Phthalocyanines prepared from 328, 329 and 330 were not
characterized after their acidic hydrolysis, due to the tedious
identiﬁcation of the resulting isomeric mixture. However, phthalocyanine 335 obtained by the cyclotetramerisation of 330 (Fig. 27)
was unprotected and fully characterized [332].
5.2.1.2. Tetrasubstitution by glycosidic bond. The synthesis of the
ﬁrst glycosylated phthalonitriles 337a–c (in which the carbohydrate unit, glucose, is linked to the phthalonitrile via a glycosidic
bond) was achieved in 2006. Synthetic strategy based on the
cyclotetramerization of 337a–c with further removal of the protecting groups (acetyl, benzoyl or benzyl) proved to be inadequate:
either the complete cleavage of the benzyl groups remained unsuccessful or the acyl groups degradated during the phthalocyanine
formation [333]. The method was thus modiﬁed: the protecting
groups were removed from the glucosylated phthalonitriles, the
resulting phthalonitrile 338 being directly (Scheme 76) converted
into the water-soluble tetraglucosylated phthalocyanine 339 under
smoother conditions: reaction at 100 ◦ C with zinc acetate in a 2:1
dimethylacetamide/n-butanol mixture.
This new method of aryl glycosylation, created by Hanack
and Ziegler for the preparation of protected 3,4-dicyanophenyl dglycopyranosides, exploites a common reaction of phthalonitrile
chemistry: the nitrite displacement on 4-nitrophthalonitrile by an
alcolate. It was then rapidly extended onto various acylated carbohydrates including thioaldoses [334,335], and was applied by us
to obtain the tetragalactose Zn(II) derivative [336]. As this method
does not allow an anomeric control, mixture of anomeres ␣/␤ are
obtained, in an average 1:10 proportion.

Nitro- or ﬂuoronaphthalodinitrile could not be successfully utilized for similar reactions, and naphthalonitrile 349 was obtained
by a three-step synthesis (Scheme 77) [337].
The corresponding unprotected glycosylated naphthalocyanine
350 (Fig. 28) is less soluble in water than the analogous phthalocyanine 339, due to the increased hydrophobic character of the
molecule.
Phthalonitriles bearing a glycosylated carbohydrate on a spacer
are reported [335]. In this case, ethyleneglycol in high excess
is monoglycosylated by the ␣-bromoglycosylation donors 343
(glucose or galactose), the remaining hydroxyl of 351 is tosylated leading to 352-Glc [338] and 352-Gal, then substituted by
dicyanophenol 355 (prepared in two steps by the reaction of benzylic alcohol 353 on 4-nitrophthalonitrile followed the reductive
removal of the benzyl moiety of 354), leading to the acetylated
glycosylated phthalonitriles 356. The crude desacetylated glycosides 357 are then engaged in the cyclotetramerisation reaction in
presence of Zn salts and leading directly to the tetraglycosylated
phthalocyanines 358 (Scheme 78).

Carbohydrates may be grafted as well on preformed phthalocyanines: this is the case of phthalocyanine-linked C-ribofuranosyl 360
[339], obtained in two steps via a Sonogashira coupling between
the C-allyl ribofuranose 359 and the tetraiodophthalocyanine 39
[340], followed by the removal of the toluoyl protecting groups
(Scheme 79).

published by respectively Hanack and Torres [332,341]. Disubstituted phthalonitriles 332 and 333 were prepared by
reacting 327 with 4-bromo-5-nitrophthalonitrile (with low
yields, the monosubstituted product being the major one),
4,5-diﬂuorophthalonitrile 361 [202] (nearly quantitatively) or 4,5bis(bromomethyl)phthalonitrile 364 (27%) [342].

phthalocyanines (363 and 365, Scheme 80) concomitantly

5.2.2. Asymmetric substitution pattern

amphiphilic balance. Depending on the nature of the substituents
facing the carbohydrate moieties, the resulting phthalocyanines
may not be water-soluble.
Phthalonitrile 334 was engaged in a mixed statistical cyclotetramerisation with phthalonitrile, in presence of ZnCl2 . The
expected AB3-type phthalocyanine 366 was obtained in 30%, and
converted into the water-soluble 367 by acidic hydrolysis of the
protecting acetals (Scheme 81) [343].
Cyclodextrines (CD) are a particular association of carbohydrates and also provide water-solubility, as demonstrated for a
single ␤-cyclodextrine on an asymmetric amphiphilic phthalocyanine [344]. Here again the phthalocyanines 370a–b were
formed from the unprotected phthalonitrile 369, obtained by the
condensation of an excess of the cyclodextrine ␤CD (368) on 4nitrophthalonitrile via a C6 hydroxyl (Scheme 82).

a tetraethyleneglycol bridge to the phthalocyanine macrocycle
proved to be highly water-soluble [345].
5.3. Polyhydroxylated and related compounds
5.3.1. Polyhydroxylation
Polyhydroxylation is a common means to make a molecule
to be water-soluble. The presence of several hydroxyl groups on
a phthalocyanine increases its potential water-solubility. Even
though several phthalocyanines polyhydroxylated directly on the
macrocycle are described [346–348], no observations were made
about their water-solubility. The sole presence of hydroxyl groups
is not always sufﬁcient to ensure of water-solubility. Comparative observations between our results [336] and Kobayashi’s
ones [349,350] demonstrate the fact that for glycerol substituted
phthalocyanines, the position of the substituents is more important than the total number of hydroxyl groups. Glycerol is a
cheap and versatile synthon [351,352], available under its protected form: solketal (372). Despite the fact that its structure is
closely related to that of carbohydrates, it is not an aldose nor
a ketose, but the reduced form of one of the smallest carbohydrate unit: glyceraldehyde. Several phthalocyanines substituted
by glycerol units are reported. The synthesis of such phthalocyanines results from the acidic hydrolysis of solketal substituted
ones, prepared by the cyclotetramerization of solketal substituted phthalonitriles [353] (or diiminoisoindolines if required,
as in the case of platinum phthalocyanine derivatives [354]).
Solketal reacts with 3- or 4-nitrophthalonitrile. The resulting

phthalonitriles can be directly cyclotetramerized or are previously
converted into the activated diiminoisoindolines. Octasubstituted
phthalocyanines are obtained via the formation of a disubstituted
phthalonitrile (prepared from tosylated solketal 377) by the same
method (Scheme 83).
The water-solubility of symmetrically glycerol substituted
phthalocyanines is astonishingly increased on going from octaperipheral 384 (totally insoluble in water) [319,350], to tetraperipheral 385 [336], tetra-non-peripheral 386 and octa-non-peripheral
387 which are perfectly water-soluble (Fig. 30) [355].

Following this argument, the asymmetric Zn phthalocyanine
388 (Fig. 31) is not sufﬁciently substituted to be water-soluble
[356].
Thanks to the bulkiness of the substituents inhibiting aggregation and despite the low number of hydroxyl groups, 389, 390 and
391 (Fig. 32) are soluble in buffer [357].
5.3.2. Thiols
Thiol groups also have the ability to provide water-solubility, as
shown by a recent work: phthalocyanine is partially water-soluble

2844

F. Dumoulin et al. / Coordination Chemistry Reviews 254 (2010) 2792–2847

[358]. This phthalocyanine was prepared in ﬁve steps from methyl
3-mercaptopropionate (392). Its acetylation into 393 is followed by
the selective hydrolysis of the ester and the resulting alcohol 394 is
condensed on 4-nitrophthalonitrile. The thioester 395 underwent
a cyclotetramerisation and is subsequently unprotected leading to
the phthalocyanine 396 (Scheme 84).
5.3.3. Amines
Amino functionalized phthalocyanines (Fig. 33) are also slightly
water-soluble [231–233,359] and are likely to be more soluble in
aqueous acidic medium.
6. Conclusion and outlook
Water-solubility is a required property for agents of several
biological, medical or environmental related applications. The different ways to provide phthalocyanines with it have been reviewed
here. This article, in addition to its exhaustive state of the art in
terms of recent advances in phthalocyanine synthesis, is aimed at
reﬂecting the outstanding potential of phthalocyanines, and particularly water-soluble ones, in ﬁnding some answers to worldwide
health and environmental preoccupations.
