The copper(I) halide aggregates represent a versatile family in coordination chemistry and crystal engineering. First discovered a century ago these species have been intensively investigated in the last three
decades because of their structural and luminescent uniqueness. This account reviews their research
history and frontier (Section 1), synthetic routes (Section 2) and structural diversity (Section 3), and also

1. Introduction
Copper complexes and clusters have been fascinating chemists
for centuries, mostly because of the unique role this species plays in
both physical and biological research and application [1]. Particular
attention has been paid to the photochemical and photophysical
properties of copper(I) complexes in light of the d10 electronic
conﬁguration which diversiﬁes their luminescent behavior [2–4].
Among several systems, copper(I) halide aggregates represent a
prominent and well-investigated family which currently lies at
the forefront of both coordination chemistry and crystal engineering. Generally, the copper(I) halide aggregates, whose formula is
Cux Xy Lz (where X = Cl, Br or I; L = N, S or P based organic ligand,
if available), could exist as discrete compounds or as CuX-based
building blocks (aka. “connectors” in view of crystal engineering)
embedded in coordination polymers. In the following text, some
signiﬁcant milestones and important reviews in the research realm
of copper halides will be highlighted.
The investigation into copper(I) halide aggregates probably
dates back to a hundred years ago [1], when the technique of
X-ray diffraction crystallography was not yet invented and introduced into chemical research. However, in the 1970s, the ﬁrst
and so far most prominent member in the copper(I) halide family, Cu4 I4 py4 , still captured the attentions of chemists, when Hardt
and Pierre claimed to discover the signiﬁcant luminescent property
of the Cu4 I4 py4 cluster which they termed “luminescence thermochromism” [5]. The pioneering studies by Hardt and co-workers
also pointed out that there existed at least three different complexes with the empirical formula of CuILz (z = 1, 2 or 3), which
were regulated by reaction stoichiometry [6]. The structural conﬁguration of the Cu4 I4 py4 cluster was also suggested, but most of
the evidence was indirect spectroscopic characterization, until in
1976 the ﬁrst crystallographic evidence for the Cu4 I4 py4 tetramer
unambiguously revealed its tetrahedral cubane-like conﬁguration
[7].
Early work on copper(I) halide aggregates, especially the luminescent thermochromism phenomenon, elicited the interest of
Ford et al., who continuously embarked on a careful and extensive
research project focused on the luminescent properties of Cu4 I4 py4
and its derivatives, both experimentally [8] and theoretically [9].
Thus, this review does not intend to consider the photoluminescent properties of discrete copper(I) halide aggregates, which were
discussed in other detailed reviews by Ford et al. [2,8]. This account
mainly concerns itself with the general synthetic methods for targeting copper(I) halide aggregates and their structural diversity,
especially for those incorporated in coordination polymers as building blocks.
Coordination polymers (also known as metal–organic framework) are a class of newly developed solid-state materials with
inﬁnite extended structures constructed from “connectors” (met-

als) and “linkers” (organic ligands) [10]. In recent years, some
amendments have been proposed to complement the synthetic
principle of “connectors and linkers”, and one of the most familiar approaches is to introduce inorganic clusters or aggregates as
“connectors” in place of single metal ions. It was Champness and coworkers who did the preliminary research and realized that copper
halide aggregates could be incorporated in coordination polymers
[11]. Moreover, the bridging ligand (connecting the copper halide
aggregates) gave rise to more complicated copper(I) halide architectures than did monodentate or bidentate chelating ligands. Thus,
the crystal engineering of copper(I) halides extended from only discrete oligomers to one-dimensional (1D) or even two-dimensional
(2D) and three-dimensional (3D) architectures. However, the lecture and review by Champness and co-workers only included a few
representative examples investigated in their groups, and the structural diversity of copper(I) halides was far from unveiled, which
will be the focus of this review to establish a molecular library of
copper(I) halides.
Speaking of the structural diversity aspect, a group of Swedish
and Australian chemists once composed a review on anionic copper
halides (which they termed “halocuprate complexes”) [12]. They
considered the crystal engineering of copper halides as a “difﬁcult
system”, because the knowledge and understanding of the fundamental aspects of the crystallisation process was insufﬁcient either
to permit the control of crystallisation outcomes or to determine
the structures of the products. Their review contained a part that
summarized the structural variation of known halocuprate complexes (including CuI x Xy , CuII x Xy and mixed-valence CuI/II x Xy in
which x < y), all of which were anionic aggregates, and thus these
will be excluded from this review in order not to overlap.
The survey of the documented copper(I) halide aggregates
structures is performed mostly based on the last version of the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) and the authors’ knowledge. This
review will cite representative structures of copper(I) halides, especially those involved in coordination polymers, and discuss their
general synthetic routes (Section 2) and structural diversity (Section 3). Also, research perspectives on the growth, property and
application of copper(I) halide aggregates in coordination polymers
will be given in the concluding remarks (Section 4). The authors will
not be able to mention all published structures; in this regard they
are sorry for any crucial oversights.
2. General synthetic routes for targeting copper(I) halide
aggregates
2.1. Direct CuI X (X = Cl, Br, I) sources routes: challenges and
solutions
The use of copper(I) halide salts to engineer CuI X (X = Cl,
Br, I) aggregates is a reliable approach but would encounter

R. Peng et al. / Coordination Chemistry Reviews 254 (2010) 1–18

two inherent challenges. First, the instability of copper(I) halides
(especially for CuBr and CuCl) would make the dissolution of
the metal salts accompany the oxidation of copper(I) to copper(II) in the presence of dioxygen from the air, and might lead
to the eventual reaction products of mixed-valence copper(I/II)
halides or even copper(II) halide complexes [13a]. Second, the
poor solubility of copper(I) halide salts in most common organic
solvents (only sparingly soluble in dichloromethane [13b] and
tetrahydrofuran [13c]; moderately soluble in acetonitrile and propionitrile [13d]) makes it difﬁcult to adopt the widely used
conventional solution and layering diffusion methods for making
crystals.
In order to avoid the oxidation of the copper(I) halides
caused by dioxygen from the air, all solvents should be puriﬁed prior to being used, by freshly distillation, degassing and
drying. In addition, all procedures had better be performed
in a glovebox or standard Schlenk line, vacuum line technique as well as syringe techniques under an atmosphere of
nitrogen or argon. Alternatively, a synthetic approach tackling the difﬁculty of oxidation (copper(I) to copper(II)) was
developed in our early work: the reaction involving copper(I)
halide salts was carried out in the presence of reductive agents
such as triphenylphosphine, bis(diphenylphosphino)methane or
bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane to stabilize the +1 oxidating state
of copper. This approach also partially increased the solubility of
the reactants [13e–i].
As to the second challenge of solubility, an effective approach
is to use the corresponding saturated alkali metal halide aqueous
solution to dissolve the copper(I) halide salts instead of pure water
solution (e.g. saturated KI aqueous solution for CuI salt) [14]. This
approach was widely adopted in our group [13a,15,16] and proved
to be very effective. It worked not only because the solubility of
CuI increased dramatically in saturated KI aqueous solution due
to the principle of “like dissolves like”, but for the excess iodide
ions allowed the formation of CuI X aggregates. For example, in an
early study, Holt et al. obtained three CuI crown ether based crystal
structures – a discrete compound, namely [Cu4 I6 ][Cu8 I13 ]K7 (12crown-4)6 , containing two anionic copper(I) iodide clusters, and
two 1D coordination polymers, namely [Cu4 I6 ]K2 (15-crown-5)2
and [Cu3 I4 ]K(dibenzo-24-crown-8) – from the traditional solution
reaction of CuI and different crown ethers in the presence of aqueous KI [14a].
In more recent years, hydro(solvo)thermal methods, typically
carried out in sealed teﬂon reactors (or in sealed glass tubes or
ampoules [17,18]) in the temperature range of 100–200 ◦ C under
autogenous pressure (generally 10–30 atm), have been used for the
synthesis of novel copper(I) halide complexes [13a–b,15,16,19–22].
The exploitation of the hydrothermal techniques is facile for
preparing copper(I) halide compounds because the extreme reactive conditions bring the lower viscosity and higher rate of solvent
extraction (which would minimize the problems associated with
the different solubilities of the reactants) and, most importantly,
would facilitate the crystal growth processes. This procedure
is relatively more effective in copper(I) halide systems rather
than other ones. The handling of the samples should also be
carried out under an inert atmosphere in hydro(solvo)thermal
methods as those in traditional methods [17]. For instance, in
the preparation of two templated copper(I) chloride networks,
namely [pyridinium]3 Cu3 Cl6 and {[H3 NMe]6 Cl}[H3 NMe]2 Cu9 Cl16 ,
the reactants of CuCl, organic ligands and corresponding solvents were placed in a thick walled fused silica tube by using a
Schlenk line. Then, the mixture was frozen with liquid N2 and
sealed such that the fused silica vessel was ﬁlled to 25% volume.
The reaction mixture was heated to 100 ◦ C for a long time and
then cooled to low temperature to give a high yield of products
[23].

2.2. In situ generated CuI X (X = Cl, Br, I) sources routes: involving
in situ hydro(solvo)thermal reactions
Recently, some in situ generated CuI X sources routes have been
developed as new approaches to synthesize copper(I) halide based
complexes. In these approaches, the CuI X aggregates originated
from various sources other than the speciﬁc CuI X salts. The CuI X
is generated in situ because the formation of the CuI X and the
coordination of the organic ligands to the copper(I) ions were
simultaneous (in one-pot reactions). These routes include halide
substitution, copper oxidation and copper reduction routes, in
many cases accompanying in situ hydro(solvo)thermal reactions
[24], such as organic ligand halogenation, desulfurization, alkylation and cycloaddition.
2.2.1. Halide substitution routes
This type of reaction usually uses relatively stable and soluble cuprous salts instead of copper(I) halides to react with
alkali metal halides or ammonium halides to afford CuI X. Crystals of [Cu3 X3 (dpmt)2 ] (X = I, Br, Cl) were prepared from the
reaction of a mixture of [Cu(MeCN)4 ]PF6 , dpmt, KX (X = I, Br) or
NaCl in dry N2 atmosphere by using standard Schlenk and vacuum line techniques. In this reaction, the CuI X was generated in
situ from [Cu(MeCN)4 ]PF6 by replacing the hexaﬂuorophosphate
group with halide ions [25]. Similar substitution processes were
observed in the synthesis of Cu3 X2 (dppm)3 + (X = I, Br, Cl) [26] and
Cu8 Cl[Se2 P(OR)2 ]6 (PF6 ) (R = Et, Pr, i Pr) [27].
2.2.2. Copper oxidation routes
Employing zerovalent metals in the synthesis of corresponding coordination compounds has proven to be a general route,
which was also utilized in the copper oxidation routes for preparing copper(I) halide compounds. The spontaneous ionization of
copper powder in solution in the presence of various oxidizing
agents has received much attention. The reaction of Cu powder,
CuBr2 /CuCl2 , 1,4-(1,4,8,11-tetrathiaundecano)phthalazine (ttup)
in CH3 CN and CHCl3 under a nitrogen atmosphere afforded crystals of [CuBr(ttup)]n /[Cu1.5 Cl1.5 (ttup)]n in ideal yield [28]. In these
reactions, copper(II) salts are powerful oxidizing agents in nitrile
containing solutions.
The copper oxidation route was extended by Vassilyeva et al.
Their treatment of zerovalent copper with ammonium halides in
the presence of the crown ether and rubidium halides or cesium
halides in solution afforded various crystalline products with structures constructed from anionic halogenocuprates(I) moieties and
cationic [Rb(18-crown-6)]+ /[Cs(18-crown-6)]+ moieties [29]. It is
reasonable to suppose a mechanism whereby the oxidation of copper and complex formation was conditioned by the presence of
certain proton-donating agents and dioxygen from the air via Eq. (1)
(see below) in which copper oxidation occurred under a two-step
process of Cu0 → Cu+ → Cu2+ . The forming Cu2+ ion and remaining
Cu0 powder underwent an autocatalytic reaction via Eq. (2) (see
below) in which the reverse reaction also occurred. It is known
that copper(I) ion normally disproportionates in water. However, in
the presence of MeCN, K1 changes from 10−6 mol dm−3 in water to
about 1010 mol dm−3 in MeCN/water. Moreover, the stability of the
halogenocuprate(I) crystalline product further favors the rightward
progress of the chemical equilibrium.

absent. Lu ﬁrst prepared and described a series of mixed-valent
copper(I/II) iodide coordination polymers produced from the oxidation of CuI under hydrothermal conditions [30]. The ﬁrst complex
[Cu2 I(in)2 ]n , was obtained by reacting CuI with the ligand in
oxygen-treated water under hydrothermal conditions at 140 ◦ C.
Interestingly, when the temperature was raised to 170 ◦ C, a similar reaction yielded a new complex with the same formula, namely
[Cu2 I(in)2 ]n , but with a different structure. The oxidizer dioxygen
could also be replaced with iodine to afford another new complex,
{[Cu2 (IN)3 ]I5 − ·1.5I2 ·H2 O}n . The possible reaction mechanism was
discussed in Lu’s review [30].
2.2.3. Copper reduction routes
The reduction of cupric salts has proven to be the most promising approach for in situ generation of CuI X sources. Compared with
traditional synthetic methods, hydro(solvo)thermal techniques
have more advantages for the in situ reduction of copper(II) to
copper(I), which has been widely demonstrated in many reports
[24]. The presence of pyridine-like ligands (such as bipyridine,
terpyridine and pyridylpyrazine [31]) or amine/ammonium
analogues ligands (such as 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane,
ethylenediamine
and
N-methylethylenediammonium/Nethylethylenediammonium [32]), as proton-acceptors could
promote the reduction of the copper(II) and the subsequent formation of CuI X aggregates. In these copper reduction routes, several
cooperative in situ hydro(solvo)thermal reactions occurred:
Halogenation

Desulfurization/alkylation

Cycloaddition

For example, crystals of CuBr4 (dapyBr)3 were prepared by adding
CuBr2 to the HBr solution of 2,6-diaminopyridine. The activated carbon atom in the pyridine ring of the ligand underwent bromination
during the synthesis process in which the reduction of copper(II)
to copper(I) was also accomplished [33]. Halogenation of the substituted heteroaromatic cation (such as 3-chloroanilinium) was
frequently observed by Willett et al., providing sufﬁcient evidence
for this process [34]. Lu et al. rationalized the di-iodonation process of the pyridine-dicarboxylate ligand in which both carboxylate
groups were substituted by iodine nucleophiles. They provided a
control experiment to show that only single iodine-substitution
was observed in the absence the copper(II) salts [35].
Desulfurization/alkylation: There are several more complicated
in situ hydro(solvo)thermal reactions accompanying the copper
reduction routes. Representative work by Yao and co-workers
demonstrated a simultaneous redox, alkylation and desulfurization
reaction under solvothermal conditions affording a luminescent
copper(I) chain polymer [(Cu3 I4 )(EtS-4-C5 H4 NEt)]n , and byproducts of Cu6 Cl6 (4-S-C5 H4 NH)4 and K2 SO4 [36a]. This process was
targeted via the copper reduction route in which the (Cu3 I4 − )n
chain aggregate was in situ generated from CuCl2 and KI undergoing both copper reduction and halide substitution. Based on the
isolation of the byproducts and the existence of the iodine in the
ﬁltrate, they speculated that the desulfurization process was followed by the oxidation of S2− to S6+ /I− to I2 and the reduction
of Cu2+ to Cu+ . Moreover, during the process, the direct alkylation reagent, EtI (derived from the EtOH solvent), interacted with
the pyridine-4-thiol to give the intermediate (EtS-4-C5 H4 NEt)I.
This in situ copper reduction and ligand desulfurization reaction
was further utilized by Yao and co-workers to obtain a novel
luminescent three-dimensional (3D) diamondoid Cu10 Cl10 cluster
based coordination polymer [Cu10 Cl10 (4-S-C5 H4 NH)4 ]n , with the
byproduct of CuSO4 ·5H2 O [36b]. However, the copper(II) source
is not absolutely necessary for the N-alkylation of the organic
ligand under hydro(solvo)thermal conditions. We illustrated a
similar in situ alkylation process, in which the benzotriazole ligand also underwent alkylation regardless of the introduction
of CuI (not copper(II) salt) to afford a novel benzotriazoliumtemplated Cun In cluster based 3D coordination polymer, namely
{(Cu10 I10 )(Cu6 I6 )[(Cu(bta)2 ]− 3 ·(dmbta)+ 4 ·(I− )·x(I2 )}n (x ≈ 1.5) [37].
Cycloaddition: Another interesting accompanying reaction in
the process of copper reduction and copper(I) halide aggregate
formation is in situ cycloaddition. For example, a mixture of
CuCl2 , 4-cyanopyridine, and aqueous ammonia gave crystals of
[Cu6 Cl3 (4-pytz)3 ]n under hydro(solvo)thermal conditions. Chen et
al. suggested that the triazolate was derived from the coupling of
nitriles and ammonia, which might be assisted by the copper(II)
oxidant [38]. Other cycloaddition examples, such as (CuCl)2 (dmiz)
[39a] and [(CuCl)2 (dpiz)]n [39b], were also documented. Also noted,
the copper reduction route is not absolutely necessary for the in situ
cycloaddition. Our recent work showed that the in situ formation of
tetrazolate could be facilitated in the presence of CuI (not copper(II)
salt) as metal catalyst to fabricate a series of unusual cationic CuI
aggregates based coordination polymers, namely [Cu4 I2 (cpta)2 ]n ,
[Cu6 I2 (mtta)6 (CuCN)2 ]n and [Cu10 I4 (mtta)6 ]n [40].

3. Structural diversity of copper(I) halide aggregates

Halogenation: Because of strong basicity, the nitrogen atom
in the N-containing heteroaromatic ring of the ligand would
encounter the competing reactions of coordination and protonation, and therefore halogenation of the organic species
accompanying copper reduction is very likely to happen in the presence of halogen excess agents at high temperatures (120–180 ◦ C).

3.1. General rationales for the structural diversity of copper(I)
halide aggregates
Although halides were considered to be the simplest of common
ligands, the structural diversity of the chemically simple copper
halide coordination systems was far away from comprehensively
unveiled: a more fundamental understanding and control of the

R. Peng et al. / Coordination Chemistry Reviews 254 (2010) 1–18

crystallization process and crystal structure is the prerequisite [12].
The authors state in the following text, three crucial, but not comprehensive, factors that are responsible for the structural variation
of copper(I) halide aggregates.
Inner-core variability: This variability arises from the labile coordination numbers and geometries of both copper(I) and halide
ions. Copper(I) possesses the coordination numbers of two, three
and four, which are related to the typical coordination geometries
of linear, trigonal and tetrahedral modes, respectively. Moreover,
the redox equilibria between copper(I), mixed copper(I/II) and
copper(II) usually occur even in hydro(solvo)thermal conditions
where the reduction mechanism dominates [31e]. The coordination conﬁguration of copper(II) ranges from four-connected planar
mode to higher coordinating modes such as ﬁve-connected pyramid and six-connected octahedron, etc., which complicates the
coordination chemistry of copper. Herein, the structural diversity
of mixed copper(I/II) and copper(II) halides will be excluded from
this review. On the other hand, the strongly coordinating nature of
the halide anions, which could act as terminal or ␮2 to ␮8 bridging
groups when connected to copper(I) (according to the survey in
CSD), contributes signiﬁcantly to the inner-core variability. Upon
combining these two factors, it was no wonder that the simple
binary system of copper(I) halides shows such rich structural diversity.
Outer-shell cooperativity: Normally, copper(I) halide aggregates
would not occur exclusively in crystals. In the Cux Xy Lz (where X = Cl,
Br or I; L = N, S or P based organic ligand) system, the coordinating
organic components would inﬂuence the structures of the copper(I)
halide aggregates. This effect further complicates the structural
chemistry of copper(I) halide system by turning it into a ternary
system, and it was also very important for targeting copper(I) halide
based coordination polymers. In crystal engineering, various (even
diverse) copper(I) halide aggregates are connected via bridging
organic ligands to construct inﬁnite coordination architectures. For
expatiation, the classical discrete copper(I) halide aggregates only
included rhomboid dimer, cubane tetramer and stepped cubane
tetramer [1,2,8]. In the early investigation of copper(I) halide based
coordination polymers, a richly diverse structural chemistry, such
as extended polymeric chains (including split stair, zigzag, helical,
staircase, rack and columnar ones), was observed [11,41]. However,
the complexity of these examples is little compared to that of those
newly attached to this molecular library. For example, an early
review stated that neutral 2D copper(I) halide aggregates were not
yet documented [11]. Later, such 2D layer-like aggregates were presented by our and other groups [42,43]. It is also noteworthy that
the charge, size and shape of the organic components should be
taken into account for their cooperative inﬂuence on the structures
of the copper(I) halide aggregates. A representative example is a
colossal cationic (Cu24 I10 )14+ cluster sustained by spherical anionic
polyoxometalate-based framework [44]. The above named examples will be discussed in detail later in this section.
Kinetic tunability: The above two factors could be regarded
as thermodynamic considerations, while there exist kinetic inﬂuences (especially for the crystallization process) that could not be
neglected. It is believed that the formation of the copper halide
aggregates involves kinetically fast associative/dissociative equilibria (which leads to the various outcomes for one reaction)
and slow crystallization process (which suggests the crystallized species might not be those predominant in the solution
in regard to their various solubilities) [12]. Although the ﬁnal
structures of the copper(I) halide aggregates in crystals could
hardly be predicted, it has reached the understanding that by
careful consideration of the above two processes, the diversity
of the copper(I) halide aggregates could be controlled to some
degree. The easiest approach to tune the associative/dissociative
equilibria was reactant stoichiometry variation, which was demon-

5

strated in early work of targeting Cu2 I2 py4 and (two types of)
Cu4 I4 py4 clusters [1,2,8]. In solution, all three derivatives with
the structures of rhomboid dimer (Cu2 I2 py4 ), cubane tetramer
(Cu4 I4 py4 ) and stepped cubane tetramer (Cu4 I4 py4 ) could exist. A
ratio of Cu:I:py = 1:1:1 yielded the major crystalline products of the
cubane tetramer along with minor stepped cubane tetramer crystals. However, with the Cu:I:py ratio of 1:1:2, the most common
structure was the rhomboid dimer (Cu2 I2 py4 ). The stoichiometry
affected the solution equilibria between three aggregates, making
the dominant product seize more opportunities for crystallization. The second process, namely crystallization, could also be
tuned; the best example is the utilization of hydro(solvo)thermal
techniques. Hydro(solvo)thermal conditions that created hightemperature and high-pressure environments would facilitate the
crystallization process, and thus those aggregates with poor solubility would have the chance to be dissolved and crystallized.
This might explain why hydro(solvo)thermal reactions usually
yielded different resultants from those synthesized via traditional
methods (but the thermodynamic stability of the products under
hydro(solvo)thermal conditions should also be considered to provide a comprehensive rationale).
3.2. Molecular library of copper(I) halide aggregates: an
interpretive but not comprehensive summary
This section cites representative structures of copper(I) halide
aggregates, especially for those involved in coordination polymers.
The structures were categorized according to the dimensionality
and electrostatic charges of the copper(I) halide aggregates (not the
resulting coordination polymers). All ﬁgures were reproduced by
using the original crystallographic data (CIF ﬁles) of the complexes.
Tables 1–6 summarized the basic information and cross-reference
of the cited structures.
3.2.1. Zero-dimensional aggregates
3.2.1.1. Neutral rhomboid dimer and cubane tetramer: the most common types of building blocks. The basic synthon for all copper(I)
halides was the rhombohedra with copper and halide atoms at
alternate corners, which could be connected or fused by sharing
corners or edges to form aggregates with higher nuclearity, such as
cubanes, etc. Some common aggregates, including rhomboid (a–c),
cubane (d), stepped cubane (e) and open cubane (f), were illustrated
as follows. In all charts (not regenerated from the CIF ﬁles) showing
copper halide synthons (labelled alphabetically), the halide atoms
placed at the corners of the rhombohedra were omitted for clarity.
The attached arrows showed the possible coordinating modes of
these aggregates.

The neutral Cu2 X2 rhomboid dimer (a–c) and Cu4 X4 cubane
tetramer (d) were ususally considered as candidates of secondary
building units (SBUs) for constructing higher dimensional coordination polymers because of the existance of the vacant metal
coordination sites (shown by the arrows in the above charts).
Many crystallographically characterized compounds containing
these simple CuX-SBUs are listed in Table 1 [45–49], some of which
will be discussed in the following text.

In this category, the most documented 2D coordination polymers featured a (4,4) or (6,3) topology network. The complexes
[Cu2 I2 (bpcae)2 ·(CHCl3 )3 ]n (1) and [Cu4 I4 (bpcae)2 ]n (2) were comprised of Cu2 I2 rhomboid or Cu4 I4 cubane aggregates, respectively.
Their whole structures exhibited (4,4) topology with obvious
distinctions: 1 showed non-interpenetrated layer with elliptical

cavities that were occupied by guest molecules, while 2 formed
doubly interpenetrated layers with a parallel fashion. Both types of
CuI-SBUs (Cu2 I2 and Cu4 I4 ) acted as four-coordinated nodes in the
(4,4) network with different square (b) and tetrahedral (d) geometry, respectively, and hence the layer of 2 was more corrugated
than that of 1 [45f]. The complexes of [Cu2 X2 (4,4 -bipyridine)2 ]n

(X = Cl, Br, I) (3–5) featured a series of unusual mutual interpenetrating (6,3) sheets, in which the binuclear Cu2 I2 units played the
role of three-connected nodes (c). The linear 4,4 -bipyridine ligands connected these nodes to complete the hexagonal rings in
the (6,3) nets, which further constructed the triple interlocking 3D
framework [45d,e].
Some regular 3D coordination polymers could be constructed
from the rigid tetrahedral Cu4 I4 building units (d). The complex
[Cu4 I4 ( -Me6 12Se3)]n (6) existed as a common doubly interpenetrated 3D diamondoid architecture, which contained the
four-connected Cu4 I4 cubane tetramers [46e]. The complex of
[Cu4 I4 (bpp)2 ]n (7) showed a rare chiral triple-interpenetrated
quartz net with the vertex symbol of 64 .82 . In this quartz net,
the four-connected tetrahedral Cu4 I4 nodes were connected by the
ditopic bpp linkers to form helical subchain motifs with six-fold
screw axes along the c-axis direction, which were interwoven to
generate pseudo-hexagonal channels [13b]. More recently, semiregular nets constructed from the tetrahedral Cu4 I4 -SBUs were
also reported, including an unprecedented (3,4)-connected jphtype framework, namely [(Cu4 I4 )Cu4 (hmt)4 ]n (8), in which the
Cu4 I4 -SBUs connected alternating left- and right-handed helices. In
this network, the Cu4 I4 -SBUs served as tetrahedral four-connected
nodes while the hmt ligands acted as triangular three-connected
nodes [46f].
Some unusual structural features were observed in CuX-SBUs
based coordination polymers. For example, a 2D coordination polytube [(Cu2 I2 qpy)·2(CH3 CN)·H2 O]n (9) described by Fujita et al.,
composed of four-connected Cu2 I2 aggregates (b) and conformationally helicated qpy ligand, was shown to possess the afﬁnity
for guest inclusion. Upon templation with different aromatic
guest molecules such as nitrobenzene (nbe) and cyanobenzene
(cbe), two 3D polytubes, namely [(Cu2 I2 qpy)·2(nbe)]n (10) and
[(Cu2 I2 qpy)·2(cbe)]n (11), were obtained. The different inclusion
molecules drastically inﬂuenced the overall structures. However,
the Cu2 I2 aggregate retained the four-connected planar conﬁguration, showing the rigidity and stability of this type in constructing
coordination polymers [45 g]. This feature was also indicated by a
pair of reported topological isomers, namely [Cu4 I4 (bpds)2 ]n (12
and 13), which were triggered by the solvent-induced ligand conformational variation. The tetrahedral Cu4 I4 cubane aggregates (d)
stayed stable and were linked to give either necklace or tubular
coodination polymers [13d]. Our recent work further conﬁrmed
the ability and enriched the diversity of the Cu2 I2 rhomboid aggregate in illustrating supramolecular isomerism based on a series
of solvent-dependent Cu2 I2 based pseudo-polymorphs, namely

[Cu2 I2 (bpst)2 ·xG]n (14–16) (G = none, toluene, CHCl3 or CH2 Cl2 ),
with various structures ranging from 1D double chains, 1D ribbon
to 2D layer [49].

3.2.1.2. Neutral stepped cubane and open cubane tetramers: their
deforming structural relationship. The Cu4 X4 stepped cubane (e)
[13c,14b,34a,47] and open cubane (f) [48] tetramers were less common than, but both derived from, the normal cubane tetramer (d).
The stepped cubane (e) could be envisioned as the deformation of
the normal cubane (d) by breaking two trans-Cu–X bonds located
in the same face of the cubane tetramer and bending the free rhombohedra to fulﬁll the chair conformation. The cleavage of the two
Cu–X bonds created two more coordinating vacancies for the tetrahedral copper(I) ions in the stepped cubane tetramer, warranting
this Cu4 X4 aggregate to act as six-connected SBUs in constructing
coordination polymers. The open cubane (f) was further derived
from the stepped cubane (e) by breaking two more Cu–X bonds in
the terminal rhombohedra to release two pairs of Cu–X–Cu linkages. This conﬁguration was rarely documented [48]: the Cu4 X4
aggregate contained two terminal tetrahedral copper(I) ions with
three vacant coordinating sites, and the whole aggregate could be
viewed as an eight-connected SBU.
The above mentioned deformed Cu4 I4 cubane tetramers were
crystallograpically documented in some structures of coordination
polymers. The 1D ribbon structure, namely [Cu4 I4 (hcc)(CH3 CN)2 ]n
(17), was isolated with tetradentate fused pyridazine ligands (hcc)
bridging Cu4 I4 stepped cubane tetramers (e) constituted of three
fused Cu2 I2 rhombohedra. The tetramer was connected with four
pyridazine-N atoms from two hcc ligands and two terminal acetonitrile ligands to complete the six-connected conﬁguration [47c]. The
structure of [Cu4 Br4 ([12]aneS4 )2 ]n (18) revealed a 2D network containing the rare fragment of Cu4 Br4 open cubane tetramer (f). The
triple coordination requirements of the terminal copper atoms of
Cu4 Br4 open cubane moiety were satisﬁed by three sulfur donors
from one macrocycle, and the remaining free sites of the central
copper atoms were completed by the fourth sulfur atom of another
macrocycle, giving a whole polymeric structure with (4,4) topology
[48].

dicapping 3 - and one 2 -bridging iodide atoms [47b]. One type of
deformed Cu3 X3 aggregate, which was found in a series of discrete
compounds [Cu3 X3 (dpmt)2 ] (X = I, Br, Cl) (23–25), could be envisioned as a “three-runged ladder” structure by breaking one Cu–X
bond and repositing the two associated Cu–X bonds in the distorted
Cu3 X3 octahedron in 22 [25]. Similarly, by simply breaking the middle Cu–X bond and repositing the two associated Cu–X bonds in the
Cu3 X3 “three-runged ladder” in 23–25, another deformation of the
Cu3 X3 aggregates was generated, which exhibited a six-membered
cyclic Cu3 X3 array (with alternating copper and halogen atoms)
with a quasi-boat conformation. This type of Cu3 X3 aggregate
was presented in two reported 1D coordination polymers, namely,
{Cu3 Br3 [Co{S2 CN(CH2 )4 }3 ]·MeCN}n (26) [50] and [Cu3 Cl3 (ttup)2 ]n
(27) [28]. The diverse supporters with suitable bridging length
and spatial arrangement were presumably responsible for the very
divergent conformation of the trinuclear Cu3 X3 units.
There were further deforming structural documentations about
the stepped cubane tetramers (e, g, h). In 17, the Cu4 X4 stepped
cubane tetramer (e) displayed a parallelogram with four copper(I)
atoms. As shown in the above ﬁgure, the two copper(I) atoms with
the same conﬁguration (connected with two or three bridging
iodide atoms) were placed at the diagonal of the parallelogram
[47c]. In contrast, in the complex of [Cu4 I4 (quin)4 ] (19), a distorted form of Cu4 X4 stepped cubane tetramer (g) was observed,
which contained a similar bridging parallelogram, but with the
same-conﬁguration copper(I) atoms (connected with two or three
bridging iodide atoms) located at the same short sides (top side
with three-connected copper(I); down side with two-connected
one) of the parallelogram. [14b] Both of the above tetramers
contained 2 - and 3 -bridging iodide ligands. Another distorted
Cu4 X4 stepped cubane tetramer (h) was observed in [Cu4 Cl4 {c(P5 Ph5 )}2 ] (20). In this tetramer, the four copper(I) atoms, arranged
in a rectangular array with sound Cu· · ·Cu contacts, were all threeconnected and bounded by 2 - or 4 -bridging iodide atoms.
The dicapping crown-like c-(P5 Ph5 ) ligand was responsible for
the shape-bounding of this unusual deformed tetramer [13c]. A
related deformed tetramer (h) was observed in the complex of
[Cu4 I4 (dcpm)2 ] (21) [47b]. Herein (17, 19, 20) and in the text
below, the actual conﬁguration of the copper(I) halide aggregates
were reproduced by using the original crystallographic data (CIF
ﬁles) of the complexes. The illustrators in the inserted box of the
above ﬁgure showed the representative atoms of Cu, I, Br and Cl,
respectively, in the following ﬁgures along the text.
3.2.1.3. Unusual neutral Cun Xn (n = 3–12) aggregates: from low
to high nuclearity. Compared with the above named relatively
common neutral aggregates such as Cu2 X2 dimer and Cu4 X4
tetramers, coordination architectures constructed by discrete
high-nuclear Cun Xn clusters (n > 4) were less documented. In
this section some unusual neutral Cun Xn aggregates (n = 3–12)
were discussed in light of their nuclearity (from low to high) and
structural relationship. Listed in Table 2 [50–54] were some of the
crystallographically characterized compounds containing these
unusual Cun Xn aggregates.

Cu3 X3 : The above three illustrated Cu3 X3 aggregates were structurally related. In a discrete compound [(Cu3 I3 (dcpm)2 ] (22), there
existed a Cu3 I3 distorted octahedron, in which the three copper(I)
atoms were arranged in trigonal-planar array bounded by two

Cu4 X4 : The eight-membered ring was considered to be another
isomeric form of the Cu4 X4 cubane-series aggregates discussed
above. There were ﬁve complexes, namely [Cu4 Cl4 (2,2 -bipyridyl)2 ]
(28) [31b], {(NBun 4 )2 [M(mnt)2 Cu4 I4 ]}n (M = Ni, Pd, Pt) (29–31)
[51a], and [Cu4 I4 (tptmps)2 ] (32) [51b], that contained this type
of Cu4 X4 -ring aggregate. As shown in the ﬁgures, aggregates 28,
29–31 and 32 consisted of perfectly planar Cu4 parallelograms. The
differences lay in the positions of the iodide atoms related to the
Cu4 planes. In 28, the four 2 -Cl ions were evenly distributed with
two adjacent ones upwards while the other two downwards to the
plane. In 29–31, instead, all the four 2 -I ions were located above
the plane, featuring a crown-like shape. Interestingly, in 32, two
2 -I ions and the Cu4 parallelogram formed a six-membered planar
plane, where the other two 2 -I ions lay up and down respectively.
No obvious Cu· · ·Cu bonding exists in these complexes, because
the short Cu· · ·Cu distances were mainly determined by the spatial
arrangement and bridging length of the ligands and the electronic
properties of the bridging anions. Another form of the Cu4 X4
aggregates should be highlighted, which featured a rare stepped
zig-zag oligomer-SBU where both 2 - and 3 -bridging iodide
atoms were located. This Cu4 I4 aggregate could be regarded as
the fusion of three Cu2 I2 rhomboid dimmers. It was conﬁrmed
in the structure of a 2D (4,4)-net coordination polymer, namely
[Cu4 I4 (dppeSe)2 ]n (33) [51c].

R. Peng et al. / Coordination Chemistry Reviews 254 (2010) 1–18

Cu5 X5 : There was only one example of Cu5 X5 aggregate hitherto documented in the literature, namely,
{[Cu5 I5 (Et4 tms)2 ]·EtOH·MeCN} (34) [52]. The structure of this
aggregate might be described as a distorted pentagonal bipyramid, in which the ﬁve copper(I) ions formed the distorted
ﬁve-membered basal plane while two 4 -bridging iodide ions
occupied the apical positions. Additionally, three other 2 -bridging
iodide ions and two Et4 tms ligands were unevenly fused to the
distorted pentagonal bipyramid to support this conﬁguration.

Cu6 X6 : The structures of the Cu6 X6 aggregates varied from
cages, rings to ladder-like oligomers. A prestigious member of
the Cu6 X6 cage-like aggregates was ﬁrst found in a 2D coordination polymer in 2002, namely [Cu6 Br6 (ttt)2 ]n (35). This prism-like
Cu6 Br6 aggregate was similar to the double six-membered rings
(D6R, hexagonal prisms) found in zeolites: the two face-to-face
six-membered Cu3 I3 chair-rings were alternatingly arranged, and
were connected by six pairs of perpendicular alternating Cu–I
bonds [46c]. Later, in 2005, similar typs of Cu6 X6 cage-like
aggregates were documented in another series of 2D structures,
namely [Cu6 X6 (tetpeb)2 ]n (X = I, Br, Cl) (36–38) [53b]. Another
member of the Cu6 X6 cage-like aggregates, the unprecedented
bicapped adamantoid cage-like Cu6 I6 cluster, was reported in
2004, which was then involved in a discrete compound [Cu6 I6 (mtolyl3 P)4 (CH3 CN)2 ] (39). The Cu4 I6 “adamantane” was composed
of four six-membered Cu3 I3 chair-rings, while the other two copper(I) ions were positionally disordered, occupying four Cu3 I3
faces and acting as capping atoms [53a]. Most recently, in 2008,
our group reported a unique 3D coordination polymer, namely,
{(Cu10 I10 )(Cu6 I6 )[(Cu(bta)2 ]− 3 ·(dmbta)+ 4 ·(I− )·x(I2 )}n (x ≈ 1.5) (40),
which contained this similar type of bicapped adamantoid Cu6 I6
cluster. Compared with the previous documentation, the Cu4 I6
“adamantane” was slightly distorted. It was the ﬁrst time that such
unusual neutral high-nuclear Cun Xn aggregates, Cu6 I6 and Cu10 I10
(which will be discussed later), acted as SBUs for constructing
cluster-based coordination polymers [37].

The Cu6 X6 ring-like aggregates were very rare and have never
been observed in coordination polymers. The discrete complex
[(Cu6 Cl6 (P(OPh)3 )6 (trz)2 ] (41) revealed a 12-membered puckered
oblate spheroid Cu6 Cl6 core, which was templated by the 3 triazine ligands and bounded peripherally by the bulky terminal
triphenyl phosphite ligands [53e]. Another interesting example
of the Cu6 X6 ring-like aggregates was found in a discrete complex, namely {Cu6 Br6 [(triphos)CoP3 ]2 } (42), which exhibited a

11

unique Cu6 Br6 hexagram structure where the six copper(I) ions
deﬁned the inner hexagon while the six bromide ions occupied
the outer hexagon [53f]. The formation of these macrocycles for
the copper(I) halide aggregates was conﬁgurationally unfavored,
apparently requiring the direction of templating agents or capping
ligands to occupy the central positions of the macrocycles.

The Cu6 X6 ladder-like oligomers were not regular and might
have randomly appeared. A common Cu6 X6 step-like hexamer,
which could be considered as derived from the Cu6 X6 D6R hexagonal prism (in 35–38) by breaking two parallel Cu–X bonds of the
D6R, was observed in a discrete complex [Cu6 I6 (dimap)] (43) [53c],
and a 1D ribbon-like coordination polymer [Cu6 I6 (bimpms)2 ]n (44)
[53d]. Additionally, a non-linear Cu6 X6 ladder-like aggregate was
involved in a 1D double-stranded chain-like coordination polymer, namely, {2[Co(S2 CNBun 2 )3 ]·5CuI}n (45) [50], while the Cu6 X6
mixed ring/ladder (6-4-6-membered ring) aggregate was included
in the structure of oligomeric [Cu6 Cl6 {daa}] (46) [53g] and polymeric (1D) {Cu6 Br6 (C6 H5 CN)4 [cyclo-(CH3 AsO)4 ]}n (47) [17a].

Cu8 X8 , Cu10 X10 and Cu12 X12 : Neutral Cun Xn aggregates with
nuclear numbers higher than eight were considered to be
extremely large SBUs. The structure of a 2D undulating layered
coordination polymer, {[Cu8 I8 (tptp)2 (MeCN)2 ]·2MeCN}n (48),
contained the Cu8 I8 ladder-like oligomer substructure. This Cu8 I8
ladder was not linear—it could be viewed as the zig-zag fusion of
three Cu4 I4 stepped cubanes by sharing the terminal Cu2 I2 dimers
[54]. Another Cu8 I8 aggregate was simply constructed by linking
two reverse Cu4 I4 cubane tetramers via a pair of parallel alternating
Cu–I bonds. This Cu8 I8 cluster, along with the previous shown D6R
Cu6 I6 cluster (in 35–38), builded up a pair of 3D isomeric coordination polymers, namely [(Cu8 I8 )(Cu6 I6 )(dabco)5 ]n (49a–b) [32a]. In
a unique 3D coordination polymer recently reported by our group,
namely,
{(Cu10 I10 )(Cu6 I6 )[(Cu(bta)2 ]− 3 ·(dmbta)+ 4 ·(I− )·x(I2 )}n
(x ≈ 1.5) (40 ), two types of high-nuclear CuI-SBUs were found—the
previous mentioned bicapped adamantoid Cu6 I6 cluster and the
unprecedented “S-shaped-double-bowl” Cu10 I10 cluster. This
Cu10 I10 S-shaped double bowl could be described as the splitting of
a distorted rhombic dodecahedron by adding an inverse center in
one face of the dodecahedron [37]. The highest nuclearity for neutral Cun Xn aggregates was presented in a 3D coordination polymer,
{Cu12 I12 [Cu(CH3 CN)]3 (hcc)6 ·Cu3 I6 ·CH3 CN}n (50). These inorganic

12

crown-ether-like Cu12 I12 rings stacked face to face with each other
to form hexagonal tubes (inner diameter ca. 4.1 Å), which were
further extended via tetradentate fused pyridazine ligands (hcc)
to complete the 3D framework. Surprisingly, the conﬁgurationally
unfavored 24-membered rings were not directly bonded by any
template agent; instead, discrete anionic Cu3 I6 3− aggregates and
acetonitrile solvent molecules were involved in the tubes. The
strong rigidity and planarity of the fused pyridazine ligand might
by responsible for the uniqueness of this crown-ether-like Cu12 I12
aggregate [47c].
3.2.1.4. Anionic Cux Xy (x < y) aggregates: isolated “halocuprate complexes”. The investigation of the anionic copper(I) halide aggregates
was a historic topic termed as “halocuprate complexes” in crystal
engineering during 1980s to 1990s. As mentioned in the Introduction, the structural diversity of such anionic aggregates was
reviewed by Arnby et al. [12], and hence related aggregates and
complexes will not be discussed in detail herein. Moreover, most
of the anionic copper(I) halide aggregates existed as isolated compounds, rather than serving as SBUs in coordination polymers,
which also contradicted the main point of this review to comment
on CuX-based coordination polymers.

Still, we note that nearly all the anionic copper halide aggregates were derived from the corner/edge/face sharing modes of
three simple anionic synthons, namely, linear CuX2 − anion (i),
planar triangular CuX3 2− anion (j) and tetrahedral CuX4 3− anion
(k). The largest anionic copper(I) halide aggregate by far was the
colossal Cu36 I56 20− macrocycle which was found in the complex
[(Cu36 I56 )I4 (pyH)24 ] (51) [56e]. Table 3 [55–57] cites some of the
crystallographically characterized compounds containing anionic
copper(I) halide aggregates derived from the three simple synthons.

3.2.1.5. Cationic Cux Xy (x > y) aggregates: the most unusual types of
building blocks. Compared with the extensively investigated neutral and anionic species, the formation and structures of cationic
copper(I) halide aggregates remained unexplored. Only a few
cationic Cux Xy (x > y) clusters were reported, which were mostly
isolated by anionic organic ligands containing P, S, Se or As donors.
Examples that showed the cationic Cux Xy (x > y) aggregates serving as SBUs in coordination polymers were sporadic. Herein the
authors wished to brieﬂy discuss those involved in coordination
polymers, because the number of the examples was too limited to
demonstrate general structural features. Table 4 [58] listed some

representative cationic copper(I) halide aggregates (including isolated ones).

There were two representative examples for illustrating simple cationic CuX-SBU-based coordination polymers. In a systematic
investigation on copper(I) triazolates-related complexes shown
by Chen et al., one of the targeted complexes, namely [Cu6 Cl3 (4pytz)3 ]n (52)—a 3D coordination polymer, involved the cationic
Cu6 Cl3 3+ cluster with unusual 3 - and 4 -Cl bridging modes. The
Cu6 Cl3 3+ aggregate could be viewed as a Cl-vertex-sharing rhomboid fusion terminated by two copper(I) ions, which was stabilized
by the coordination of the deprotonated anionic pytz ligands to
yield the neutral 3D coordination polymer [38]. Another example was reported by our group recently, in which a series of
unprecedented cation copper(I) iodide aggregates, Cu4 I2 2+ , Cu6 I2 4+
and Cu10 I4 6+ were trapped in the in situ formation of anionictetrazolate-based coordination polymers, namely [Cu4 I2 (cpta)2 ]n
(53), [Cu6 I2 (mtta)6 (Cu2 CN)2 ]n (54) and [Cu10 I4 (mtta)6 ]n (55),
respectively. These series of cationic aggregates were also derived
from the simple neutral Cu2 I2 rhombohedra via sharing iodide ions
and terminating copper(I) ions, and the versatile iodide anions, with
3 -, 4 - or 6 -bridging modes, were responsible for the formation
of such unusual aggregates [40].

For more sophisticated examples of cationic copper(I) halide
aggregates, one could ﬁnd the documentation of a 8 -Cl-centered
cube-like Cu8 Cl7+ cluster, which was bounded in a series of
discrete compounds, namely, {Cu8 Cl[Se2 P(OR)2 ]6 (PF6 )} (56–58)
(R = Et, Pr, i Pr) [27]. A nanometer-scale Cu24 I10 14+ cage assembled in
an intriguing (4,12)-connected 3D coordination polymer, namely,
{[Cu24 I10 (typt)12 ][PMoV 2 MoVI 10 O40 ]3 (NH4 )}n should also be highlighted (59). A detailed description of this unprecedented aggregate
could be found in the original paper by Wang et al. The formation
of this colossal cationic motif was shape and charge dependant by
the introduction of the anionic ball-shaped Keggin anions [44].
3.2.2. One-dimensional aggregates
The examination of the higher-dimensional (other than
zero-dimensional) copper(I) halide aggregates did not attract
considerable interest and attention until 1990s when research

R. Peng et al. / Coordination Chemistry Reviews 254 (2010) 1–18

concerning coordination polymers rapidly expanded. Champness
and co-workers ﬁrstly realized that neutral 1D and 2D copper(I)
halide aggregates could also serve as SBUs in targeting coordination polymers by the introducing proper bridging ligands [11]. Since
then, the structural diversity of the 1D copper(I) halide aggregates
have been continuously unveiled, including typical motifs of single chains, double chains, looped chains, helical chains, ribbons
and columns, etc. Table 5 [59–63] summarized some representative 1D copper(I) halide aggregates, some of which will be shown
and discussed later.

Single-chain motifs: The common motifs in (CuX)n aggregates
were the zigzag chains, which could be regarded as a ring-opening
form of the rhomboid dimer. The zigzag (CuX)n chain was usually
extended by fulﬁlling the tetrahedral coordination of the copper(I)
ions via multidentate bridging ligands to construct a 2D sheet network, such as [CuCl(pyd)]n (60) [18] and [CuBr(apyd)]n (61) [59a].
Different from the zigzag (CuX)n chains where all copper(I) ions
and all halides ions were in straight-line arrangements, the socalled castellated (CuI)n chain shown in a 3D coordination polymer,
namely, {[CuI(dtpcp)]MeCN}n (62), was arranged in a way that
both the copper(I) ions and the halide ions were positioned with a
zigzag fashion [59b]. An uncommon motif found in the complexes
of {(CuX)3 [cyclo-(MeAsO)4 ]2 }n (63, 64) (X = Br, Cl) added to the
diversity of single (CuX)n chains. Compared with the regular castellated chain, there were additional Cu–X linkages which separated
the valleys which lay in one side of the castellated chain [59c].

Double-chain motifs: The staircase double (CuX)n chain involved
in the 2D [(CuI)2 (quxin)]n (65) [41] and 1D [(CuI)2 (bbol)]n (66)
[60a] could be viewed as the linear extension of the Cu4 X4 stepped
cubane, or the linkage of two single zigzag (CuX)n chains via alternating middle Cu–I rungs. The distinction was made between the
two staircase (CuX)n chains because the bulky bidentate bbol ligands in 66 produced the more corrugated conformation of the stair,
compared with the ideal ladder shown in 65. In the complex of
1D double-chain [(CuCl)2 (dpiz)]n (67), two adjacent zigzag (CuCl)n
chains wriggled in opposite directions to generate six-membered
Cu3 Cl3 chair-ring units via the linkages of cis Cu–Cl bonds [39b]. The
displaced (CuBr)n zigzag-stair in the 1D [CuBr(mcn)]n (68) complex
could be regarded as the extension of the zigzag-ladder-like Cu8 X8

13

oligomer observed in 48 [60c], while two typical castellated single (CuI)n chains shown in 62 composed the double-chain (CuI)n
castellated ladder with alternating Cu–I bonding rungs shown in
the complex of 2D [(CuI)3 (psmq)(CH3 CN)]n (69) [60b].

Looped-chain motifs: Looped-chain motifs were supposed to be
those 1D copper(I) halide aggregates with four- or six-memberedring units but without fused Cu–X rungs to implement the
“ladders”. It could be observed in the 1D complexes of [CuI2 (L)]n
(70, 71) (L = meda or eeda) where the anionic (CuI2 − )n looped chain
was constructed from a line of copper-vertex-sharing rhombohedra
[32b]. When the Cu2 X2 rhombohedra was linked via Cu–X bonds
other than the copper-vertex-sharing mode, two related neutral
(CuX)n looped chains were generated in the complexes of 1D
[(CuI)[CpMo(CO)2 ]2 ( ,Á2 -Sb2 )]n (72) [61] and 1D [(CuI)(dmasa)]n
(73) [53c]. The difference between these two (CuX)n looped chains
was obvious: the Cu2 I2 rhombohedra in the former complex was
connected with a trans conﬁguration while the latter looped chain
showed a 21 screw axis with a cis offset connecting mode. In complex 74, namely, {[Cu4 Br6 et](et)2 }n , the adjacent Cu2 I2 dimers were
connected by Cu–Br–Cu linkage with a cis conﬁguration [56a]. In
complex 75, namely [Cu3 Cl3 (bipypz)]n , the above four-membered
rhombohedral “loops” were enlarged to generate six-membered
Cu3 Cl3 chair-like “loops”, which were directly connected via Cu–Cl
bonds among adjacent loops [20].

Helical-chain motifs: There were several types of helical (CuX)n
chains reported in coordination polymers, including 21 , 41 , 61 ,
31 and meso-helices. The above ﬁgures showed both of the side
and top views of these types of helical (CuX)n chains. Complexes
[(CuBr)2 (bpp)]n (76) [21] and [(CuBr)2 (tmtttf)]n (77) [62a] both
contained similar 1D inorganic 21 helical (CuBr)n SBUs which were
further connected by organic ligands to yield the overall 2D grid
network. It was interesting that short Cu· · ·Cu distances (ca. 2.84 Å)
along the (CuBr)n chains exsited in the structure of 76, which warranted the zigzag arrangement of the copper(I) atoms in the (CuBr)n

14

R. Peng et al. / Coordination Chemistry Reviews 254 (2010) 1–18

chains, while such Cu· · ·Cu contacts were not observed in 77. Unlike
the situation in 76 and 77, the two-folded helix in complex 78,
namely [(CuBr)(dpey)]n , run along two parallel axes instead of 21
screw axis forming meso-helices [62b]. The examples for the 41
helical (CuBr)n SBUs were involved in a pair of related 3D compounds [(CuBr)2 (hcc)CH2 Cl2 ]n (79) and [(CuBr)2 (hcc)]n (80). In the
former complex (CuBr)n helices existed with opposite handedness,
while in the latter one, a homochiral alignment of the subunits was
observed [47c]. The above mentioned helical motifs were based on
neutral single-chain (CuX)n helice, but the more complicated 61 and
31 helical-chain motifs were based on anionic double-chain copper(I) halide subunits. Complex [(Cu2 I3 )(tptpy)]n (81) crystallized
in a chiral space group P61 and was built of the inﬁnite helicalchain (Cu2 I3 − )n anions and the discrete tptp cations. The anionic
(Cu2 I3 )n helical-chain coiled around the 61 axis was constructed
from the previously mentioned CuI4 tetrahedral synthon (k) of
anionic copper(I) halide aggregates via sharing faces and edges of
the tetrahedra [62c]. Complex [(Cu5 I6 )Cs(1,10DT18C6)2 ]n (82) also
crystallized in a chiral space group P31 21 and contained an inﬁnite (Cu5 I6 − )n helical motif propagated through 31 screw. The 31
helical chain could be viewed as the tricyclic arrangement of the
Cu4 I4 stepped cubane (e) tetramers linked via I–Cu–I bridges. The
neighbouring helical chains were connected by the sandwich-like
[Cs(1,10DT18C6)2 ] metalloligands to generate a 3D network [22].

Ribbon and column motifs: The (CuX)n ribbons were a higherdegree aggregation of the inorganic copper(I) halide components.
For examples, ribbons constructed from the combination of
1D zigzag chains and 1D double-stranded ladder chains were
found in complexes [(CuX)2 (pyz)]n (83, 84) (X = Cl, Br) [19],
[(CuI)3 (2,2 -bipy)]n (85) [31d], [(CuI)4 (2,2 -bipy)]n (86) [31d] and
[(CuBr)3 (dpiz)]n (87) [39b]. In 83 and 84, the 1D aggregates contained simple double-chain ladders (shown in 65 and 66) which
were further linked to two simple zigzag chains via Cu–X bonds,
forming two adjacent fused 1D ladders with six-membered Cu3 X3
chair-ring units (like those in 67) oriented perpendicularly to the
central ladders. An extension of the above (CuX)n substructures
was found in 85, where the attached 1D zigzag chains were located
only on one side of the simple ladders, and two simple ladders were
placed offset face to face and linked via two sets of Cu–I bonds, forming a range of fused D6R Cu6 I6 cores (as observed in 35–38) arrayed
along the central axis. Likewise, a larger 1D ribbon aggregate was
observed in 86, where two arrays of fused Cu6 I6 D6R-based motifs
could be observed, while the 1D ribbon in 87 could be viewed as
adding two zigzag (CuI)n chains oriented perpendicular to the 1D
motifs in 83 and 84.
There were other types of regular 1D ribbons merely built of the
simple Cu2 X2 rhombohedra. The complex of [(CuI)2 (biz)]n (88) was
reported by our group to contain the 1D zigzag quadruple-chain

and triple-ladder (CuI)n ribbon which was sustained by the sidearmed benzimidazole ligands [15]. The 2D sheet of the complex
of [(Cu4 Br6 )Cu2 (OH)2 (2,2 -bipy)2 ]n (89) contained 1D (Cu4 Br6 2− )n
ribbons that could be regarded as the corner-joint combination of
two anionic (CuX2 − )n looped-chain motifs (shown in 70 and 71)
[57b].
The only (CuX)n column motif was reported in 3D complexes of
[(CuX)3 (trz)]n (90, 91) (X = Br or I) and [(CuBr)2 (trz)]n (92). The 1D
(CuX)n columnar motif (shown in the ﬁgure both its side and top
views) could be described as a series of perpendicularly stacked
Cu3 X3 chairs, which were alternately rotated by 60◦ and linked by
Cu–X contacts [42]. A detailed comparison of the three structures
(90–92) could be found in a previous short review [11]. Some irregular 1D copper(I) halide aggregates [63] listed in Table 5 are not
discussed in the text.
3.2.3. Two- and three-dimensional aggregates
The structures of 2D and 3D copper(I) halide aggregates were
sporadic, given in Table 6 [64–69].

Two-dimensional motifs: The above four neutral 2D (CuX)n undulating layers, which were observed in complexes [(CuCl)(CO)]n (93)
[64a], [(CuCl)2 (mbd)]n (94) [64b], [(CuCl)2 (fdn)]n (95) [64c] and
[(CuI)2 (trz)]n (96) [42], were all based on fused six-membered
Cu3 X3 ring-subunits and could be topologically simpliﬁed to a (6,3)
network by denoting copper(I) atoms and iodide ions as threeconnected nodes. The two types of typical conformations of the
six-membered rings were presented in the Cu3 X3 ring-subunits,
namely, chair conformation in 93 and boat conformation in 94 and
95. In 93, the valleys of the undulating sheet were placed by the
zigzag fusing seams of the face-to-face “chairs”, while in 94 and 95
the valleys were placed by the faces of the “boats”. The 2D (CuCl)n
sheet in 94 was a distorted form of the regular 2D boat-sheet in
95 because of the steric hindrance of the supporting organic ligands, which caused a squashing effect to the undulating sheet. In
96, the Cu3 I3 rings adopted another conformation other than chair
and boat ones: the six-membered rings were two-folded, and were
fused via castellated (CuI)n chains (shown in 62), other than via
zigzag chains in 93–95. The different (CuX)n layers in 93–96 provided considerable evidence to support the contention that the
ligands severely inﬂuenced the formation of the copper(I) halide
substructures.

In a topological sense, some irregular 2D (CuX)n sheets could
also be simpliﬁed as regular network such as the (6,3) net. Our

R. Peng et al. / Coordination Chemistry Reviews 254 (2010) 1–18

group reported a chiral 3D inorganic-organic hybrid coordination
polymer, {[(Cu6 I5 )(bpsmb)3 ](BF4 )·H2 O}n (97), which contained a
2D inorganic (Cu6 I5 + )n layer composed of three interwoven 1D
(CuI)n right-handed helices in different directions. When regarding the Cu3 I junction as a three-connected node, this 2D undulating
layer could be viewed as a (6,3)-topology net. The formation of this
rare chiral 2D (Cu6 I5 + )n layer was probably due to the involvement
of the highly ﬂexible bpsmb ligand [43]. Additionally, copper(I)
atoms exhibiting a tetrahedral coordination mode could also form
2D CuX layers with hexagonal units, as found in [(Cu2 Br4 )(A46)2 ]n
(98), which contained an unusual 2D (CuBr2 − )n layer. The key feature of this layer was represented by two adjacent tetrahedral
copper(I) atoms connected via two iodide ions to form two threeconnected junctions, thus generating a deforming (6,3) net [34b].

There were three other topological types of 2D (CuX)n nets. Complex [(CuCl)3 (lip)2 ]n (99) was a 2D sandwich structure with middle
(CuCl)n layer peripherally bound by the lip ligands. The (CuCl)n
layer contained the Cu4 Cl4 chair-like stepped-cubane building unit,
which was linked to four adjacent units via –Cu–Cl– linkages. By
denoting the Cu4 Cl4 chair units as four-connected nodes, the 2D
(CuCl)n layer could be rationalized to a simple (4,4)-topology net
[65]. Complex [(CuCl)3 (ody)2 ]n (100) exhibited a 2D undulating
(CuCl)n sheet with small quadrilateral Cu2 Cl2 and dodecagonal
Cu6 Cl6 ring-units, and thus the 2D (CuCl)n sheet could be topologically regarded as a three-connected (4.82 ) net in light of the
fact that both the copper(I) and chloride ions could serve as threeconnected nodes [66]. Complex [(CuI)2 (pyz)]n (101) was a 2D wavy
coordination polymer featuring a novel (CuI)n sheet with fused 4-,
6- and 8-membered CuI-rings. Each 4-membered Cu2 I2 ring was
surrounded by two 6-membered Cu3 I3 rings and two 8-membered
Cu4 I4 rings, and each 6-membered ring was surrounded by one 4membered, two 6-membered and three 8-membered rings, while
each 8-membered ring was surrounded by two 4-membered and
six 8-membered rings. This semi-regular 2D sheet was described
as a binodal (4,6,8)(62 ,8) net in topology [67].

15

Finally, two 2D double-layer copper(I) halide motifs were introduced. In the complex of [(Cu5 I6 )·(dams+ )]n (102), a regular 2D
double-layer (Cu5 I6 − )n sheet (shown in both top and side views)
was presented. Each single layer could be viewed as a slightly
corrugated hexagonal (CuI)n chair-(6,3)-sheet (observed in 93),
while viewing from the perpendicular direction there was the
typical D6R Cu6 I6 aggregate (observed in 35–38) fused to six
surrounding D6Rs [68]. The irregular 2D sheet involved in the
complex of [(Cu3 Br4 )(ahp)]n (103) was an incomplete double-layer
motif, in which a puckered 2D hexagonal (CuBr)n layer was decorated with (CuBr2 − )n chains. These one-legged-ladder-like chains
lay alternately on the opposite sides of the 2D hexagonal sheets
[34c].

Three-dimensional motifs: Only three examples of 3D copper(I)
halide polymeric aggregates were found in the CSD. A novel 3D diamondoid complex, namely [Cu10 Cl10 (4-S-pyd)4 ]n (104), contains a
decanuclear Cu10 Cl10 clusters which exhibited a regular array that
six copper(I) ions formed an octahedron and the other four were
located at the capping sites of the four faces of the octahedron.
Each decanuclear Cu10 Cl10 unit was four-connected to other four
units via four 4 -Cl atoms, resulting in a 3D framework. By simplifying the Cu10 Cl10 unit into a tetrahedral four-connected node
and the bridging Cl ions into a linear two-connected linker, the
overall framework could be described as a diamondoid net [36b].
A previously reported compound [(CuI)2 (PhCN)]n (105) could also
be described as a diamondoid network. The tetrahedral fourconnected node in this diamondoid net was generated by four
Cu8 I8 ladder motifs (shown in the inserted ﬁgure), which were
all centrosymmetric and extended along the four directions of the
tetrahedral node. Each nest-like octanuclear Cu8 I8 aggregate was
linked via the Cu2 I2 rhombic face to four adjacent units to generate
the diamondoid topology [69]. Another double-interpenetrated 3D
diamondoid copper chloride framework was found in the complex
of {(Cu7 Cl11 )[Cu(en)2 ]2 }n (106). The tetrahedral four-connected
node was composed of an unusual Cu4 tetrameric building block
which was constructed by four basic anionic CuCl4 tetrahedral synthons (k). The ﬁgure for this 3D aggregate was unavailable because
of the disorder of the Cu4 tetrameric unit in the crystal data, but
a detailed description and illustration can be found in the original
paper [32c].
4. Concluding remarks: perspectives on the growth,
property and application of copper(I) halide aggregates in
coordination polymers
This review attempts to partially answer the questions encountered in the “difﬁcult system” [12] of copper(I) halide aggregates,
and to broaden the scope of this versatile family in coordination chemistry and crystal engineering, especially in the ﬁeld of
coordination polymers. It deals with the preliminary progress
achieved—mostly the synthetic (Section 2) and structural (Section
3) aspects of copper(I) halide aggregates. Herewith, the authors
wish to share their perspectives on the remaining challenges of the
growth, properties and applications of copper(I) halide aggregates
in coordination polymers.

16

Growth: The copper(I) halide aggregates could be readily prepared via various routes (discussed in Section 2), but the difﬁculty
of this system is to visualize and control the crystallization processes, where the aggregates transform from the solution phase
to the crystal phase undergoing constitutional or conformational
changes [12]. In crystalline state, the growth of the chemically simple copper(I) halide aggregates rely heavily on crystallographic or
symmetric constraints, resulting in certain topologically regular
architectures. For instance, Champness and co-workers showed a
series of different (CuX)n polymeric framework tuned by triazine
ligands could be traced as certain parts of the 3D hexagonal wurtzite
structure of copper(I) halides [11].
In this sense, the judicious selection of the organic ligands,
taking note of their charges, sizes and shapes, was the key
to engineer copper(I) halide architectures (as shown in Section
3.2.1.5). Organometallic components, such as P or As functionalized organometallic ligands (reviewed by Scheer recently)
[70], could also be introduced to cope with the construction
of copper(I) halide architectures, sometimes yielding spectacular
polymers trapping copper(I) halide moieties, such as the intriguing highly symmetrical “inorganic fullerene” nanocluster and its
derivatives [71].
However, a precise prediction of the resulting structures is still
unavailable. The authors speculate at least two major scientiﬁc
developments must be achieved before tackling this obstacle: (i)
the plentiful empirical results should be summarized to become
a database, as accomplished by Long et al. in what they called
a “dimensional reduction” database for binary metal–anion solid
frameworks [72]; (ii) computational methods such as density
functional theory (DFT) should be utilized for the prediction of
polymeric copper(I) halide aggregates, especially for those incorporating cuprophilic interactions [73].
Properties: Speaking of the cuprophilic interaction, an important associating property of CuX-based coordination polymers is
cluster-based luminescence and thermochromism. Luminescent
coordination polymers (also known as luminescent metal–organic
frameworks) are currently a hot topic in material science and have
been recently reviewed [74]. Since the luminescence aspects of
the copper(I) halide aggregates have been extensively investigated
both experimentally [8] and theoretically [9], they are suitable candidates for serving as building blocks to construct cluster-based
luminescent coordination polymers.
In order to rule out the complications from the luminescence
of halide to ligand charge transfer (XLCT) to the cluster centered
(CC) emission, a strategy for targeting CuX CC-emissive coordination polymers is to select organic ligands that show no ligand-based
or charge transfer emissions. An example could be found in a
recent work where a non-aromatic bis-thioether ligand was chosen to combine with Cu2 I2 or Cu4 I4 clusters, yielding a 1D loop
chain and 2D network coordination polymers. In this study, the
structural evidence for the luminescence thermochromism was
unambiguously presented [75]. Also highlighted herein was a
recently reported photoluminescence switch based on a 3D coordination polymer constructed by Cu4 I4 clusters linking calixcrowns
[76].
Applications: In material science, applications of the copper
halide components are relatively rare. A prominent example is a
range of self-assembled hybrid inorganic-organic materials containing the 2D double-layer (Cu5 I6 − )n sheets (shown as 102) which
exhibited giant second-order nonlinear optical (NLO) responses
[68].
In stark contrast, a collateral family of copper(I) halides namely,
copper(I) pseudohalides (CuCN and CuSCN), can be used in photovoltaic cells for light absorbers and hole conductors [77]. The
coordination chemistry and crystal engineering of the copper(I)
pseudohalide aggregates are closely related to those of copper(I)

halide aggregates, but have their own unique features, which are
currently under our investigation and review.
