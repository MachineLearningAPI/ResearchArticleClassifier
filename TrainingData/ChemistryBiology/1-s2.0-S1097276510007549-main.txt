The large serine/threonine protein kinase mTOR regulates cellular and organismal homeostasis by coordinating anabolic and catabolic processes with nutrient, energy, and oxygen availability and growth factor
signaling. Cells and organisms experience a wide variety of insults that perturb the homeostatic systems governed by mTOR and therefore require appropriate stress responses to allow cells to continue to function.
Stress can manifest from an excess or lack of upstream signals or as a result of genetic perturbations in
upstream effectors of the pathway. mTOR nucleates two large protein complexes that are important nodes
in the pathways that help buffer cells from stresses, and are implicated in the progression of stress-associated phenotypes and diseases, such as aging, tumorigenesis, and diabetes. This review focuses on the key
components of the mTOR complex 1 pathway and on how various stresses impinge upon them.
Introduction
mTOR belongs to the family of phosphoinositide-3-kinase
(PI3K)-related kinases (PIKKs), along with ATM, ATR, DNA-PK,
and hSMG1. All of these proteins have C-terminal protein kinase
domains with similarity to the lipid kinase PI3K, thus giving the
family its name. While all members of the family respond to
genotoxic stresses, mTOR also responds to numerous other
stresses, including those related to nutrient, energy, and oxygen
levels. In addition to its kinase domain, mTOR has numerous
heat repeats in its N-terminal half, as well as a FRAP-ATMTTRAP (FAT) domain of poorly understood function.
mTOR exists in two distinct complexes called complex
1 (mTORC1) and complex 2 (mTORC2) (Guertin and Sabatini,
2007). mTORC1 is a homodimer (Takahara et al., 2006; Wang
et al., 2006; Yip et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2006), and has four
components in addition to mTOR: regulatory-associated protein
of mTOR (raptor), mammalian lethal with Sec13 protein
8 (mLST8, also known as GbL), proline-rich AKT substrate
40 kDa (PRAS40), and DEP-domain-containing mTOR-interacting protein (Deptor). The numerous heat domains in the mTOR
N-terminal half are thought to mediate its interaction with binding
partners. Raptor has many functions, and it regulates mTORC1
assembly and recruits kinase substrates, such as 4E-BP1
(Hara et al., 2002; Kim et al., 2002). Recent work reveals that
Raptor also plays an essential role in determining the subcellular
localization of mTORC1 and in sensing amino acids (Sancak
et al., 2008). Despite being a core component of mTORC1
(Kim et al., 2003; Loewith et al., 2002), the role of mLST8 remains
unclear, because its deletion has no effect on mTORC1 activity
in vivo or in vitro (Guertin et al., 2006). PRAS40 and Deptor are
components as well as substrates of mTORC1, and in the
dephosphorylated state, they appear to repress mTORC1
activity. When activated, the mTOR component of mTORC1
phosphorylates both PRAS40 and Deptor, which weakens their
association with the remainder of mTORC1 and promotes the

kinase activity of the complex (Oshiro et al., 2007; Peterson
et al., 2009; Sancak et al., 2007; Thedieck et al., 2007; Vander
Haar et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2008).
The defining component of mTORC2 is Rictor (RPTOR-independent companion of mTOR), a protein that is mutually exclusive with raptor for binding to mTOR (Jacinto et al., 2004;
Sarbassov et al., 2004). mTORC2 shares several proteins with
mTORC1, such as mLST8 and Deptor (Jacinto et al., 2004;
Peterson et al., 2009; Sarbassov et al., 2004), and, like mTORC1,
it also appears to be a multimer (Wullschleger et al., 2005).
However, mTORC2 also contains several unique components
in addition to Rictor, including mammalian stress-activated
protein kinase interacting protein (mSIN1) and protein observed
with Rictor-1 (Protor-1, also known as PRR5). Rictor is absolutely
required for mTORC2 catalytic activity (Sarbassov et al., 2004)
and may serve to recruit substrates to mTORC2, much like
Raptor does with mTORC1. Rictor and mSIN1 help stabilize
each other and thus may provide structural integrity to mTORC2
(Frias et al., 2006; Jacinto et al., 2006). Interestingly, mSIN1
contains regions of homology to Ras-binding domains and
a pleckstrin homology (PH)-like domain, suggesting that
mSIN1 may have additional roles beyond providing structural
support for mTORC2 (Schroder et al., 2007). Protor-1 binds
Rictor, but it is not required for mTORC2 catalytic function
(Thedieck et al., 2007; Woo et al., 2007). In contrast to the situation with mTORC1, mLST8 is required for mTORC2 function
in vivo and its kinase activity in vitro (Guertin et al., 2006).
As with mTORC1, Deptor binds to the FAT domain of mTOR,
and it also inhibits mTORC2 (Peterson et al., 2009).
Compared to mTORC1, our understanding of the upstream
inputs to mTORC2 is very limited, and, other than the kinases
Akt and SGK, few substrates of mTORC2 are known (Sparks
and Guertin, 2010). The development of new small-molecule
inhibitors of mTOR and genetic loss- and gain-of-function alleles
of mTORC2 components will undoubtedly lead to an expansion

Molecular Cell

Review
in our knowledge of mTORC2 function in the next few years. This
review will focus almost solely on the role mTORC1 plays in
cellular stress responses, as little is known about the potential
roles of mTORC2.
Downstream Actions of mTORC1
In response to a wide range of upstream inputs, mTORC1 regulates growth by maintaining the appropriate balance between
anabolic processes, such as macromolecular synthesis and
nutrient storage, and catabolic processes, like autophagy and
the utilization of energy stores. Many of the functions ascribed
to mTORC1 were first revealed through the use of the smallmolecule rapamycin, an allosteric inhibitor of mTOR. Upon
entering the cell, rapamycin interacts with high affinity to the
peptidyl-proline isomerase FKBP12. The resulting drug-receptor
complex then binds to the FKBP12-rapamycin-binding (FRB)
domain of mTOR, which is located between the FAT and kinase
domains (reviewed in Sarbassov et al., 2005). Interestingly, for
unknown reasons, rapamycin-FKBP12 inhibits mTORC1 activity
only toward a subset of mTORC1 substrates (Gingras et al.,
2001; Jiang et al., 2001; Kudchodkar et al., 2004; Thoreen
et al., 2009). New approaches to inhibiting mTORC1, including
loss-of-function alleles of the mTORC1 component raptor as
well as ATP-competitive inhibitors of the mTOR kinase domain,
are beginning to sort mTORC1 functions into rapamycin-sensitive and -resistant categories (Feldman et al., 2009; Nowak
et al., 2009; Thoreen et al., 2009; Yu et al., 2009). Below, we
summarize the cellular programs controlled by mTORC1, with
an emphasis on the functions of its best-known substrates: the
AGC-family S6 kinases S6K1 and S6K2 and the 4E-BP1 and
4E-BP2 proteins.
Protein Synthesis
Protein synthesis is energetically costly, requiring copious
amounts of ATP and GTP and the production of abundant
numbers of ribosomes. mTORC1 regulates the activity of the
translational machinery as a whole and also specifically controls
the translation of a subset of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) that are
thought to promote cell growth and proliferation. The mTORC1
substrates, the S6Ks and 4E-BPs, regulate several aspects of
mRNA translation in a phosphorylation-dependent fashion. The
4E-BPs, when dephosphorylated, interfere with translation
initiation by binding and sequestering the eIF-4E mRNA capbinding protein and preventing its assembly into the eIF-4F
cap-binding complex, thus blocking cap-dependent mRNA
translation (Pause et al., 1994). Phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 on
four sites by mTORC1, two of which are rapamycin sensitive,
blocks its inhibitory ability (Beretta et al., 1996; Dowling et al.,
2010; Feldman et al., 2009; Thoreen et al., 2009). The features
of mRNAs, such as those for cyclin D3 and VEGF, that are particularly sensitive to 4E-BP function are not completely clear, but
they probably include extensive secondary structures in the
50 untranslated regions (UTRs) that require unwinding by the
eIF4F complex and/or the lack of an internal ribosome entry
site (reviewed in Hay and Sonenberg, 2004; Ma and Blenis,
2009). mTORC1 is also a critical regulator of the translation of
an abundant class of mRNAs called 50 TOP mRNAs, which
have relatively short 50 UTRs that contain stretches of pyrimidines (Hornstein et al., 2001) and tend to encode for components

of the translational machinery. Although these are the bestknown class of mRNA specifically controlled by mTORC1, the
mechanism through which mTORC1 controls their translation
is unknown. For more on the regulation of translation by nutrient
levels see Spriggs et al. (2010) in this issue.
The activation of S6Ks in response to mTORC1-mediated
phosphorylation promotes mRNA translation through several
substrates, such as S6K1 aly/REF-like target (SKAR), programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4), eukaryotic elongation factor
2 kinase (eEF-2K), eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF4B), and
ribosomal protein S6 (Ma and Blenis, 2009). While S6K1
and S6K2 have overlapping functions, deletion studies in mice
and in vitro analyses have revealed separate cellular localizations and distinct functions, which are likely to be mediated
through unique substrates (Lee-Fruman et al., 1999; Pende
et al., 2004; Shima et al., 1998). However, with the exception
of SKAR, which has been shown to be a specific S6K1 substrate
(Richardson et al., 2004), it is unclear whether the substrates
mentioned earlier are acted upon by S6K1 or S6K2 or both.
S6K-mediated phosphorylation of S6, a component of the 40S
ribosomal subunit, was first characterized in regenerating livers,
and it correlates with high rates of protein synthesis under
growth-promoting conditions (Gressner and Wool, 1974).
However, cells expressing only a nonphosphorylatable S6
have increased rather than decreased rates of protein synthesis
and cell division compared to controls (Ruvinsky et al., 2005).
Thus, despite being the first S6K substrate identified, the role
of S6 in promoting translation remains unclear.
Better understood is the role of activated S6K1 in promoting
translation through elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF-2K). This
kinase normally negatively regulates translation elongation by
phosphorylating and suppressing eukaryotic elongation factor
2 (eE-F2), and S6K1 relieves this inhibition by directly phosphorylating eEF-2K (Wang et al., 2001). The S6K1 substrate, PDCD4,
inhibits translational initiation under serum withdrawal and is lost
in aggressive carcinomas (Carayol et al., 2008; Dorrello et al.,
2006). PDCD4 inhibits eIF-4A, a RNA helicase needed to unwind
secondary structures in the 50 UTR (Yang et al., 2003). Phosphorylation by S6K1 allows degradation of PDCD4 by promoting the
binding of an ubiquitin ligase, thus relieving its repression of
eIF-4A activity (Dorrello et al., 2006). S6K also activates the
helicase activity of eIF-4A through direct phosphorylation of
eIF4B (Raught et al., 2004). eIF4B potentiates the helicase
activity of eIF-4A by binding to the eIF4F complex (which
contains the helicase eIF-4A) via eIF3 (Vornlocher et al., 1999).
Phosphorylation of eIF4B by S6K promotes its association with
eIF3 and thus promotes translation initiation of mRNAs with
secondary structure within the 50 UTR (Shahbazian et al., 2006).
S6K1 also promotes the translational efficiency of newly
spliced mRNAs. Upon splicing, mRNAs recruit unique 50 capbinding proteins and the exon-junction complex (EJC) to regions
20 nucleotides upstream of exon-exon junctions. The EJC
remains bound to mRNAs during nuclear exit and through the
first round of ribosome passage, which is referred to as the
pioneering round of translation. Subsequent rounds do not
require EJC binding and involve different cap-binding proteins.
The EJC performs quality control on mRNAs by eliminating those
with premature termination codons (PTCs) (reviewed in Lejeune

Review
and Maquat, 2005) and also enhances protein synthesis of
normal mRNAs (Gudikote et al., 2005; Nott et al., 2004; Wiegand
et al., 2003). In response to phosphorylation by mTORC1, S6K1
is recruited to newly spliced mRNAs by its substrate and binding
partner SKAR, which also binds the EJC. Recruitment of S6K1 to
the EJC leads to phosphorylation of numerous mRNA-binding
proteins and correlates with increased translational efficiency
of spliced mRNAs (Ma et al., 2008).
Autophagy
Autophagy is a recycling process through which cells liberate
intracellular stores of nutrients by degrading cytoplasmic
proteins and organelles in lysosomes. In mammalian cells the
primary form of autophagy is macroautophagy (referred to
from now on as autophagy) and requires the formation of
double-membrane autophagosomes that sequester cytoplasmic components and then fuse with lysosomes (Klionsky,
2007; Kroemer et al., 2010, this issue). A major regulator of
autophagy is mTORC1, which in the presence of nutrients and
growth factors strongly inhibits the initiation of autophagy
(Noda and Ohsumi, 1998). Autophagy is upregulated during
periods of starvation or growth factor withdrawal, as well as in
response to oxidative stress, infection, or the accumulation of
protein aggregates. While mTORC1 inhibition triggers autophagy, the release of amino acids from autophagic protein degradation eventually leads to the reactivation of mTORC1, which
in turn restores the cellular lysosomal population (Yu et al.,
2010). Directly downstream of mTORC1 are numerous proteins
that are required for the execution of the autophagic program,
including the serine/threonine kinase Atg1/ULK, which plays
a key role in the formation of the preautophagosome (Kamada
et al., 2000). ULK1 forms a complex with Atg13 and FIP200,
which promote ULK1 kinase activity and localization to the preautophagosome (Ganley et al., 2009). mTORC1 phosphorylates
ULK1 and Atg13, moderately reducing ULK1 kinase activity but
not affecting its association with Atg13 and FIP200. Reports
conflict about whether mTORC1 binds to the complex under
nutrient-replete conditions, and more evidence is needed to
determine the role mTORC1 phosphorylation of ULK1 plays in
its subcellular localization and interaction with other autophagy
proteins. As a result, it is too early to know whether these
phosphorylation events fully explain the control of autophagy
by mTORC1 (Ganley et al., 2009; Hosokawa et al., 2009; Jung
et al., 2009). Interfering with the ability of cells to undergo
autophagy within an intact animal produces a range of phenotypes that underscore the importance of autophagy not only as
an adaptive response to nutrient stress, but also in general cell
and tissue housekeeping. For example, mice lacking Atg5, which
is required for autophagosome formation, are born at mendelian
ratios, but die within 1 day of delivery because they are unable
to mobilize the energy and nutrient stores they require to survive
the pre-suckling period (Kuma et al., 2004). Mice depleted of
Atg5 in just neural cells exhibit a progressive decline in motor
activity that correlates with the buildup of protein aggregates in
neurons, indicating that autophagy is essential for the basal
clearance of these aggregates and to maintain proper neuronal
function in adult animals (Hara et al., 2006). Tissue-specific
deletions of additional genes required for autophagy have
uncovered roles for autophagy in cardiac contractility, immune

cell function, and the liver detoxification of drugs (Levine and
Kroemer, 2008).
Metabolism
As a sensor of nutrient and growth factor levels, it is not
surprising that mTORC1 also controls numerous metabolic pathways. Although this area of mTOR research is still in its infancy, it
appears that mTORC1 can regulate a variety of metabolic
pathways in several tissue types and at the transcriptional, translational, and posttranslational levels (reviewed in Polak and Hall,
2009). In lymphoma cells, inhibition of mTORC1 by rapamycin
changes the levels of many mRNAs encoding metabolic
enzymes, including those involved in glycolysis, as well as in
amino acid, sterol, lipid, and nucleotide metabolism (Peng
et al., 2002). Recent work combining metabolite profiling and
gene expression analyses of cultured cells also found that
mTORC1 regulates glycolysis and sterol and lipid biosynthesis
but in addition identified the pentose phosphate pathway as
under the control of mTORC1 (Du¨vel et al., 2010). Many reports
show that mTORC1 activates the SREBP-1 transcription factor
(Du¨vel et al., 2010; Peng et al., 2002; Porstmann et al., 2008),
which belongs to the family of sterol regulatory element binding
proteins (SREBPs) that mediate the effects of sterols on the
expression of enzymes involved in lipid and cholesterol homeostasis (Yokoyama et al., 1993). Intact SREBP-1 is found in an
inactive state in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In response to
stimuli such as decreased sterol levels, insulin, or saturated fatty
acids, SREBP-1 is escorted from the ER to the Golgi, where it is
processed into an active form. Active SREBP-1 then translocates to the nucleus, where it transactivates promoters containing sterol regulatory elements and E-box sequences (Brown and
Goldstein, 1997). mTORC1 increases SREBP-1 activity at least
in part by promoting its posttranslational processing via S6K1,
which in turn leads to the increased transcription of genes
involved in sterol and lipid biosynthesis and the oxidative arm
of the pentose-phosphate pathway (Du¨vel et al., 2010).
mTORC1-mediated upregulation of SREBP-1 activity is necessary for lipogenesis induced by Akt (Porstmann et al., 2008).
mTORC1 also promotes the expression of the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) (see Majmundar et al., 2010), mostly by
regulating the translation, in a 4E-BP-dependent manner, of
the alpha subunit of HIF (Brugarolas et al., 2003; Du¨vel et al.,
2010; Hudson et al., 2002; Zhong et al., 2000). HIF activates
the transcription of 100–200 genes involved in cellular metabolism and the adaptation of cells to hypoxic conditions (Goldberg
et al., 1988; Shweiki et al., 1992), and mTORC1-dependent activation of Hif-1a is sufficient to upregulate these genes (Du¨vel
et al., 2010). The emerging theme is that the regulation of HIF
and SREBP-1 by mTORC1 is an important mechanism through
which cells coordinate carbohydrate and lipid metabolism with
the availability of nutrients.
mTORC1 also appears to be an important regulator of mitochondrial number and function. Inhibition of mTORC1 by
rapamycin lowers mitochondrial membrane potential, oxygen
consumption, and cellular ATP levels and profoundly alters the
mitochondrial phosphoproteome (Schieke et al., 2006).
Conversely, hyperactivation of mTORC1 increases mitochondrial DNA copy number, as well as the expression of many
genes encoding proteins involved in oxidative metabolism

Molecular Cell

Review
(Cunningham et al., 2007). In murine skeletal muscle, the lack of
raptor reduces the expression of genes involved in mitochondrial
biogenesis and leads to a concomitant loss of oxidative capacity
(Bentzinger et al., 2008). Cunningham and colleagues found that
mTORC1 promotes the transcriptional activity of PPARg coactivator 1 (PGC1a), a nuclear cofactor that plays a key role in
mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative metabolism, by directly
altering its physical interaction with the yin-yang 1 (YY1)
transcription factor (Cunningham et al., 2007). The direct interaction between mTORC1, PGC1a, and YY1 is somewhat at odds
with fractionation and imaging studies that show little to no
endogenous mTORC1 in the nucleus (Rosner and Hengstschla¨ger, 2008; Sancak et al., 2008). In general, how mTORC1
signaling impinges upon transcriptional networks remains
a poorly understood process. As evidence mounts demonstrating that mTORC1 regulates the function of important
transcription factors such as SREBP1, PGC1a, PPARg, and
p53, much more work is needed to fully understand how
mTORC1 and its substrates signal to transcription factors.
Consistent with the changes in gene expression that occur in
cultured cells upon mTORC1 manipulation, transgenic mice with
mutations in S6K1 or the 4E-BPs exhibit profound metabolic
alterations. S6K1-null mice are hypoinsulinemic as a result of
decreased b cell mass (Pende et al., 2000) but are also hypersensitive to insulin signaling. The combination of the decrease in
mTORC1 signaling and insulin levels with the hypersensitivity
to insulin makes S6K1-null mice resistant to diet- and ageinduced obesity (Um et al., 2004). Despite not affecting food
intake, the loss of S6K1 prevents fat accumulation by increasing
the lipolysis of triglycerides from adipose stores and the oxidation of fatty acids in fat and muscle. Mice deficient for both
4E-BP1 and 4E-BP2 have the opposite phenotype. While these
mice are viable and appear to develop normally, they have
a propensity to become obese and gain 30% more weight
than controls when fed a normal diet over the course of 16 weeks
(Le Bacquer et al., 2007). These mice also have an increase in
adipose tissue and plasma insulin and cholesterol levels, thus
establishing them as a model for the development of obesity.
Regulation of mTORC1 by Upstream Signals
A variety of upstream signals regulate mTORC1 activity,
including growth factors and amino acids, glucose, and oxygen
levels. Regulation of mTORC1 by most signals occurs primarily
through two types of mechanisms: the direct modification of
mTORC1 components or the regulation of Rheb, a small GTPase
that, when bound to GTP, directly interacts with and activates
mTORC1 (Long et al., 2005; Sancak et al., 2007). Amino acid
signaling to mTORC1 occurs through an interesting pathway
that requires Rheb, but also the Rag GTPases, and is discussed
below in its own section. While flies have only one Rheb,
mammals have Rheb1 and Rheb2, of which only Rheb1 has
been extensively studied. The intracellular location of Rheb is
poorly defined, but it appears to be present on the endomembrane system of cells with at least some on lysosomal
membranes, where, in the presence of amino acids, it is joined
by mTORC1. Below, we describe how distinct upstream signals
affect mTORC1 through Rheb and the Rag GTPases and by
modifying mTORC1 components.

Growth Factor Sensing
The blood levels of growth factors such as insulin and IGF-1
reflect the fed status of the organism. When food is plentiful,
levels of these growth factors are sustained and promote
anabolic cell processes such as translation, lipid biosynthesis,
and nutrient storage via mTORC1 (Figure 1). The binding of
insulin to its cognate tyrosine kinase receptor recruits insulin
receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) to the receptor and activates phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), which through the production of
phosphatidylinositol
(3,4,5)-triphosphate
[PtdIns(3,4,5)P3]
recruits Akt to the plasma membrane, where it becomes activated by direct phosphorylation by PDK1 and mTORC2. Akt,
along with other kinases downstream of growth factor signaling,
such as MAPK and p90 RSK1, phosphorylates TSC2 (Ballif et al.,
2005; Li et al., 2003; Potter et al., 2002; Roux et al., 2004;
Tee et al., 2003a). TSC2 (also known as tuberin) is the GTPaseactivating protein (GAP) for Rheb, and together with its partner
TSC1 (also known as hamartin) forms the heterodimeric
tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). Tsc1 and Tsc2, when lost,
lead to the development of tuberous sclerosis complex, a tumor

Review
syndrome characterized by the appearance in a variety of tissues
of benign tumors containing large cells (Kwiatkowski and
Manning, 2005; Orlova and Crino, 2010). When active, TSC2
inhibits mTORC1 by promoting the conversion of Rheb-GTP to
Rheb-GDP (Inoki et al., 2003a; Tee et al., 2003b). The phosphorylation of TSC2 in response to growth factors correlates with an
increase in mTORC1 activation, but exactly how TSC2
phosphorylation leads to its repression is unclear. The initial
assumption was that the phosphorylation of TSC2 by Akt would
directly suppress its GAP activity toward Rheb, but in vitro
assays have not confirmed this, and it is still unclear exactly
how the GAP function of TSC2 is regulated. Inoki et al. observed
a weakened interaction between Akt-phosphorylated TSC2 and
TSC1 in mammalian cells, which lead to ubiquitin-mediated
degradation of TSC2 (Inoki et al., 2002). Recent work shows
that hypophosphorylated TSC2 is present within the membrane
fraction of cells, where it interacts with TSC1 (Cai et al., 2006).
Phosphorylation of TSC2 by Akt promotes 14-3-3 binding and
the subsequent sequestration of TSC2 in the cytosolic fraction
away from TSC1, which, along with Rheb, likely remain in the
membrane compartment (Cai et al., 2006). This shift from
a membrane to cytosolic compartment correlates with the
inhibition of TSC2 function and activation of mTORC1 but has
not yet been proven to be the key regulatory event. In contrast,
Manning et al. immunoprecipitated TSC2 from PDGF-stimulated
cells and found that, over time, Akt phosphorylation of TSC2 did
not alter its interaction with TSC1 (Manning et al., 2002).
Similarly, in Drosophila cells, expression of a TSC2 mutant
having residues normally phosphorylated by Akt changed to
either alanine or phospho-mimicking amino acids, interacted
with TSC1 to the same extent as wild-type TSC2 (Dong and
Pan, 2004). Remarkably, both mutants of TSC2 sufficiently
rescued the growth defects in Tsc2-null mutants, indicating
a key difference between flies and mammals in growth regulation
by Akt via the TSC complex (Dong and Pan, 2004). Further
molecular analysis of TSC1 and TSC2 is needed before
a consensus can be reached regarding its repression by growth
factor signaling.
Growth factors also regulate mTORC1 through mechanisms
that are independent of TSC. Growth factor-activated Akt phosphorylates PRAS40, relieving its repression of mTORC1 (Oshiro
et al., 2007; Sancak et al., 2007; Thedieck et al., 2007; Vander
Haar et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2007).
In TSC2-null cells, GTP-loaded Rheb can overcome the repressive actions of PRAS40, indicating an unequal balance in these
two points of regulation of mTORC1 (Sancak et al., 2007). Activation of mTORC1 in response to growth factors also correlates
with phospholipase-D (PLD)-dependent accumulation of
phosphatidic acid (PA). RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated
depletion of PLD1 moderately inhibits mTORC1, and PA has
been shown to bind directly to the FRB domain of mTOR (Fang
et al., 2003; Fang et al., 2001; Foster, 2009; Sun et al., 2008).
Recent data demonstrate that loss of TSC2 or overexpression
of Rheb-GTP can activate PLD1, indicating that PA activation
of mTORC1 may not be fully independent of TSC (Sun et al.,
2008). A full understanding of the importance of this mechanism
requires more analysis because PA is not sufficient on its own to
activate mTORC1, has no effect on its kinase activity in vitro,
314 Molecular Cell 40, October 22, 2010 ª2010 Elsevier Inc.

and, like other upstream inputs, requires the presence of amino
acids (Fang et al., 2001).
Attenuated growth factor signaling represses mTORC1
activity, which downregulates nutrient and energy use and helps
cells survive periods of starvation and intermittent fasting.
Indeed, many organisms mutant for growth factors or their
receptors can tolerate greater levels of stress, have an increased
life span, and are frequently resistant to metabolic disease. Lossof-function mutations in the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) in mice or its
orthologs in flies (InR) and worms (DAF-2) promote longevity,
with female Igf-1R heterozygous mice living 33% longer than
controls (Guarente and Kenyon, 2000; Holzenberger et al.,
2003). The degree that suppression of mTORC1 contributes to
the increased life span of IGF-1R heterozygous mice is not
known, but it is interesting to note that rapamycin treatment of
mice also increased life span (Harrison et al., 2009).
Hyperactivation of growth factor signaling is associated with
decreased tolerance to multiple stresses, as well as cancer,
cardiac hypertrophy, and neuronal dysfunction. Hyperactivation
of mTORC1 caused by loss of TSC1 or TSC2 blocks cells from
initiating appropriate responses to growth factor deprivation,
such as autophagy, and triggers processes such as ER stress.
The induction of ER stress leads to increased reactive oxygen
species (ROS) production and apoptosis in fibroblasts, kidney
tumors, and neurons (Di Nardo et al., 2009; Ozcan et al., 2008).
In future work, it will be important to understand how the
increased stress levels of cells lacking TSC1 or TSC2 contributes
to the development and progression of tumors in patients with
tuberous sclerosis.
Upon being activated by growth factors, mTORC1 limits the
extent of growth factor signaling via what the mTOR field calls
the ‘‘negative feedback loop.’’ However, in contrast to classic
feedback loops where a threshold is reached before inhibition
occurs, mTORC1 seems to suppress growth factor signaling
in a more gradual and continual fashion. Accordingly, acute
rapamycin treatment leads to enhanced PI3K signaling,
whereas, as expected, constitutively active mTORC1 signaling
continually suppresses PI3K signaling (Harrington et al., 2004).
There appear to be multiple mechanisms through which the
negative feedback loop is initiated. In one well-characterized
mechanism, S6K1 reduces IRS1 activity and expression by
phosphorylating it, which interferes with its binding to the insulin
receptor, promotes its degradation, and decreases the levels of
its mRNA (Harrington et al., 2004; Shah and Hunter, 2006;
Tremblay et al., 2007). Activated S6K1 can also suppress the
activity of other growth factor receptors that do not rely on
IRS1, such as platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR),
indicating that additional targets besides IRS1 must exist (Zhang
et al., 2003). In another mechanism, mTORC1 directly interacts
with IRS1 via Raptor and phosphorylates IRS1 at sites that interfere with its association with PI3K (Tzatsos, 2009).
Given the role of insulin and insulin-related growth factors in
metabolic disorders and cancer, the negative input from
mTORC1 to the insulin pathway likely has clinical implications.
For example, the relatively poor ability of rapamycin to slow
tumor growth in cancer patients may be because by relieving
the feedback signal the drug increases PI3K activity, a known
promoter of cell proliferation and survival (O’Reilly et al., 2006).

through Multiple Pathways
Black lines signify activating connections, whereas red

known to be direct.

The differential effects of rapamycin on tumor growth may also
reflect in part the varying effects of rapamycin on mTORC2
and its substrates Akt and SGK. Normally, acute rapamycin
treatment is unable to inhibit mTORC2, likely because mTORC2
components prevent the binding of rapamycin-FKBP12 to
mTOR by obscuring its FRB domain. However, in certain cell
types, chronic exposure of rapamycin leads to inhibition of
mTORC2, as well as of its best-known substrates, Akt and
SGK. In these cells, disassociation and/or assembly of mTORC2
occurs in a manner that allows rapamycin-FKBP12 to bind free
mTOR, which interferes with assembly of mTORC2 components
(Sarbassov et al., 2006). Our inability to understand why certain
tumors are sensitive to rapamycin precludes identification of
a biomarker that would help in selecting patients who could
benefit from the drug.
Multicellular organisms use growth factor signaling to communicate the fed status of the organism to their cells, but individual
cells also retain systems that sense the levels of specific nutrients, such as carbohydrates and amino acids. Below, we
describe the molecular underpinnings of how the mTORC1
pathway senses specific nutrients.
Glucose and Energy Sensing
Glucose deprivation leads to decreased glycolytic flux, which, by
lowering ATP levels, inhibits mTORC1 (Figure 2). Depletion of
cellular ATP by the hexokinase inhibitor, 2-deoxy-glucose
(2DG), or the mitochondrial uncoupler, FCCP, inhibits mTORC1
in wild-type cells but not in those lacking TSC2 (Inoki et al.,
2003b; Kimura et al., 2003). The signaling of low ATP levels to
TSC2 requires the 50 AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK).
Decreased ATP production, and therefore an increase in the
AMP/ATP ratio, activates AMPK, a heterotrimeric kinase
composed of a catalytic (a) and two regulatory (b and g) subunits
(Kahn et al., 2005). AMP binds AMPK and puts the trimer in

a conformation that allows the kinase subunit
to be phosphorylated by the upstream activating
kinase LKB1 (Sanders et al., 2007), thus slowing
cell growth and its many ATP-consuming
processes (Shaw, 2009). AMPK directly phosphorylates TSC2, which through an unknown
mechanism leads to its activation and thus to
the suppression of mTORC1 (Corradetti et al.,
2004; Inoki et al., 2003b; Shaw et al., 2004)
and is vital for cell survival under glucose deprivation conditions (Inoki et al., 2003b).
Energy depletion may inhibit mTORC1 independently of TSC2 in Drosophila, where dTSC2
lacks the AMPK phosphorylation sites (Kalender
et al., 2010), and there is evidence that TSC2independent mechanisms also exist in mammalian cells (Gwinn et al., 2008). This mechanism
is mediated in part by the direct phosphorylation by AMPK of
raptor on two serine residues that are conserved throughout
evolution. These phosphorylation events induce 14-3-3 to bind
raptor and inhibit, again through an unknown mechanism, the
kinase activity of mTORC1 (Gwinn et al., 2008). The inhibition of
mTORC1 caused by the AMPK-mediated phosphorylation of
raptor is required for cell-cycle arrest in response to energy stress.
Drugs that trigger the cellular stress response to a high AMP/
ATP ratio have long been used to treat diabetes, and recent
research has focused on their potential use as anticancer
agents. Drugs such as metformin and phenformin decrease
ATP levels through the inhibition of mitochondrial respiration,
which, through unclear mechanisms, relieves hyperglycemia in
diabetics by promoting insulin-dependent glucose uptake in
peripheral tissues while decreasing hepatic glucose production
(Bailey and Turner, 1996). Activation of AMPK and subsequent
inhibition of mTORC1 occurs in response to these drugs, but
the contribution of this signaling pathway to the antidiabetic
effects of the drugs remains unclear (Foretz et al., 2010; Shaw
et al., 2005). A recent report indicates that, even in the absence
of AMPK, these drugs can inhibit mTORC1 and increase glucose
uptake in L6 myotubes, indicating that additional mechanisms
may exist through which altered AMP/ATP ratios affect mTORC1
signaling (Kalender et al., 2010).
Oxygen Sensing
Low oxygen levels, or hypoxia, inhibit mTORC1 signaling
through multiple mechanisms (Figure 2). Hypoxia decreases
cellular ATP levels by inhibiting metabolic programs such as
oxidative phosphorylation and as a result activates AMPK, which
inhibits mTORC1 via TSC2 and raptor phosphorylation as
described above. Hypoxia also represses mTORC1 through
the actions of Redd1/RTP801/ DDIT4—first characterized in
Drosophila as Scylla and Charybdis (Brugarolas et al., 2004;

Review
Reiling and Hafen, 2004). These genes encode hypoxia-inducible transcripts that suppress mTORC1 in a poorly understood
fashion. Redd1 is a 232 amino acid cytoplasmic protein with
no recognizable domains, and genetic studies have placed its
activation of TSC2 and consequent inhibition of mTORC1 in
a parallel pathway to AMPK and PI3K (Sofer et al., 2005). It has
been posited that Redd1 inhibits mTORC1 by controlling the
release of TSC2 from its growth factor-induced association
with 14-3-3, thereby stabilizing the interaction between TSC1
and TSC2 (DeYoung et al., 2008; Vega-Rubin-de-Celis et al.,
2010). Many other insults besides hypoxia, including energy
depletion, DNA damage, glucocorticoids, and oxidizing agents,
also induce Redd1 (Ellisen et al., 2002; Wang et al., 2003),
suggesting a broad role for Redd1 in conveying stress signals
to mTORC1. Interestingly, cigarette smoke also induces
Redd1, which may mediate smoking-induced lung injury by
inhibiting mTORC1 and enhancing oxidative stress-induced
cell death (Yoshida et al., 2010). In addition to AMPK and
Redd1, there are reports of additional pathways through which
hypoxia suppresses mTORC1 but that require confirmation
and further follow up. For example, the promyelocytic leukemia
tumor suppressor (PML) has been reported to bind mTOR and
inactivate it through sequestration in nuclear bodies during
hypoxia (Bernardi et al., 2006). Similarly, the hypoxia-inducible
proapoptotic protein BNIP3 (BCl2/adenovirus E1B 19 kDa
protein-interacting protein 3) may bind and inhibit Rheb1
(Li et al., 2007). The multiple pathways through which hypoxia
suppresses mTORC1 indicate the importance to cells of this
adaptive response.
Amino Acid Sensing
Cells respond to the stress of amino acid deprivation through the
induction and suppression of multiple systems. Decreased
intake of amino acids deprives the cell of substrates needed
for protein synthesis as well as intermediates for feeding the
TCA cycle and other metabolic processes. Low levels of amino
acids inhibit TORC1 signaling in a wide range of organisms
from yeast to mammals. In flies, deletion of dTOR mimics amino
acid withdrawal by inhibiting larval growth and causing the
accumulation of lipid vesicles in the larval fat body that
reflects the breakdown and mobilization of stored nutrients
(Britton and Edgar, 1998; Oldham et al., 2000; Zhang et al.,
2000). In C. elegans, deletion of the intestinal amino acid transporter pep-2 inhibits ceTOR and insulin signaling and, by attenuating postembryonic growth, reduces body length and the
number of progeny. While reducing growth, the inhibition of
ceTOR also increases the ability of worms to withstand stresses
such as heat and oxidative damage (Meissner et al., 2004).
In mammals, the protein composition of the diet influences
the development of lean body mass, weight control, satiety,
insulin sensitivity, and bone and cardiovascular health (Millward
et al., 2008). The removal of individual amino acids from cells
growing in culture inhibits mTORC1 by variable amounts with
leucine or arginine withdrawal most closely phenocopying total
amino acid deprivation (Hara et al., 1998). Moreover, amino
acids sometimes affect each other in unexpected ways.
For example, the transport of the leucine that is important for
activating mTORC1 requires the efflux of glutamine via the bidirectional transporter SLC7A5 (Nicklin et al., 2009).

Fasting, intense exercise, and many systemic diseases exert
stress upon skeletal muscle, resulting in decreased protein
synthesis, increased protein degradation, and branch chain
amino acid oxidation (Lecker et al., 1999; Norton and Layman,
2006). Many reports hypothesize that inhibition of mTORC1
contributes to the manifestation of these stress-related phenotypes (Khamzina et al., 2005; Kimball et al., 2000; Lang et al.,
2010; McGhee et al., 2009). Modulation of mTORC1 in muscle
probably occurs downstream of amino acids, in particular
leucine, as well as insulin and IGF-1 signaling. Muscle-specific
ablation of the mTORC1 component raptor confirmed the important role mTORC1 plays in balancing catabolic and anabolic
cellular programs. Raptor-deficient muscles are small, become
progressively more dystrophic and have altered metabolic
function, including increased oxidative capacity (Bentzinger
et al., 2008).
Amino acid signaling to mTORC1 remains poorly understood,
but some of the key players are beginning to be uncovered
(Kim et al., 2008; Sancak et al., 2008) (Figure 2). An essential
step appears to be the amino acid-induced recruitment of
mTORC1 to lysosomal membranes, where it can interact with
a pool of Rheb that also appears to reside on this compartment
(Sancak et al., 2010; Sancak et al., 2008). Lysosomal
membranes contain a multimeric complex consisting of MP1,
p14, and p18, which has been termed Ragulator (Sancak et al.,
2010). This complex acts as a scaffold for a heterodimer of
Rag GTPases of which there are four (RagA, RagB, RagC, and
RagD). RagA and RagB are functionally redundant and interact
with either RagC or RagD, which are also functionally redundant,
to form a Rag heterodimer, which appears to constitutively
reside on lysosomal membranes. The loading of the Rags with
GTP or GDP appears to be regulated by amino acids. In cells
deprived of amino acids, RagA/B is bound to GDP and RagC/D
to GTP. Stimulation of cells with amino acids leads to a flipping,
via an unknown mechanism, of the bound nucleotide so that
RagA/B and RagC/D become GTP and GDP bound, respectively. This is the active state of the Rag heterodimer, which,
through its interaction with raptor, serves as a docking site for
mTORC1 on the lysosomal surface (Sancak et al., 2008). There,
mTORC1 is proposed to interact with the lysosomal pool of
Rheb-GTP. Because Rheb is required for the activation of
mTORC1 by all upstream inputs, the amino acid-dependent
recruitment of mTORC1 to the lysosomal surface should be
necessary for activating mTORC1 by all signals (Sancak et al.,
2010; Sancak et al., 2008). Indeed, loss of TSC1 or TSC2 does
not activate mTORC1 in the absence of amino acids or Rag or
Ragulator function (Kim et al., 2008; Sancak et al., 2008;
Smith et al., 2005), and forced recruitment of mTORC1 to
Rheb-containing lysosomes makes mTORC1 shed its requirement for amino acids, the Rag GTPases, and the Ragulator.
Genetic and RNAi studies indicate that the Rag GTPases and
the Ragulator are absolutely necessary for amino acids to
activate mTORC1. Conversely, overexpression of just a mutant
of RagB that is constitutively bound to GTP is sufficient to activate mTORC1 in amino acid-free media and in response to metformin (Kalender et al., 2010; Sancak et al., 2010). Interestingly,
metformin treatment phenocopies the effects of amino acid
deprivation on the localization of mTORC1, thus suggesting

Molecular Cell

Review
that this drug may inhibit mTORC1 via modulation of Rag
signaling (Kalender et al., 2010). Further work is needed to determine whether the results found with metformin represent a novel
pathway through which lowered ATP levels inhibit mTORC1
independently of AMPK.
Several additional upstream factors have been proposed to
participate in amino acid signaling to mTORC1. Using doublestranded RNA (dsRNA) screens in Drosophila cells, the Lamb
group identified a role for the Ste-20 related kinase Map4k3 in
the activation of mTORC1 (Findlay et al., 2007). In cell culture
models, knockdown of Map4k3 prevents the activation of
mTORC1 by amino acids, whereas overexpression delays the
inhibition of mTORC1 by amino acid withdrawal. It is unclear
where in the pathway of amino acid activation Map4K3 lies
and, in data not shown of a subsequent paper, the authors find
that suppression of the Rag GTPases blunts the ability of
Map4k3 to activate mTORC1, indicating that Map4k3 may act
upstream of the Rag GTPases (Yan et al., 2010). Whether
Map4k3 directly acts on the Rag GTPases to help recruit
mTORC1 to the lysosomes is unclear. While one report showed
a direct interaction between Map4k3 and RagA and RagC in
Drosophila S2 cells (Bryk et al., 2010), another found no evidence
for this interaction (Yan et al., 2010). Flies mutant for Map4k3 are
viable, leaner, and show growth defects that are correlated with
reduced, but not abrogated, mTORC1 signaling (Bryk et al.,
2010). For more on nutrient sensing see Wellen and Thompson
(2010) in this issue.
DNA Damage Sensing
Damage to DNA induces responses that enable cells to repair
themselves or activate programmed cell death (Ciccia and
Elledge, 2010, this issue). It is now appreciated that mTORC1
inhibition is an important part of the cellular response to DNA
damage and mTORC1 hyperactivation caused by TSC1 or
TSC2 deficiency sensitizes cells to the effects of DNA damage
(Ghosh et al., 2006). Central to the coordination of DNA damage
responses is the tumor suppressor, p53 (Riley et al., 2008;
Vousden and Ryan, 2009). Multiple mechanisms have been
proposed for how p53 inhibits mTORC1 in response to DNA
damage. p53 induces the transcription of PTEN, TSC2, and
Redd1, which all act to inhibit mTORC1 as discussed earlier
(Ellisen et al., 2002; Feng et al., 2005; Stambolic et al., 2001).
p53 also transactivates Sestrin1 and Sestrin 2, which can
repress mTORC1 via AMPK-dependent regulation of the
TSC1/TSC2 complex (Budanov and Karin, 2008; Feng et al.,
2005) (Figure 2). Chronic activation of the Drosophila TOR
homolog, dTOR, was also found to lead to Sestrin accumulation
(Lee et al., 2010), suggesting a negative feedback on dTOR
activation. In addition to repressing mTORC1 via transcriptional
targets, there is indirect evidence that p53 causes a rapid
decrease in translation initiation partly by regulating the
phosphorylation of S6K and 4E-BP1 (Horton et al., 2002). These
multiple mechanisms suggest that the induction of p53 upon
genotoxic stress can repress mTORC1 at multiple levels (Ellisen
et al., 2002; Feng et al., 2005; Stambolic et al., 2001).

stresses, including DNA damage as well as drops in the levels
of energy, glucose, amino acids, and oxygen. These stress
responses impact a wide variety of both pathological and physiological states, such as aiding in the resistance of tumor cells to
conventional therapy and modulating life span. Additional work
is needed to understand how mTORC1 function and activity
vary temporally during the course of a stress and the mechanisms that reset mTORC1 signaling once a stress subsides.
A good example of the former comes from new insights into
the role of mTORC1 during autophagy (Yu et al., 2010). Amino
acid deprivation inhibits mTORC1, which then leads to the induction of autophagy. Over time, however, the autophagic process
liberates amino acids, which reactivate mTORC1 and whose
activity then promotes the replacement of lysosomes consumed
during autophagy. mTORC1 is likely to orchestrate similarly
elegant long term responses to the other stresses it senses.
A better understanding of how stress responses impinge upon
mTORC1 as a function of time may inform the timing and dosage
of therapeutics aimed at manipulating mTORC1 activity in
various disease states.

Conclusion
An emerging view is that the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) protein
kinase is a critical mediator of the cellular response to many
