triplet state and the electronic ground state. Moreover, as is discussed on the basis of an extensive data
set, summarized for the ﬁrst time, the efﬁciency of SOC also depends on the geometry of a complex. The
investigations are exempliﬁed and supported by instructive case studies, such as efﬁcient blue and very
efﬁcient green and red emitters. Additionally, trends being important for applications of these compounds
as emitters in OLEDs are worked out. In particular, the properties of the emitters are discussed with respect
to the harvesting of singlet and triplet excitons that are generated in the course of the electroluminescence
process. The well-known triplet harvesting effect is compared to the recently discovered singlet harvesting
effect. This latter mechanism is illustrated by use of a blue light emitting Cu(I) complex, which represents
an efﬁcient ﬂuorescent emitter at ambient temperature. By this mechanism, 100% of the generated singlet
and triplet excitons can, at least in principle, be harvested by the emitting singlet state. Potentially, this
new mechanism can successfully be applied in future OLED lighting with a distinctly reduced roll-off of
the efﬁciency.

1. Introduction
During the past decade, the scientiﬁc interests in understanding the lowest triplet state T1 of organo-transition metal complexes
increased strongly. This was stimulated by the wide range of applications. In particular, these materials are used as emitters in highly
efﬁcient OLEDs (organic light-emitting diodes) [1–8] and LEECs
(light-emitting electro-chemical cells) [9–12], light absorbers in
dye-sensitized solar cells [13–16], chemo- and biosensors [17–21],
lumophores for cell imaging [21–24], chemical photo-catalysts
[25–28], etc. In spite of all these applications, in which the lowest
triplet state is involved, an understanding of its properties is much
less common or even less developed than for pure organic materials
[29,30]. Thus, it seems to be justiﬁed to focus on the triplet states’
properties of these metal complexes. Moreover, since the authors’
interests are strongly related to material development for OLED
applications, the discussion will also focus on demands that are
imposed by the use of these materials for efﬁcient light generation
in electro-luminescent devices.
In this contribution, we introduce in Section 2 important effects,
such as triplet harvesting and singlet harvesting which both, at least
in principle, allow for a complete gathering of all excitons formed by
electron–hole recombination and their conversion into light. This
is in contrast to the situation as found for purely organic emitters,
which allow only to use up to 25% of the total number of excitons.
Moreover, in many discussions, electronic transitions are
described by excitations from the highest occupied molecular
orbitals (HOMOs) to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals
(LUMOs). These HOMO–LUMO considerations are frequently
indicative, since in suitable cases they can provide information
on some properties of the lowest excited states. However, the
HOMO–LUMO concept does not contain energy states, such as singlets or triplets. Therefore, in Section 3 relations between the two
descriptions, i.e. MO model versus state model, will be discussed. In
particular, the emission behavior is crucially determined by effects
of spin–orbit coupling (SOC) between the lowest triplet state (T1 )
and higher lying singlet and triplet states. These effects are difﬁcult to handle quantitatively, but simple guidelines resulting from
theoretical considerations can be worked out (Section 4). Additionally, guidelines and assessments based on experiments are given
that use the systematics of zero-ﬁeld splitting (ZFS) of the triplet
into substates (Section 6). For example, SOC determines these splittings as well as the radiative decay times of the transitions from the
T1 substates to the singlet ground state. In particular, these decay
times should be as short as possible for OLED emitters, but have to
be long for many sensor applications. In this respect, the mentioned
systematics is highly successful.
For most compounds, apart from only a few exceptions, the
phosphorescence quantum yield is signiﬁcantly lower than 100%
and mostly exhibits a distinct temperature dependence. In Section 5, we will present some insight into nonradiative deactivation

processes on an introductory level. Interestingly, also these effects
depend strongly on SOC. Further, the emission properties of the
compounds are controlled not only by purely electronic transitions,
but also by the involvement of vibrational modes. These determine
the spectral forms, color purities, photoluminescence quantum
yields, etc. The corresponding features will be addressed by presenting several case studies (Sections 7–9). We will also present
a series of emission data and trends to develop an understanding,
in particular, of how to vary photophysical properties by chemical
means. Several basic results or characterizations reveal themselves
only at cryogenic temperatures. At ambient temperature, at which
the materials are usually used, much information is lost simply because of smearing-out effects, such as homogeneous and/or
inhomogeneous spectral broadenings. Therefore, low-temperature
investigations, application of methods of high-resolution laser
spectroscopy, and time-resolved measurements are required for
the development of a deeper understanding of the materials’ properties. This will be demonstrated by examples and case studies. In
particular, the case study focusing on a Cu(I) complex (Section 9)
allows us to demonstrate the high potential of the singlet harvesting effect. A short conclusion ends this introductory contribution.

2. Triplet harvesting, singlet harvesting, and OLED
efﬁciency
In an electro-luminescence process, the population of excited
states occurs via a recombination of negatively charged electrons
and positively charged holes. They attract each other by Coulomb
interaction (Fig. 1a) and form excitons in the emission layer of an
OLED. Since both, hole and electron, have spins, four different spin
combinations are possible. According to quantum mechanics (compare for example [29–31]), one combination of antiparallel spins,
giving a singlet, and three combinations of parallel spins, giving a
triplet, occur. (Fig. 1b) Thus, in a statistical limit, 25% of the excitons
represent singlets and 75% triplets.
In suitable situations, a single charge carrier is trapped ﬁrst on
the emitter complex, oxidizing or reducing it. For example, for several OLEDs employing Ir(III) complexes, the hole is trapped ﬁrst
[32]. Subsequently, the electron is attracted and the exciton is
formed. The processes of population of an excited state of the emitter complex can be described to proceed via singlet (1 CT) and triplet
(3 CT) charge transfer states, as proposed by Yersin [33,34]. These
involve the emitter complex and the immediate environment,
which usually consists of organic host (matrix) molecules (Fig. 1c).
Because of the small SOC constants of the host molecules and the
very small energy splitting between the 1 CT and 3 CT states, it is
expected that the intersystem crossing (ISC) time between these
two states is signiﬁcantly longer than relaxation times to lower
lying states with the same multiplicity (internal conversion, IC).
These latter processes take place in about 10−12 s [30]. Therefore,

the lowest excited states proceeds via singlet and triplet charge transfer (CT) states
which involve the emitter and surrounding host molecules. (d) From these CT states

fast and separate relaxations without spin ﬂips are expected to populate the lowest excited singlet state S1 (one path) and the triplet
state T1 (three paths) of the emitter complex, respectively. (Fig. 1d)
Subsequently, ISC from the S1 to the T1 state can occur.
Based on these model considerations, we can now explain the
distinct differences between organic and organo-transition metal
emitters for OLED applications. The corresponding processes are
schematically displayed in Fig. 2. After the exciton is formed and the
relaxations by one singlet and three triplet paths have occurred, the
lowest excited singlet and triplet states are populated. This is valid
for organic as well as for organo-transition-metal emitter materials. The corresponding processes are schematically displayed in
Fig. 2b. The organic molecule can exhibit an efﬁcient and fast decaying singlet emission (S1 → S0 ) with lifetimes of the order of one ns
with a ﬂuorescence quantum yield of almost 100% [35–37], if the
S1 → T1 intersystem crossing rate is small compared to the ﬂuorescence rate. For organic molecules with 1,3 ␲␲* states, for example,
ISC times can be as long as 0.1 to 1 ␮s [30]. On the other hand, since
the probability for the radiative T1 → S0 transition is also very small,
the deactivation of the T1 state occurs normally non-radiatively at
ambient temperature. Therefore, 75% of the excitons, namely the
triplet excitons, are lost for the emission. Their energy is transferred
into heat (Fig. 2a). The conditions are more favorable for organotransition metal complexes, in which the central metal ion induces
signiﬁcant spin–orbit coupling (Fig. 2c). For these complexes, ISC
to the T1 state is usually very efﬁcient and thus, at an energy separation between the S1 and T1 states of several 103 cm−1 , a singlet
S1 emission is not observable. Moreover, the radiative T1 → S0 rate
can become relatively large for compounds with central metal ions
with large SOC constants so that efﬁcient phosphorescence with
a quantum yield of almost 100% can occur even at ambient temperature [38–40]. (For a more detailed discussion see Section 8.)
Consequently, all four possible spin orientations of the excitons can
be harvested and populate the lowest T1 state. By this process of
triplet harvesting one can, in principle, obtain a four times higher
electro-luminescence efﬁciency with phosphorescent triplet emitters than with ﬂuorescent singlet emitters.

For several compounds, in particular for a number of Ir(III) complexes, the average radiative decay rate kar v of all three triplet
substates is relatively large. For example, for Ir(ppy)3 (chemical
structure (52), compare Fig. 9) doped into PMMA, a value of kar v ≈
6.9 × 105 s−1 ( ar v = 1.4 ␮s) has been found at ambient temperature
(see also Section 8) [40]. Such high values are well suited for OLED
applications by taking advantage of the triplet harvesting effect.
However, many other organo-transition metal compounds
exhibit much lower average radiative rates for the T1 → S0 transition. In this situation, the emission decay times are relatively long,
if non-radiative processes do not lead to quenching. In this case,
saturation and/or triplet–triplet annihilation effects make these
materials disadvantageous for OLED applications, as will further be
discussed below. Interestingly, a new electro-luminescence mechanism, as recently proposed by Yersin et al. [41–46], can overcome
these problems in suitable situations. For these cases speciﬁc emitter materials are required. In particular, they should exhibit small
energy separations E(S1 − T1 ) between the lowest excited singlet state S1 and the triplet state T1 (small exchange interaction
integral) and should show an efﬁcient thermally activated delayed
ﬂuorescence, an effect which has already been well known for a
long time [30,47–51]. Fig. 2d displays this situation. After exciton
formation in an emission layer of an OLED, one singlet path and
three triplet paths populate both the S1 and the T1 state, respectively, similarly as described above. Again, induced by SOC, the ISC
processes downwards from S1 to T1 are fast. However, due to the
small energy separation E(S1 − T1 ), also upward processes from
T1 to S1 are effective at ambient temperature. Thus, emission of
both states can occur. As a result, the emission is governed by a
Boltzmann distribution according to Eq. (1):
Int(S1 → S0 )
kr (S1 → S0 )
= r
· exp −
Int(T1 → S0 )
k (T1 → S0 )

E(S1 − T1 )
kB T

(1)

Herein Int(S1 → S0 ) and Int(T1 → S0 ), kr (S1 → S0 ) and kr (T1 → S0 )
represent the ﬂuorescence and phosphorescence intensities and
the corresponding radiative rates, respectively. kB is the Boltzmann
constant and T the absolute temperature.
A numerical example may illustrate the advantage of this mechanism. Cu(I) complexes typically exhibit triplet emission decay
times (T1 → S0 ) of the order of 100 ␮s up to a few ms [52–54]. An
emitter with such a long decay time, e.g. of 1 ms, would not be suited
for OLED applications. However, at an energy separation of, for
example, E(S1 − T1 ) = 500 cm−1 and a ratio of radiative rate constants of kr (S1 → S0 )/kr (T1 → S0 ) = 104 , the intensity of the S1 → S0
ﬂuorescence at ambient temperature is by a factor of the order of
103 stronger than the intensity of the T1 → S0 phosphorescence,
according to Eq. (1). Under the same conditions, the measured emission decay time, i.e. the averaged decay time of the two states S1
and T1 , is reduced from 1 ms to about 1 ␮s (see Eq. (24)). This decay
time is attractively short and is similar to the value as found for
Ir(ppy)3 .
In conclusion, singlet emitters in OLEDs that take advantage of
the singlet harvesting effect by gathering both the triplet excitations
(induced by three triplet paths) and the singlet excitation (effected
by one singlet path) and by emitting a thermally activated ﬂuorescence, might be similarly well suited for OLED applications as the
already well established triplet emitter materials. In Section 9, we
will discuss a promising material in some detail.
Obviously, the photophysical properties of the emitter materials
are of crucial importance for the OLED performance. Here, we want
to discuss some factors that determine the electro-luminescence
efﬁciency. In particular, we want to focus on the impact of the emission decay time. Eq. (2) summarizes the dominating factors that

(2)

The factors involved in Eq. (2) have the following meanings:
•

out represents the optical outcoupling factor. OLEDs fabricated
on simple, planar glass substrates usually loose about 75–80%
of the generated light, mainly because of total reﬂections and
waveguiding, surface plasmon losses at the metallic electrodes,
etc. These effects prevent the light to leave the OLED device, giving
out ≈ 0.2 [57–61].
• ˇ is a factor that describes the ratio of excitons that lead to a population of luminescent states of the emitter molecule relative to the
total number of excitons formed by electron–hole recombination
[33,34,62]. For triplet harvesting and singlet harvesting materials, a
value of ˇ = 1 can be attained, while for purely organic ﬂuorescent
emitters, only a value of ˇ = 0.25 is achievable.
• is the charge balance factor [63,64]. It represents the fraction
of recombining charge carriers relative to the total number of
injected carriers. For OLEDs with well designed layers, a value
of almost = 1 can be reached [65]. However, the charge balance can depend strongly on the current density. In particular,
for high brightness lighting applications at high current densities, when, among other reasons [66], all emitter complexes
are excited and the emission layer is almost saturated, current
leakages are crucial and a value of
1 can result [67,68]. Consequently, a long luminescence decay time of the emitter is very
disadvantageous, because saturation is obtained at a relatively
low brightness and low current density, respectively. Therefore,
the use of compounds with short emission decay times is crucial to reduce the roll-off of efﬁciency with increasing brightness
[68,69].
• PL describes the photo-luminescence quantum yield, which is,
under the assumption of fast and quantitative intersystem crossing, given according to Eq. (3)

=

kr

kr
= kr
+ knr

(3)

where kr and knr are the radiative and nonradiative rate constants
and is the emission decay time. For OLED applications, PL should
be as high as possible and values higher than at least PL ≈ 40% are
targeted. This is not unreasonably high, since, for example, a PL
value of almost 100% is found for Ir(ppy)3 [38–40].
This simple equation already shows that for small kr values,
knr can easily dominate and this results in a drop of the quantum
yield. Consequently, the (radiative) emission decay rate should be
as high as possible. For example, the relatively high value of kar v ≈
6.9 × 105 s−1 , as found for the three triplet substates of Ir(ppy)3
(52) (in PMMA at 300 K) [40], is one of the reasons for a successful
application of this compound as OLED emitter (see also Section 8).
Obviously, consideration of the nonradiative rate is also crucial
for an optimization of an emitter material (compare Section 5). In
the scope of the present section, concerning the OLED performance
at higher brightness applications, knr should be replaced by
nr
knr = kemitter
+ knr (bimol)[j, c]

(4)

The ﬁrst term describes the usual nonradiative rate of an emitter in its environment at a speciﬁc temperature, while the second
term is added to take into account, for example, bimolecular
quenching due to triplet–triplet annihilation [67,68,70]. This type
of quenching usually becomes more important with increasing
current density j [71]. Also other quenching effects should not
be ignored, such as exciton–polaron quenching [66,67,72,73]. In
most cases, the quenching depends also on the concentration c of
the doped emitter complexes. For example, at high concentrations
triplet–triplet annihilation and self-quenching [74,75] become
more important. Most of these quenching processes have less
importance for compounds with short (radiative) emission decay
times.
Frequently, the OLED efﬁciency is measured in different, but
related quantities. The luminous efﬁciency Álum [lm/W] takes into

(pseudo)octahedral complex with low lying MLCT transitions. The HOMO–LUMO
excitation leads to four energy states, one 1 MLCT and three substates of 3 MLCT.

energy states. Here, the three substates of a triplet term are counted as three states.

account the wavelength dependent sensitivity of the human eye
(photopic response). Thus, an additional factor S( ) has to be introduced in Eq. (2) [7,56]. The photopic response peaks at a wavelength
of 555 nm, reaching a value of S(555 nm) = 683 lm/W [56]. Another
important quantity is the current efﬁciency Ácurr [cd/A], which is
given by the ratio of the luminous density [cd/m2 ] of an OLED to
the applied current density [A/m2 ] [64]. It is stressed that the performances of OLEDs that emit different colors cannot be compared
directly in terms of luminous efﬁciency or current efﬁciency, since
these parameters depend on the wavelength of the emitted light.
For that purpose, the external quantum efﬁciency, as given by Eq.
(2), is better suited.
In summary, the external quantum efﬁciency Áext without speciﬁc improvements of outcoupling can be as high as 20–25%
[69,76,77]. Moreover, the above discussions show that emitters
with high radiative decay rates (i.e. short radiative decay times)
represent preferred emitter materials for OLED applications. In the
subsequent sections, we will come back to these requirements from
a photo-physical as well as from a chemical structure point of view.
It is not excluded that in future singlet emitters, taking advantage of the singlet harvesting effect, might more easily meet the
requirements for bright OLED lighting.

3. HOMO–LUMO excitations and energy states
Frequently, it seems to be suitable to discuss electronic properties of organo-transition metal complexes on the basis of
HOMO–LUMO excitations. However, this can be misleading. For
example, such a simple model does not comprise singlet or triplet
states or, if these states are deduced just from the HOMO–LUMO
excitation, it might occur that the resulting triplet does not represent the one of lowest energy. In the scope of this section,
we want to present some useful considerations on a schematic
basis to help to develop a better understanding of excitations
between molecular orbitals (MOs) and how these relate to energy
states.

Fig. 3 displays a small number of frontier orbitals, which are
often expected to be mainly responsible for a qualitative description of the lower lying energy states. The diagram represents
orbitals for a quasi-octahedral organo-transition metal complex,
such as Ir(ppy)3 (52), with three chelating ligands that have ␲ and
␲* orbitals in the relevant energy range. Under assumption of a
symmetry of the complex lower than C3 , one obtains three ␲ and
three ␲* molecular orbitals. Moreover, three d-orbitals, representing the split t2g set, are also shown. The designation, particularly in
the range of the higher lying occupied MOs, gives only the leading
contribution of these MOs. For example, a d-orbital can also contain
␲-admixtures, or a ␲ orbital can be mixed with d-character. For the
discussions in this section, it is further assumed that the d* orbitals
have a very large energy separation from the ␲* MOs and therefore
do not interfere. However, for blue-light emitters, these orbitals
become important, since they may become involved in thermally
activated emission quenching (compare Section 5).
For the molecules being of interest here, each occupied orbital
contains two electrons with opposite spins. Thus, the conﬁguration ␲3 2 ␲2 2 ␲1 2 d3 2 d2 2 d1 2 gives the electronic singlet ground state
S0 . For example, a HOMO–LUMO excitation, representing an MLCT
(metal-to-ligand charge-transfer) transition, leads to the excited
state conﬁguration ␲3 2 ␲2 2 ␲1 2 d3 2 d2 2 d1 1 ␲1 *1 . For simplicity, let us
designate this excitation as d1 ␲1 * or MLCT1 excitation. (According
to extensive mixtures between the orbitals, as mentioned above,
the overall amount of charge transfer from the metal to the ligands
may be rather small even in the case of a formal MLCT excitation.) Taking the spins and spin ﬂips into account, one obtains one
singlet state (1 d1 ␲1 * or 1 MLCT1 ) and one triplet state (3 d1 ␲1 * or
3 MLCT ). Similarly as described in Section 2 and Fig. 1, the triplet
1
term (=state) consists of three substates. Considering additionally electron–electron interaction (exchange interaction) between
the electrons in the two orbitals (d1 and ␲1 *), the singlet and
triplet states usually split signiﬁcantly, for example by several thousand cm−1 [78,79]. It is remarked that the amount of splitting
between the lowest singlet and triplet state strongly depends on the
states’ orbital parentage. For states of MLCT character, for example,
E(S1 − T1 ) is signiﬁcantly smaller (several 103 cm−1 [78]) than for
states which are mainly localized at the ligands, i.e. ligand centered
(LC) ␲␲* states (order of 104 cm−1 [30,78]). This is a consequence
of the fact that in the former case, the interactions between the
unpaired electrons are smaller due to the larger spatial separation
of the involved orbitals. Further, if SOC is taken into account, the
triplet state splits into three substates. The corresponding zeroﬁeld splittings (ZFS) lie in the range of less than 1 cm−1 up to more
than 200 cm−1 , depending on the strength of SOC according to the
position of the central metal in the periodic table and on the extent
of spin–orbit coupling of this triplet state with higher lying 1,3 MLCT
states of different conﬁgurations (see Section 4). It is mentioned
that spin–spin interactions can be ignored in the scope of the discussion of this contribution, since they only lead to splittings of the
order of 0.1 cm−1 (compare Refs. [29,30,80–82]).
In summary, an excitation from an occupied orbital to an unoccupied orbital leads to four energy states. Consequently, excitations
involving all MOs shown in Fig. 3 (18 excitations without including the d* orbitals) give 72 energy states. A quantitative description
taking conﬁguration interaction (CI) and spin–orbit coupling (SOC)
into account will lead to signiﬁcant energy shifts and modiﬁcations of the electronic states. Thus, it becomes clear that a simple
HOMO–LUMO consideration can be very misleading.
For completeness, it is remarked that according to a quantum
mechanical investigation of Ir(ppy)3 by Nozaki [83], even the 72
states of our model would not be sufﬁcient to approach the experimental situation. Only an inclusion of about 200 states, meaning
32 additional excitations between MOs, might result in a somewhat
more realistic description. Interestingly, about 70 states lie within

H. Yersin et al. / Coordination Chemistry Reviews 255 (2011) 2622–2652

an energy range of about 8000 cm−1 (≈1 eV) above the emitting
state [83], exemplifying the high density of energy states and the
complexity of a reliable calculation (compare also Refs. [84,85]).
Nevertheless, relatively simple guidelines for the evaluation of
the dominating SOC routes (Section 4 and [79,86,87]) and an experimentally based systematics (Section 6) allow us to develop a deeper
understanding of how spin-orbit coupling, zero-ﬁeld splitting, and
emission decay times are related.
4. Spin–orbit coupling in organo-transition metal
compounds
In this section, we want to take a closer look at spin–orbit coupling and its impact on the properties of the emitting triplet state. It
is not intended to provide detailed theoretical formalisms, but we
want to present some general schemes and useful trends which
are understandable also for non-specialists. Thus, no numerical
data will be given and descriptions based on quantum mechanical
relations will be restricted to some basic considerations.
4.1. Orbitals and states
An introduction to the frontier orbitals of organo-transition
metal compounds and the resulting singlet and triplet states is
already given in Section 3. However, in the scope of discussions
of spin–orbit coupling, we will restrict our model to a simple 4orbital-model that involves two occupied d-orbitals d1 and d2
centered at the metal ion and one occupied and one unoccupied
␲- and ␲*-orbital, respectively, which are centered at a ligand.
In this model, the four orbitals are occupied by six electrons.
Thus, the ground state is given by a closed-shell d1 2 d2 2 ␲2 electron conﬁguration and represents a singlet. Promotion of a single
electron with or without a spin-ﬂip can lead to six different states
(terms), which are depicted in Fig. 4. The upper left index corresponds to the spin multiplicity (2S+1) which is three for a triplet
with a total spin quantum number of S = 1 and one for a singlet
with S = 0. The spins of the unpaired electrons add up to the magnetic spin quantum number MS . In the case of single excitations,
two unpaired electrons result and the possible values of MS are +1,
0, and −1. The values of MS = ±1 correspond to two substates of a
triplet. The third triplet substate is given by a positive linear combination of the two possible conﬁgurations with MS = 0. On the other
hand, the respective negative linear combination describes the corresponding singlet state. For clarity, we drop the index MS = 0 for
singlet states from now on.
As already mentioned in Section 3, the simple schemes depicted
in Figs. 3 and 4 do not include the exchange interaction, which can
– depending on the orbital nature of the respective states – lead to
an energy splitting of several thousand cm−1 between the singlet
and the corresponding triplet state. Further, note that all visualized
states in Fig. 4 are pure states with respect to their spin and their
orbital nature, i.e. no mixing between states of different and also of
the same spin multiplicity is yet taken into account.

selection rule MS = 0, ±1, according to the Slater–Condon rules
for matrix elements of such operators [88]. Further, even if these
conditions are fulﬁlled, many of the possible coupling routes contribute only little with respect to a few dominating routes and thus
can be neglected [79,86,87].
Let us, for example, focus on the MS = +1 substate of the 3 (d1 ␲*)
state, i.e. the 3 (d1 ␲*)+1 substate.2 Spin–orbit coupling between
this substate and the singlet and triplet ␲␲*-states (1,3 LC states)
depicted in Fig. 4 is weak, since the d1 - and the ␲- or ␲*-orbitals are
located at different atomic centers. According to quantum mechanics, the resulting matrix elements can be described as two- or
three-center integrals, which are – due to the exponential decay of
each orbital with increasing distance from its center – vanishingly
small and thus can be neglected. Moreover, the 3 (d1 ␲*)+1 substate can formally also couple with the singlet MLCT state resulting
from the same d-orbital, i.e. with 1 (d1 ␲*). In this case, a one-center
integral on the metal, which has a large coupling constant, would
result. However, the SOC operator cannot couple the d1 -orbital
with itself (for details, see e.g. Refs. [87,88]). As a consequence,
SOC between a 3 MLCT1 substate and the 1 MLCT1 state stemming
from the same d-orbital can be neglected [79,83,86,87,89,90]. On
the other hand, strong spin–orbit interaction can result by the coupling of 3 (d1 ␲*)+1 with the singlet and triplet MLCT2 (sub)states
involving the different orbital d2 , namely with 1 (d2 ␲*), 3 (d2 ␲*)0 and
3 (d ␲*) .3 In these cases, two different central metal d-orbitals
2
+1
are coupled by the SOC operator at the central metal ion, thus only
one-center integrals at the metal center with a large SOC constant
result.
The impact of these effective spin–orbit coupling paths on the
photophysical properties of the 3 (d1 ␲*)+1 substate can be illustrated by using perturbation theory. For the sake of simplicity, we
will constrain the present consideration on SOC of 3 (d1 ␲*)+1 with
the 1 (d2 ␲*) state. The couplings with the MS = 0, +1 substates of
3 (d ␲*) can be treated equivalently. The SOC perturbed substate

E[3 (d1 * )] and E[1 (d2 ␲ * )] are the energies of the unperturbed
states. Since all three substates of 3 (d1 ␲*) have the same unperturbed energy, the index MS = +1 can be dropped in the energy
denominator in Eq. (6). Thereby, the singlet–triplet splitting, as
induced by exchange interaction (Section 3) is considered as being
already taken into account.
The effects of SOC on the energy stabilization of the 3 (d1 ␲*)+1
substate can also be described by perturbation theory. The corrected (perturbed) energy of 3 (d1 ␲*)+1 is given by [87].

Eq. (7) describes the SOC induced energy stabilization of one

The other two substates of the same triplet term can also couple
via SOC with this singlet state, if no other symmetry restrictions
exist. The corresponding SOC matrix elements are usually of different magnitude, and thus, different energy stabilizations result.

4.2. Direct spin–orbit coupling between MLCT states
At ﬁrst, we assume that the 3 MLCT state 3 (d1 ␲*) represents the
triplet state of lowest energy. Formally, the substates of this triplet
can undergo spin–orbit coupling with all other (sub)states depicted
in Fig. 4. However, since the spin–orbit coupling Hamiltonian is
a sum of one-particle operators, only (sub)states can be coupled
by SOC which differ in just one spin–orbital1 and which obey the

The other substates can be treated equivalently.
Coupling with the MS = −1 substate is not possible, since the selection rule
MS = 0, ±1 is not fulﬁlled.

Fig. 4. Orbital occupations and electronic states in a system consisting of four orbitals. Only single excitations are taken into account, thus singlet and triplet states result
(compare [86,87]).

As a consequence, a SOC induced zero-ﬁeld splitting is obtained
already by interaction with only one singlet state. Moreover, taking
the coupling with the MS = 0, +1 substates of 3 (d2 ␲*) into account as
mentioned above, further terms have to be added on the right hand
side of Eq. (5), involving other mixing coefﬁcients of the type of Eq.
(6). Accordingly, additional contributions to the energy stabilization become effective and a different ZFS results (see, for example,
Eq. (12)).
Without SOC interaction, 3 (d1 ␲*)+1 is a pure triplet substate and
the corresponding radiative transition to the singlet ground state is
strictly spin-forbidden. However, with SOC a distinct allowedness
of this transition can result. For the case of coupling with only the
1 (d ␲*) state, as mentioned above, the radiative rate constant kr for

the perturbed substate may be expressed as [29,87].

between the electronic singlet ground state S0 and the 1 (d2 ␲*)
state. Thus, the radiative rate depends on the allowedness of
this singlet–singlet transition, i.e. on its oscillator strength. It
is stressed again that the other substates of the 3 (d1 ␲*) state
experience different admixtures due to different mixing coefﬁcients in analogy to Eq. (6) and thus, will show different radiative
rates.

4.3. Indirect spin–orbit coupling to LC states
Now we assume that the lowest triplet state is the ligand centered state 3 (␲␲*) and we will illustrate coupling routes for its
MS = +1 substate. When considering spin–orbit coupling of this
substate with any other electronic (sub)state depicted in Fig. 4,
it can be derived that only matrix elements representing twoor three-center integrals occur [86,87]. Thus, direct SOC between
the 3 (␲␲*)+1 substate and higher lying states is negligible. However, even for transition metal compounds with ligand centered T1
states, larger zero-ﬁeld splittings and much higher radiative rates
than typically found for organic molecules are frequently observed.
Similarly as argued above, Azumi, Miki, Crosby, and co-workers
[91] have shown that these observations cannot be rationalized
by direct SOC between the 3 LC substates and higher lying 1 MLCT

states.4 Instead, a two-step mechanism was suggested. It consists
of conﬁgurational mixing (conﬁguration interaction, CI) of the 3 LC
substates with 3 MLCT substates and subsequent direct SOC of the
latter ones with 1 MLCT states5 [82,91,92]. A similar approach published by Giesbergen and Glasbeek makes use of molecular orbital
theory, assuming signiﬁcant mixing of metal d-orbitals with ligand
␲-orbitals [93].
In the following description, we consider again a very simpliﬁed 3-state model, involving the purely ligand centered T1 substate
3 (␲␲*) , the triplet MLCT substate 3 (d ␲*) , and the singlet
+1

MLCT2 state 1 (d2 ␲*). 3 (␲␲*)+1 can mix via conﬁguration interaction with the 3 (d1 ␲*)+1 substate, since the CI selection rules S = 0
and MS = 0 are fulﬁlled. Treating CI as the only perturbation, the
3 LC substate can be expressed as [81,82,91]

HCI is the conﬁguration interaction Hamiltonian. A large mixing
coefﬁcient b leads to a signiﬁcant 3 MLCT perturbation of the 3 LC
substate. It is stressed that CI acts equally also for the two other
triplet substates. This means that CI as the only perturbation does
not lead to different energy stabilizations of the substates and thus,
no zero-ﬁeld splitting occurs. However, the admixed 3 (d1 ␲*)+1 substate can in turn, as expressed by Eq. (5), contain admixtures of the
1 (d ␲*) state via SOC, as discussed in Section 4.2. Thus, one has
2
to deal with a combination of both conﬁguration interaction and
spin–orbit coupling as perturbation. This leads to an expression for
the doubly perturbed 3 LC substate

with the mixing coefﬁcient b as given in Eq. (10), while c represents
a coefﬁcient that can be expressed by different matrix elements and
energy denominators (compare [87]). Even for this relatively simple
model, a perturbational approach for the description of the energy
stabilization of the 3 (␲␲*)+1 substate and the radiative rate with
respect to its transition to the singlet ground state becomes rather
complicated. However, even without giving explicit equations, it
should become obvious that, due to the involvement of different
matrix elements, i.e. for CI and for SOC, and different energy denominators, this indirect SOC path to the substates of a 3 LC state has less
inﬂuence on the ZFS and the radiative decay rates than direct SOC
to the substates of a 3 MLCT.
4.4. Treatments in realistic systems
The simple model dealing just with states created from four
frontier orbitals, as presented above, does not hold for a more realistic treatment of spin–orbit coupling in organo-transition metal

It is remarked that frequently direct SOC between 3 LC and 1 MLCT states is erroneously assumed.

Conﬁguration interaction (CI) is based on electron–electron interaction. Thus,

compounds, since there is a large number of higher lying singlet and
triplet states which also have to be taken into account (see Section
3). Many of these states can signiﬁcantly contribute to the emitting
triplet substates via direct or indirect SOC, if the selection rules
for SOC are fulﬁlled, if the resulting matrix elements correspond to
one-center integrals at the central metal ion, and if no symmetry
restrictions are effective. For the leading admixtures to substate i
of a T1 state of MLCT character, this is schematically depicted in
Fig. 5. The parameters ˛, ˇ, , etc. represent the respective mixing coefﬁcients. As described above, the mixing of 3 MLCT1 (i) with
the singlet MLCT1 state stemming from the same d-orbital can be
neglected. Moreover, any mixing with singlet or triplet LC states is
also negligible.
In such a somewhat more realistic treatment of SOC, the energies and radiative rates can, at least in principle, be expressed by
Eqs. (12) and (13), as given below. Here, we apply the nomenclature which is also used for the case studies presented later in this
contribution. This means that the lowest triplet term consists of the
substates I, II, and III. If only direct SOC is considered, the energy

E[Sm ] and E[Tn ] are the unperturbed energies of higher lying (pure)
singlet states Sm and (pure) triplet states Tn . Tn (j) characterizes
a substate j of Tn . Eqs. (12) and (13) are the generalizations of
Eqs. (7) and (8), respectively. SOC with the most proximate 3 MLCT
state(s) of a different orbital nature presumably dominates the
individual energy stabilizations of the T1 substates and thus the
amount of zero-ﬁeld splitting. This is simply a consequence of
the smaller energy denominators (E[T1 ] − E [Tn ]) as compared to
(E [T1 ] − E [Sm ]). On the other hand, an admixture of triplets can
be neglected for the determination of the radiative rates, since the
corresponding dipole matrix elements vanish.
The situation is different, if the lowest triplet state represents
a 3 LC state. As outlined in Section 4.3, SOC becomes effective
indirectly via conﬁguration interaction. Thus, Eqs. (12) and (13)
have to be modiﬁed. This leads to complicated formulas, since a
huge manifold of possible paths of CIs and SOCs to higher lying
states/substates has to be considered. This situation is illustrated
schematically in Fig. 6. The relevant coupling paths of a substate of
3 LC character to two singlet MLCT states and to substates of two
triplet MLCT states are depicted. According to the considerations of
the previous sections, even in this simpliﬁed scheme two coupling
paths of CI and three paths of SOC are included. The parameters ˛,
ˇ, , ı, and ε in Fig. 6 represent mixing coefﬁcients and display the
contributions of the respective (sub)states in the emitting substate
T1 (i).

4.5. Spin–orbit coupling and coordination geometry
The relations derived in the previous sections demonstrate that,
for both direct and indirect coupling paths, large SOC matrix elements are necessary to obtain signiﬁcant zero-ﬁeld splitting and
radiative rates. Moreover, it was shown that also energy denominators, i.e. the energy differences between the unperturbed substate
and the perturbing states, play an important role. In particular, the
larger the energy separation between two states, the smaller is their
mixing via SOC or CI.
Already these simple considerations allow us to work out very
useful guidelines for the effectiveness of SOCs and their impact on
emission properties. This becomes clear, if one takes into account
that these energy separations depend signiﬁcantly on the geometry of a compound, the number of ligands coordinating to the
central metal ion, and the ligand ﬁeld splitting [95,96]. If, in a
ﬁrst order approximation, one assumes that for the different MLCT
states, e.g. d1 ␲*, d2 ␲*, etc., the singlet–triplet splittings (given by
exchange interactions) are similar, one can consider just the separations between the orbital energies. Frequently, this concept meets
the chemical intuition [79,86,87].
Fig. 7 depicts the splitting of the central metal d-orbitals (a) for
an octahedral (Oh ) and a distorted octahedral compound and (b)
for a square-planar (D4h ) and a distorted square-planar compound.
For this model discussion, one ␲*-orbital, representing the lowest
unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), is also given. Other unoccupied ␲*-orbitals and occupied ␲-orbitals are neglected here for
clarity. Thus, all considered electronic states are MLCT states with
a central-metal d-orbital as the highest occupied molecular orbital
(HOMO).

Fig. 7. Schematic splitting of the d-orbitals (a) in an octahedral and a distorted
octahedral compound and (b) in a square-planar and a distorted square-planar compound. The frames display the different splitting of the occupied d-orbitals. In all
cases a ␲*-orbital, representing the LUMO, is displayed in addition. The unoccupied
d-orbitals are only given for completeness.
Adapted from Ref. [87].

In the case of perfect octahedral symmetry (Oh symmetry), the
d-orbitals split into sets of three t2g and two eg orbitals, separated
by 10 Dq with Dq being the ligand ﬁeld parameter [95,96]. For metal
ions with a d6 conﬁguration, such as Ir(III), Os(II), and Ru(II), the
t2g -shell is fully occupied. For compounds of relevance for OLED
applications, the unoccupied eg -orbitals have to have energies high
above the LUMO to prevent quenching by dd* states (compare Section 5.2.1). For most octahedrally coordinated complexes discussed
in this contribution (see Fig. 9), the symmetry is lower than C3 . As a
consequence, the orbitals of the t2g manifold are no longer degenerate and split into the three orbitals d1 , d2 , and d3 , according to
the respective geometrical distortion. However, they will still be
rather proximate in energy. For [Ru(bpy)3 ]2+ (38), for example, a t2g
splitting of only a few hundred wavenumbers is reported [97–99].
According to the relations derived above, the substates of the lowest
3 MLCT state 3 (d ␲*) can experience efﬁcient SOC with the rela1
tively close-lying singlet states 1 (d2 ␲*) and 1 (d3 ␲*) and the substates of the corresponding triplets 3 (d2 ␲*) and 3 (d3 ␲*), since the
energy denominators are relatively small. As a consequence, large
zero-ﬁeld splittings and relatively high radiative rates can occur for
the transitions between the 3 (d1 ␲*) substates and the ground state.
For quasi-square-planar compounds a different situation is
found. For central metal ions exhibiting a d8 electron conﬁguration, such as Ir(I), Pt(II), and Pd(II), the four lower lying d-orbitals
are occupied. The ordering of these orbitals depends strongly on
the nature and the bonding abilities of the coordinating ligands
[95,96,100]. The depicted order, as shown in Fig. 7, is obtained from
ligand ﬁeld theory without considering additional (back)bonding
effects. The splitting between the occupied orbitals is larger than
for quasi-octahedrally coordinated compounds. Again, the unoccupied antibonding dx2 −y2 orbital is strongly destabilized and shifted
to high energy for strong-ﬁeld ligands. In analogy to the situation described above, the substates of the lowest 3 MLCT state
3 (d ␲*) can exhibit SOC with the singlet states 1 (d ␲*), 1 (d ␲*) and
1
2
3
1 (d ␲*), as well as with the substates of the corresponding triplets
4
3 (d ␲*), 3 (d ␲*), and 3 (d ␲*). However, in this case, the energy
2
3
4
differences between d1 and the other occupied d-orbitals d2 , d3 ,
and d4 are, for most compounds, distinctly larger than for quasioctahedrally coordinated compounds (Fig. 7). For [Pt(CN)4 ]2− , for
example, the energy difference between the highest occupied dorbitals (HOMO and HOMO−1) is as high as about 4000 cm−1
(0.5 eV) [100]. Consequently, the energy denominators which govern the mixing between the MLCT states are signiﬁcantly larger in
this case than for quasi-octahedral coordination. Thus, for quasisquare-planar compounds the efﬁciency of SOC will not attain the
one of quasi-octahedral compounds. (compare also [101]).
For the sake of clarity, the presented discussion was focused on
emitting states of MLCT character, neglecting 3 LC states. However,
the described inﬂuence of a compound’s coordination geometry on
its SOC induced photophysical properties is also valid for emitting
states that are largely of ligand centered character. In this case,
the 3 LC substates gain singlet character only via the proposed twostep mechanism. Accordingly, the relative energy differences of the
lowest triplet LC state to higher lying triplets of MLCT character
have to be taken into account, which, in ﬁrst order, are governed

Of course, the presented model based on simple considerations
of ligand ﬁeld splittings can be regarded as being oversimpliﬁed for a quantitative description of realistic systems. However,
a comparison of photophysical properties of quasi-square-planar
with quasi-octahedral transition metal compounds with “similar”
central metal ions and identical ligands reﬂects the trends and predictions given above. For instance, Table 1 lists four such pairs of
Ir(III) and Pt(II) complexes. Both central metal ions have comparable spin–orbit coupling constants. Pt(II) complexes exhibit a d8
electron conﬁguration and form quasi-square-planar compounds,
while Ir(III) compounds with a d6 conﬁguration are usually quasioctahedrally coordinated.
Table 1 compares the total zero-ﬁeld splittings E(ZFS) and
(averaged) radiative decay rates at ambient temperature for a series
of Pt(N∧ C)(acac) and Ir(N∧ C)2 (acac) couples. (N∧ C is an anionic
cyclometallating ligand and acac is acetylacetonate. Chemical
structures are shown in Fig. 9.) The respective emission maximum
at 300 K is also given.
It can clearly be seen that for all couples listed the total zeroﬁeld splitting of the emitting triplet state and the radiative rate are
signiﬁcantly larger for the Ir(III) than for the respective Pt(II) compounds. In Section 6, we will come back to this important trend
which relates the amount of zero-ﬁeld splitting to the character
of the emitting state and to the spin–orbit coupling efﬁciency. The
higher this splitting, the larger is the MLCT character of the T1 state
and the more efﬁcient is SOC. This leads to higher radiative rates
for the transitions from the T1 substates to the ground state S0 .
In summary, all listed quasi-octahedral Ir(N∧ C)2 (acac) compounds
exhibit more efﬁcient SOC than the related quasi-square-planar
Pt(N∧ C)(acac) compounds. This observation is in agreement with
the simple model presented above.
5. Nonradiative processes
In the previous section, it was derived that organo-transition
metal compounds can exhibit relatively high radiative rates for the
transitions from the T1 substates to the singlet ground state. However, this is not sufﬁcient to obtain high emission quantum yields.
According to Eq. (3), it is of crucial importance to minimize also
the rate constants of nonradiative deactivation processes of the T1
state. The signiﬁcance of quenching processes for the electroluminescence performance has already been mentioned in Section
2. In this section, we want to summarize processes which can
induce nonradiative decay and thus can strongly reduce the photoluminescence quantum yield PL of an organo-transition metal
compound.

5.1. Intermolecular quenching
For intermolecular quenching of the emission, at least one
other molecule of the same or of a different species is necessary. If molecules of the same species are involved, luminescence
quenching preferably occurs at higher dopant concentrations
via annihilation of excited emitters in close proximity (e.g.
triplet–triplet-annihilation [67,68,70,114]) or via energy transfer according to the Förster and/or the Dexter mechanism [30]
from excited to non-excited molecules. Another process of selfquenching is frequently found for Pt(II) compounds, since their
square-planar coordination geometry facilitates axial intermolecular interactions [115–117]. Self-quenching and annihilation effects
can usually be avoided by using low dopant concentrations or by
effectively shielding the emitter molecules. This can, for example, be reached by using bulky [118,119] or dendrimeric ligands
[120–122].
Energy transfer to impurities can also result in very efﬁcient
quenching. In the scope of this contribution, we only want to
mention quenching induced by molecular oxygen. For photoluminescent materials with relatively long emission decay times, as
compared to ﬂuorescent emitters, this quenching process is frequently very effective. The corresponding mechanism is usually
described as energy transfer from an excited emitter to triplet
oxygen (3 O2 ) with subsequent conversion to the excited singlet
oxygen (1 O2 ) [123–125]. However, also electron transfer processes
are not negligible, as has been suggested for some Ir(III) compounds
which exhibit extremely high oxygen quenching rates [126]. To
avoid quenching by O2 , ﬂuid solutions of the materials have to
be carefully and quantitatively deaerated. It should be noted that
molecular oxygen diffuses also through many polymeric matrices
[127,128]. Thus, also ﬁlms doped with triplet emitters should be
handled in an inert atmosphere. The tendency to undergo oxygen
quenching is usually, but not in all cases, correlated with a long
emission decay time of an emitter. As a consequence, also in this
respect short radiative emission decay times are favorable. For oxygen sensor applications, on the other hand, long emission decay
times and high quenching constants are desired to obtain a high
sensitivity [128–130].
In ﬂuid solutions, the solvent can also efﬁciently quench the
emission of an organo-transition metal compound by forming exciplexes of an excited emitter and a solvent molecule [131–133].
Exciplex quenching is especially efﬁcient between electrophilic
emitters and strongly nucleophilic solvents. Recently, an extremely
electrophilic Pt(II) compound was reported, of which the emission
is strongly quenched even by poor Lewis bases. In the non-polar
cyclohexane, on the other hand, a high emission quantum yield
was obtained [134].

5.2. Intramolecular quenching
In contrast to intermolecular quenching shortly addressed
above, intramolecular emission quenching is an intrinsic property
of a molecule in an inert matrix. For organo-transition metal compounds, intrinsic nonradiative decay is frequently ascribed to two
mechanisms, which are shortly summarized below.
5.2.1. Thermal population of metal-centered states
A number of transition metal compounds shows a phosphorescence of high quantum yield at 77 K, but at ambient temperature
this emission is strongly or even totally quenched. In many cases,
this phenomenon can be ascribed to the thermal population of
metal-centered states of dd* character, so-called ligand-ﬁeld (LF)
states [38,135–139]. These have strongly distorted excited state
geometries with respect to the geometry of the ground state. This
leads to high nonradiative decay rates [79,140]. Recent quantum
mechanical calculations performed on Ir(III) compounds relate this
distortion to signiﬁcant elongations of metal–ligand bond lengths
[141] or even to the breaking of bonds and the formation of a trigonal bipyramidal species [38,142]. This quenching is particularly
restricting for the development of blue light emitting materials
with ortho-metallating ligands. An example, given by the couple of
Pt(ppy)(acac) (18) and Pt(4,6-dFppy)(acac) (15), will illustrate this
problem. While the ﬁrst compound is a green light emitter with
PL = 20% [143], the second one exhibits a sky-blue emission with
a PL value of only 2% [87,106], both measured in deaerated ﬂuid
solutions at ambient temperature. For both compounds, it may be
assumed that the ligand ﬁeld dd* states lie at approximately the
same energy. However, the activation energy for the population of
these states from the emitting triplet state is signiﬁcantly smaller
for the blue light emitter. Consequently, efﬁcient emission quenching can occur via this mechanism. A corresponding behavior is also
observed for the blue light emitting Ir(biqa)3 complex (41), as is
shortly addressed below (see Table 3).
Strategies to avoid the thermal population of the ligand-ﬁeld
states by “pushing” them to higher energies and making them
thermally inaccessible at ambient temperature apply, for example, chromophoric ligands with very high ligand ﬁeld strengths,
such as carbenes [144–146]. Further, it has been reported that also
in Pt(II) compounds with terdentate dipyridylbenzene N∧ C∧ N ligands, the dd* states are shifted to higher energies when compared
to compounds with bidentate phenylpyridine-based N∧ C ligands.
This is ascribed to the shorter Pt–C bond lengths in the terdentate
complexes [147–149]. Another possibility to shift these quenching
states out of reach at ambient temperature is given by the use of
strong-ﬁeld ancillary ligands such as CO and CN− [150–152]. With
these strategies, however, the occupied d-orbitals are usually also
stabilized. As a consequence, the emitting state can change its character from a 3 MLCT to a 3 LC type. This would be disadvantageous,
since the SOC efﬁciency and thus the radiative decay rates would
strongly decrease. (For further discussions of these implications see
also Section 6.)
Interestingly, thermal population of the ligand-ﬁeld dd* states
can also be inﬂuenced by the host environment. In contrast to ﬂuid
solutions, geometrical distortions of a compound’s geometry are
often largely suppressed in rigid host matrices. As a consequence,
quenching dd* states are shifted to higher energies and their population at ambient temperature is reduced. The very low emission
quantum yield of Pt(4,6-dFppy)(acac) (15) of PL = 2% in ﬂuid solution, for example, increases strongly to PL = 50% when the material
is doped into a PMMA host [87]. Similarly, Ru(II) polypyridine complexes incorporated into rigid host media like zeolites [153], oxalate
networks [154], glasses [155], and polymeric matrices [156] were
reported to exhibit distinctly higher emission quantum yields than
in ﬂuid solutions.

For completeness, it is mentioned that these problems concerning the generation of blue light emission might presumably
be avoided by using materials with fully occupied d-orbitals, e.g.
Cu(I)-compounds (compare Section 9 and Refs. [43–46]).
5.2.2. Quenching of the excited state by vibrational coupling to
the ground state
Radiationless processes from an electronically excited state
to the singlet ground state S0 can be effective via an involvement of vibrational modes of the ground state. This phenomenon
is often termed vibrational quenching. For a theoretical description, detailed formalisms based on Fermi’s golden rule have been
derived already more than four decades ago [157–160]. In the low
temperature limit of weak electronic coupling and large energy
gaps between the involved electronic states, an expression can be
derived that allows to describe the radiationless rate knr in dependence of an electronic coupling factor ˇ, factors that are determined
by the vibrational overlap of the involved wavefunctions, and
solvent effects. In particular, the famous energy gap law, predicting an exponential increase of knr with decreasing energy gap
between the excited state and the ground state, results from this
theory. The validity of the energy gap law was experimentally veriﬁed for ﬂuorescent organic molecules [161–163], polymers [164],
and also for phosphorescent organo-transition metal compounds
[165–169]. Quenching can occur, when the involved electronic
states are coupled by promoting vibrational modes and when subsequent vibrational relaxation takes place via so-called accepting
vibrational modes of the electronic ground state. Accordingly, the
nonradiative rate for vibrational quenching knr can be expressed as
[165,166,169,170]

The ﬁrst term of Eq. (14) represents the electronic coupling
between the involved electronic states (see below), while the other
terms result from the vibrational overlap factor of the initial vibrational mode of the excited state with the vibrational accepting
mode m of the ground state being in resonance. ωm = 2 m is
the angular frequency of the accepting mode m and Sm is the
Huang–Rhys parameter. E0 is the transition energy from the excited
electronic (sub)state to the ground state. The Huang–Rhys parameter Sm describes the displacement of the potential energy surfaces
of the involved electronic states along the vibrational normal coordinate of the accepting mode m. Within the described framework,
the last term treats low-energy intramolecular vibrations and solvent effects classically by describing these interactions collectively
by the half-width of the emission bands ¯ 1/2 . a is a constant in
units of (cm−1 )−2 [166,170]. To ﬁrst order, Eq. (14) can be simpliﬁed, if compounds with similar electronic couplings (represented
by ˇ, see below) and similar interactions with the solvent (represented by ¯ 1/2 ) are compared. Thus, one obtains a more common
form of the energy gap law, given by
knr ∝ const · exp −

E0
h
¯ ωm

(16)

From Eq. (16) it can be seen that the nonradiative rate decreases
with increasing electronic transition energy E0 , with decreasing
angular frequency ωm of the accepting vibrational mode, and with
decreasing Huang–Rhys parameter Sm , since the latter essentially

H. Yersin et al. / Coordination Chemistry Reviews 255 (2011) 2622–2652

determines the parameter . Thus, especially red emitting compounds with emitting states that are geometrically distorted with
respect to the ground state are very sensitive to emission quenching via this mechanism. For blue and green emitting compounds,
vibrational quenching is usually weak, as was shown, for example,
by an extrapolation of the nonradiative rate to the blue spectral
range according to the energy gap law [38].
Further, strategies of enhancing the molecular rigidity to reduce
the Huang–Rhys parameters corresponding to the accepting vibrational modes were also successful with regard to a decrease
of the nonradiative rate. This can, for example, be done by
using compounds with tridentate N∧ C∧ N- [147–149] or tetradentate C∧ N∧ N∧ C-coordinating ligands [171] instead of bidentate
N∧ C-ligands. Examples of the latter approach are also given
by Pt(ppy2 -tBua) (21), Pt(tBu2 -ppy2 -ﬂuoren) (30), and Pt(ppy2 ﬂuoren) (35), respectively (compare Fig. 9 and Table 2).
The parameter ˇ represents the vibronic coupling between the
involved electronic states. In our case, we focus on an emitting
triplet state, or more exactly on an individual substate of T1 , and
on the electronic ground state S0 . According to Refs. [160,165], ˇ
is essentially determined by a small number of promoting vibrational modes. The contribution of one speciﬁc promoting mode k is
determined by an expression of the form

where Mk is the reduced mass of the speciﬁc mode k. This vibrational mode promotes (induces) the coupling between the two
states involved (see below). Qk is the respective normal mode coordinate. S and T are the electronic wavefunctions of the ground
state S0 and of a substate of the excited triplet state T1 , respectively. Note that these wavefunctions depend parametrically on
the nuclear geometry, i.e. on the normal coordinates Qk . In this
approach, T represents a perturbed wavefunction of one triplet
substate. That means the wavefunction is already modiﬁed by SOC
and contains admixtures from higher lying singlet states. (The
structure of corresponding functions is presented in Section 4 in
Eqs. (5), (9), and (11)). Further, to a very good approximation,
the unperturbed wavefunction of the singlet ground state may be
applied for S .
The message of Eq. (18) can be illustrated by referring to experimental results. For example, it is obvious, that the matrix element
in Eq. (18) vanishes for a pure triplet state or becomes small for
triplet states with only very small singlet admixtures. Indeed, the
investigations carried out for Ir(ppy)3 (52) show that the nonradiative rates are distinctly different for the three triplet substates (see
Tables 3 and 5). Substate I exhibits only a very small singlet admixture, it represents an almost pure triplet state [40,79,83]. In fact, the
nonradiative rate of the transition to the ground state amounts to
only ≈8 × 102 s−1 . On the other hand, the substates II and III experience signiﬁcant SOC and thus, the wavefunctions have distinct
singlet admixtures [40,79,83]. Accordingly, the nonradiative rates
of these substates are higher by one and more than two orders of
magnitude, respectively (see Table 5). Although the leading promoting mode is not known, it is evident that SOC is important for
the nonradiative decay, since all other terms in Eq. (14) are supposed not to vary for the three triplet substates of Ir(ppy)3 . For

2633

completeness, it is remarked that, with increasing singlet admixtures to the triplet substates of Ir(ppy)3 , an even larger increase of
the radiative rates is observed. This leads to almost 100% emission
quantum yield at ambient temperature (compare Section 8).
A similar behavior is also obvious for the two couples
Ir(thpy)2 (acac) (33)/Pt(thpy)(acac) (12) and Ir(s1-thpy)2 (acac)
(20)/Pt(s1-thpy)(acac) (6) [107] as presented already in Table 1. In
both cases, SOC with respect to the emitting states is more efﬁcient
for the Ir(III) than for the Pt(II) compounds. This results in higher
radiative rates for the Ir(III) complexes. Moreover, being in line with
the discussion of the present section, also the nonradiative rates are
larger in the case of more efﬁcient SOC. In particular, for the two
couples mentioned, the knr values are by more than a factor of two
larger for the triplet–singlet transitions of the Ir(III) than of the Pt(II)
complexes [107]. As another example it is referred to Ir(biqa)3 (41)
(Table 3). However, this blue light emitter experiences an additional
quenching in ﬂuid solution at ambient temperature. Presumably
this effect can be explained by thermal population of a relatively
close-lying ligand ﬁeld dd* state, being separated by ≈2350 cm−1
from the emitting triplet state [172].
Furthermore, also the derivative ∂␾T /∂Qk in Eq. (18) can be
illustrated by a qualitative model. An interaction between the
wavefunctions S and T can be promoted by a selective vibrational
mode k, if the wavefunction T changes along the corresponding vibrational coordinate Qk . For example, in Section 8.5 it will
be shown that the environment of an emitter (matrix cage) can
alter d- and ␲-orbital mixing by variations of the cage geometry. These effects can distinctly alter SOC efﬁciencies. It is likely
that corresponding effects will also occur with speciﬁc vibrations,
which modify the molecular geometry of a complex. Obviously,
such effects are not only restricted to low-energy complex-cage
modes, but can also be induced (promoted) by other vibrations.
Accordingly, the derivative ∂␾T /∂Qk and the matrix element in Eq.
(18) seem to be of high importance.

6. Emission decay times, radiative rates, and zero-ﬁeld
splitting – A systematic approach
The radiative rate of a transition from a triplet state or from one
of its substates to the electronic ground state is of crucial importance for many photo-physical properties and most applications
that make use of light emission. Thus, a deeper understanding of
the factors which control this rate is of extraordinary importance.
As described in Section 4, only spin–orbit coupling (SOC) opens a
radiative path from a triplet state, or more exactly from its substates, to the singlet ground state. In Eq. (13) it is displayed that
the interaction of a triplet substate i (i = I, II, and III) with higher
lying singlet states via SOC essentially determines the radiative rate
kr (i). These effects of SOC between the states are expressed by the
SOC matrix elements and energy denominators. On the other hand,
similar and even the same matrix elements are responsible for the
energy shifts of the individual triplet substates. The corresponding expression is displayed in Eq. (12). Mostly, each triplet substate
experiences a speciﬁc SOC-induced energy stabilization. The resulting (small) energy differences between these relatively large shifts
give the zero-ﬁeld splitting parameters EI,II and EI,III = E(ZFS),
respectively.
Since both photo-physical effects, the ZFS of the T1 state and
the radiative allowedness of the transitions from its substates to
the singlet ground state, are traced back to the same type of matrix
elements, as displayed in Eqs. (12) and (13), it should be possible
to relate both expressions. An analytical approach does not seem
to be easily achievable and has not yet been carried out. However,
if the averaged ambient temperature decay times av (300 K) (and
for four compounds also the corresponding radiative decay times)

substates ( I , II , and III ) and the zero-ﬁeld splitting values ( EI,II
and EI,III ). These data are summarized in Table 2. This procedure
has the advantage that the individual decay times as determined
in our studies are largely based on emission properties at cryogenic temperatures at which radiationless deactivation is usually
less important (compare Ref. [177]) and therefore, though in a
relatively crude approximation, are better suited for the present
approach (that would require data for radiative processes) than
the measured decay times at ambient temperature. In several
cases, the emission at ambient temperature is even quenched
totally and thus the respective data points would not be available at all. To summarize, the emission properties of the three
substates of the emitting triplet can be studied successfully at
cryogenic temperatures and by use of Eq. (20) the decay time
av (300 K) becomes available.
The relation depicted in Fig. 8 shows a series of interesting
trends:
Fig. 8. Emission decay time av (300 K) versus the total zero-ﬁeld splitting E(ZFS).
The data points, taken from Table 2, are connected by an eye-guiding curve. av
(300 K) represents the averaged emission decay time of the three triplet substates
at ambient temperature. (For further details see text.) The different symbols (squares
and rhombs) label the complex geometries (square-planar and octahedral, respectively). For four compounds (open symbols), the purely radiative decay times have
been determined (compare Table 3). The bar in the lower part of the diagram gives a
classiﬁcation of the emitting triplet as 3 LC (3 ␲␲*), 3 LC/3 MLCT (3 LC with signiﬁcant
3
MLCT admixtures), and 3 MLCT (3 d␲*), respectively. Compounds with 3 LC/3 MLCT or
3
MLCT character are potentially suited for OLED-applications. The chemical structures of the compounds are shown in Fig. 9.

are plotted versus E(ZFS) as depicted in Fig. 8, it is seen that a
functional description of the form
av (300 K)

= f ( E(ZFS))

(19)

exists. av (300 K) is given by the Boltzmann-weighted average
of the individual decay times of the three triplet substates
at 300 K. A justiﬁcation for this approach is given below.
The dashed curve shown in Fig. 8 represents simply an eyeguiding function. Empirically, this curve may be described by
−1 + 0.75 ␮s with a = 70 ␮s cm−1 and
av (300 K) = a( E(ZFS) + b)
b = 0.02 cm−1 . av (300 K) and E(ZFS) are measured in ␮s and
cm−1 , respectively. A qualitative interpretation is given below in
this section.
The experimental data that lead to the diagram in Fig. 8 require
some comments:
•

E(ZFS) represents the total ZFS, expressed by the energy separation EI,III between the highest and the lowest T1 substate.
These energies are obtained either from highly resolved spectra
or from an analysis of the temperature dependence of the emission decay time. In the latter case, one takes advantage of the fact
that, under the assumption of a fast thermalization, the averaged
decay time av for a system of three excited substates I, II, and III
can be written as [173–176]
av

=

1
1 + e−(
=
kav
kI + kII e−(

EI,II /kB T )
EI,II /kB T )

+ e−( EI,III /kB T )
+ kIII e−( EI,III /kB T )

(20)

where kI = 1/ I , kII = 1/ II , and kIII = 1/ III represent the individual
decay rates (or the reciprocal decay times) of the triplet substates I, II, and III, respectively. EI,II and EI,III are the energy
separations between the T1 substates.
• The decay time values to be used in this context should be the
purely radiative ones. However, this information is not available
apart from a few examples (see the open symbols in Fig. 8 and
compare Table 3). Therefore, we used the average decay time
av (300 K), which is extrapolated to ambient temperature by use
of Eq. (20) from the individual decay times of the three triplet

• The emission decay time decreases by more than three orders of
magnitude with increasing E(ZFS) (note the logarithmic scale).
This is induced by an increasing effectivity of SOC between the
emitting triplet state and higher lying singlet states (compare Eq.
(13)).
• The observed trend is valid for a large number of organotransition metal compounds even with various central metal ions,
such as Ru(II), Rh(III), Pd(II), Re(I), Os(II), Pt(II), or Ir(III).
• According to extensive investigations by Yersin’s group
[33,34,78,79,86,87,178], it is possible to characterize the emitting
triplet states on the basis of the magnitude of E(ZFS). Thus, the
compounds grouped on the left hand side of the diagram with
E(ZFS) values of less than a few wavenumbers represent states
being largely of 3 LC (3 ␲␲*) character. For these emitters, SOC is
not very effective and therefore E(ZFS) is small. The radiative
decay times can be as long as several milliseconds. According to
the spin–orbit coupling routes introduced in Section 4, this situation can be described by weak indirect spin–orbit coupling via
conﬁguration interaction (compare Section 4.3 and Fig. 6). On the
other hand, the triplet states of compounds with large zero-ﬁeld
splitting, for example being greater than 50 cm−1 , are assigned as
being mainly of 3 MLCT (3 d␲*) character. These states experience
efﬁcient direct SOC with other 1,3 MLCT states as described in
Section 4.2 (compare also Fig. 5). Thus, the radiative rates become
larger and the corresponding decay times shorter. For example,
for Ir(ppy)3 (52) in frozen CH2 Cl2 , a E(ZFS) value of 170 cm−1
and a radiative decay time of only 1.6 ␮s are determined (Section
8, Ref. [40]). Finally, the triplet states of compounds that exhibit
E(ZFS) values in the intermediate range of several cm−1 up
to several ten cm−1 may be classiﬁed as 3 LC (3 ␲␲*) states with
signiﬁcant 3 MLCT admixtures. Accordingly, the radiative decay
times are longer than for emitting 3 MLCT states and mostly lie
in the range of 5–10 ␮s (compare also Table 2).
• The differently shaded bars displayed in the lower part of Fig. 8
refer to the classiﬁcation of the emitting triplet states as discussed
above. Provided that further basic conditions, such as high PL
values, well suited redox potentials, no overall charge, good processability, etc. are fulﬁlled, compounds with emitting states of
3 LC/3 MLCT or 3 MLCT character are suited as emitters for OLED
applications.
• As discussed in Section 2, the emission decay time should be
as short as possible to reduce roll-off effects. This is especially important for lighting applications. Indeed, all OLED triplet
emitters with acceptable performance studied so far exhibit zeroﬁeld splittings of the emitting triplet term larger than about
8–10 cm−1 [79,179]. Especially, the best suited triplet emitters are Ir(III) complexes with zero-ﬁeld splittings greater than

For completeness, it is remarked that the systematics presented
in Fig. 8 is only valid for the types of organometallic compounds as
discussed in the context of this section or as summarized in Table 2.
It is not excluded that much shorter radiative decay times, being
a target for bright and efﬁcient OLED lighting, might be attainable
with other electronic structures. In this respect, we proposed to
investigate compounds with low-lying and strongly emitting singlet states and introduced the singlet harvesting effect (compare
Sections 2 and 9).
Table 2 summarizes data for a number of organo-transition
metal compounds of the second and third period of transition metals. These compounds exhibit emitting triplet states of 3 LC, 3 MLCT,
and mixed 3 LC/3 MLCT character, respectively. Most data given in
the table have been determined by cooling the samples to cryogenic temperatures, since at ambient temperature the detailed

This crude approximation allows us to describe qualitatively
the behavior shown in Fig. 8. An increase of SOC, which usually leads to a shortening of the emission decay time III , will
normally also induce an increase of the splittings between the
triplet substates. The resulting larger E(ZFS) will prevent further signiﬁcant reduction of a compound’s (radiative) emission
decay time.

about 50 cm−1 . Examples are: Ir(piq)3 (37): 64 cm−1 ; Ir(4,6dFppy)2 (pic) (36): 76 cm−1 ; Ir(dm-2-piq)2 (acac) (51): 100 cm−1 ;
Ir(ppy)3 (52): 170 cm−1 . Recently it has been shown that Pt(II)
complexes, lying in the intermediate range, also represent attractive OLED emitters [7,180–189].
• Interestingly, all compounds with E(ZFS) values greater than
about 50 cm−1 have (quasi-) octahedrally coordinated central
metal ions. In contrast, the largest E(ZFS) value observed so
far for a Pt(II) complex with a (quasi-) square-planar coordination amounts only to 46 cm−1 [143]. As described in Section 4.5,
this behavior is a consequence of relatively large energy separations between mixing MLCT states in square-planar compounds.
This leads to less effective SOCs than in compounds with octahedral coordination. A further example is also very illustrative.
The lowest triplet state of the quasi-octahedral [Ru(bpy)3 ]2+ (38)
shows a value of E(ZFS) = 61 cm−1 [190–195], which is signiﬁcantly larger than found for any Pt(II) complex, although the SOC
constant of Ru(II) is by more than a factor of 4 smaller than that
of Pt(II) [196].
• One speciﬁc trend, which is clearly displayed in Fig. 8, merits
special comments. With increasing E(ZFS) and thus increasing
impact of SOC, the emission decay time av (300 K) does not seem
to decrease to signiﬁcantly lower values than about 1 ␮s. The
plot appears to exhibit an asymptotic decrease. The reason for
this behavior is easily explained, if one takes into account that
av (300 K), approximately representing the radiative emission
decay time at ambient temperature (see above), is determined
by a Boltzmann distribution as displayed in Eq. (20). At ambient
temperature, all three triplet substates are responsible for the
emission decay time. In particular, although the highest triplet
substate III mostly exhibits by far the shortest (radiative) decay
time, at least for Ir(III) complexes with large E(ZFS) values, substate III contributes only according to its Boltzmann-governed
population (compare also Section 8.6) This can be illustrated
by a simple approximation. Let us assume that the individual
emission decay time decreases in the order III
II , I and that
EI,II
EI,III , which is frequently found for MLCT emitters with
large zero-ﬁeld splittings (e.g. compare Table 2 or Figs. 13 and 16).
Under these conditions and in a high-temperature limit, for
example at T = 300 K, Eq. (20) simpliﬁes to

Column 2 reproduces the 0–0 energy position of the lowest
triplet substate I. For many compounds given in Table 2, this transition is resolved at low temperatures, e.g. at T = 1.2 K. On the other
hand, for compounds for which such a high resolution could not be
obtained, the corresponding energy position is estimated from the
high-energy ﬂank of the low-temperature emission spectrum.
Columns 3 and 4 display the zero-ﬁeld splitting (ZFS) values
EI,II and EI,III of the lowest triplet state T1 . These data represent the energy separations between substate I and the higher
lying substates II and III, respectively. In particular, the total zeroﬁeld splitting E(ZFS) is given by EI,III . Only compounds are
summarized in Table 2 for which the corresponding information
is available. The data are determined either by direct observation of the splitting pattern or indirectly from an analysis of the
temperature-dependent emission decay time by applying Eq. (20)
(compare Sections 7 and 8 and the Figs. 12 and 17). In a few cases,
in which the ZFS energies are smaller than 1 cm−1 , the information results from ODMR (optically detected magnetic resonance)
measurements [198–202].
The emission decay times I , II , and III , as shown in columns
5–7, are determined from temperature dependent plots of the thermalized emission decay time according to Eq. (20).
Column 8 gives the emission decay time av (300 K) calculated
by use of the three individual emission decay times of the T1 substates ( I , II , and III ) and of the zero-ﬁeld splitting values EI,II
and EI,III according to Eq. (20) for a temperature of 300 K. The
measured emission decay time at 300 K, if obtainable, is displayed
in column 9 and the decay time at 77 K in column 10. Several compounds do not emit at ambient temperature, such as [Rh(bpy)3 ]3+
(1), Pd(qol)2 (2), and Pd(thpy)2 (3). Particularly in these situations
the data given in column 8 are helpful. Data from the columns 4
and 8 (printed in bold style) are used for the plot shown in Fig. 8.
In columns 11 and 12, we summarize the emission maxima at
300 K and 77 K, respectively.
Column 13 gives values of emission quantum yields at ambient
temperature. Only reliable values or data which have been remeasured recently by use of techniques as described in Ref. [40] are
included in the table.
Finally, column 14 contains references in which data for the
compounds are given.
Table 3 reproduces additional data for four selected compounds.
Data for these are also summarized in Table 2. However, for these
materials, additionally the emission decay times and emission
quantum yields were measured over the extended temperature
range of 1.2 K ≤ T ≤ 300 K. Thus, the individual radiative and nonradiative decay rates of the T1 substates (columns 4–6) could be
determined by the procedure as described in Section 8 and Refs.
[40,172] for the example of Ir(ppy)3 . The data in columns 3 ( EI,III )
r (300 K)) (printed in bold style) are used for the plot shown
and 7 ( av
in Fig. 8 (open symbols). These data are particularly valuable, since
r
av (300 K) represents the averaged radiative decay time of the three
triplet substates at ambient temperature. Since these values ﬁt perfectly to the plot of Fig. 8, the general validity of this trend is set on
a ﬁrmer basis.

Fig. 10. Absorption, excitation and emission spectra of Ir(dm-2-piq)2 (acac) (51) in
CH2 Cl2 measured at ambient temperature and at 77 K, respectively. The inset shows
the structure of the compound.

7.1. Spectroscopic introduction
Fig. 10 shows the absorption, excitation, and emission spectra
of Ir(dm-2-piq)2 (acac) measured in CH2 Cl2 at 300 K and 77 K. The
observed transitions are assigned similarly as for related Ir(III) compounds like Ir(ppy)3 (52) (see Section 8.1) and Ir(btp)2 (acac) (25)
[179] (compare also [243]). The strong absorptions in the wavelength region below ≈375 nm can be assigned to spin-allowed
␲–␲* transitions corresponding to 1 LC states centered at the
cyclometallating (2-(dimethylphenyl)-isoquinoline) ligands. Maxima are observed at 280 nm and 352 nm. Absorption bands in the
range between ≈390 nm and ≈515 nm are assigned to overlapping spin allowed d–␲* transitions (1 MLCT states) with maxima
at 405 nm (shoulder), 430 nm and 479 nm. The weaker absorption
tail at wavelengths above ≈520 nm involves mainly 3 MLCT states.
These assignments should not be taken too strictly, since the LC
and MLCT states are usually mixed. The broad and unstructured
deep-red emission at T = 300 K has its maximum at 623 nm. Cooling
the sample to T = 77 K leads to a slightly more structured emission. The dominating emission peak at that temperature is located
at 602 nm. This band overlaps with the peak of lowest energy at
573 nm observed in the 77 K excitation spectrum. Thus, these bands
are assigned to the electronic S0 ↔ T1 transitions which exhibit a
Stokes shift of about 800 cm−1 . The weaker emission maximum at
652 nm, being separated by about 1270 cm−1 from the main maximum, is assigned to overlapping vibrational satellites of ground
state modes.
At ambient temperature, Ir(dm-2-piq)2 (acac) (51) is highly
emissive. The photoluminescence quantum yield in degassed
CH2 Cl2 solution amounts to PL ≈ 50% and in PMMA under nitrogen
atmosphere to PL ≈ 80%. In CH2 Cl2 solution, the emission decays
with = 1.7 ␮s and in a PMMA ﬁlm with = 1.6 ␮s. Accordingly, for
the compound doped into PMMA, the radiative and nonradiative
decay rates are kr = 5 × 105 s−1 and knr = 1.3 × 105 s−1 .
7.2. Temperature dependence of the emission

7. Case study Ir(dm-2-piq)2 (acac) – Red light emitter
Red light emitting organo-transition metal compounds with
high emission quantum yields are relatively rare, since for materials
with small energy gaps between the emitting state and the ground
state nonradiative decay, governed by the “energy gap law” (Section
5.2.2), is frequently more effective than radiative decay (Section
4). In the present section, we want to discuss properties of the
very efﬁcient organo-metallic red light emitter Ir(dm-2-piq)2 (acac)
(51).

Fig. 11 shows emission spectra of Ir(dm-2-piq)2 (acac) in frozen
CH2 Cl2 at different temperatures. These spectra exhibit a similar
temperature dependence as found for Ir(ppy)3 (see Section 8 and
Refs. [40,175]). At 1.2 K, the emission results mainly from the lowest
triplet substate I and has its maximum at 612 nm. Since the decay
time at 1.2 K is very long ( I = 124 ␮s, see below), it can be concluded
that the transition I → 0 is largely forbidden. Thus, the emission
of substate I is mainly induced by processes of spin-vibronic
coupling (Herzberg–Teller (HT) coupling) with higher lying sin-

glet states. These processes induce emission intensity to speciﬁc
vibrational satellites, but not to the electronic 0–0 transition
[78,79,175,244,245]. However, the individual vibrational satellite
lines are smeared out because of the inhomogenous distribution of
the emitter complex in the matrix and because of (homogeneous)
electron–phonon coupling [79,197]. With increasing temperature,
the higher lying T1 substates II and III are thermally populated. Since
the electronic transitions from these triplet substates to the ground
state are signiﬁcantly more allowed, the corresponding emission
spectra are dominated by (homogeneously and imhomogenously
broadened) electronic transitions and Franck–Condon activated
vibrational satellites [78,175]. As a consequence, the emission is
slightly blue shifted. At 77 K, for example, its maximum is found at
602 nm. It is remarked that a similar behavior has been observed
for [Ru(bpy)3 ]2+ already a long time ago [190,192,246–248].
7.3. Emission decay times of the individual triplet substates and
energy level diagram
The emission decay curve of Ir(dm-2-piq)2 (acac) in polycrystalline CH2 Cl2 measured at T = 1.2 K is displayed in the inset of
Fig. 12. At T = 1.2 K, two decay components are observed. The long
component of 124 ␮s is ascribed to the deactivation time of the
lowest triplet substate I to the singlet ground state ( I ), while the
short component of about 300 ns is assigned to a relaxation (spinlattice relaxation, SLR) from substate II to substate I according to
the direct process of SLR [78,176]. With temperature increase, the
SLR processes become faster. For example, at T = 20 K the fast decay
component is no longer observable.
As described in Sections 6 and 8.4, emission decay data determined in a larger temperature range allow us also to deduce the
individual emission decay times II and III of the two higher lying
triplet substates as well as the zero-ﬁeld splitting parameters EI,II
and EI,III . This is possible by ﬁtting Eq. (20) to the (thermalized) emission decay times measured at various temperatures. The
resulting ﬁt parameters are given in Fig. 12 and are summarized in
the energy level diagram depicted in Fig. 13.
For completeness, it is remarked that the emission decay curves
of Ir(dm-2-piq)2 (acac) in the temperature range 1.2 K ≤ T ≤ 116 K
are not strictly monoexponential. Besides SLR features at low
temperatures (see inset of Fig. 12), this behavior is caused by
inhomogeneity effects. By applying a relatively coarse approximation, a short and a long decay component can be determined

curve measured at T = 1.2 K. The decay time of 1.7 ␮s at 300 K was measured in
deaerated CH2 Cl2 solution. The individual decay times II and III for the T1 substates

(20) to the measured data.

from each non-monoexponential decay curve. Using these
data for the ﬁtting procedure, one obtains ranges of zero-ﬁeld
splitting energies and of individual emission decay times. This
approach has already successfully been carried out for other Ir(III)
compounds [40,102,233] (compare also Section 8.5). For Ir(dm2-piq)2 (acac) (51) in CH2 Cl2 , the following ranges are found:
6.5 ␮s ≤ II ≤ 8.6 ␮s,
330 ns ≤ III ≤ 440 ns,
80 ␮s ≤ I ≤ 124 ␮s,
9.5 cm−1 ≤ EI,II ≤ 10 cm−1 ,
150 cm−1 ≤ EI,III ≤ 160 cm−1 .
Although this spread of parameters is not very distinct as
compared to Ir(ppy)3 (52) [40] and Ir(4,6-dFppy)2 (pic) (36) [233],
the dependence of photophysical properties on the individual
host–environment in the same matrix as well as in different
matrices [102] seems to be speciﬁcally pronounced for Ir(III)
compounds. For further discussions and explanations see Section
8.5 and Refs. [40,102,233].
In conclusion, the emitting T1 state of Ir(dm-2-piq)2 (acac) (51)
can be assigned to be largely of 3 MLCT character. This is displayed in
the large total zero-ﬁeld splitting of E(ZFS) = 150 cm−1 (compare
Section 6). The amount of this splitting shows that spin–orbit coupling to higher lying 1,3 MLCT states is very effective. This manifests
itself also in the relatively large value of the (averaged) radiative
decay rate at ambient temperature of kr = 5 × 105 s−1 . This value

at T = 1.2 K, while the other data result from a ﬁt of Eq. (20) as displayed in Fig. 12.

compares to the one found for Ir(ppy)3 with kr = 6.9 × 105 s−1 (see
Section 8). Such large values combined with relatively low nonradiative rates and emission decay times at ambient temperature
being distinctly below 2 ␮s make these complexes highly attractive
for applications as emitters in OLEDs.
8. Case study Ir(ppy)3 – Green light emitter
Ir(ppy)3 (52) is one of the most famous emitters for OLED
applications [39,67–69,74,75,249–251]. It represents the leading
example for the success of the triplet harvesting effect (compare
Section 2). In this section, we want to introduce to photo-physical
properties of this emitter, in particular, focusing on the lowest
triplet state and its emission features.
8.1. Spectroscopic introduction
Fig. 14 shows absorption, excitation, and emission spectra of
Ir(ppy)3 (52) in CH2 Cl2 measured at ambient temperature and
at 77 K. The absorption bands below 300 nm are related to spinallowed ␲–␲* transitions (corresponding to 1 LC states) of the
cyclometallating ppy ligands. The broad and unresolved absorption
band at lower energy, peaking at 376 nm, is assigned to overlapping
spin allowed d–␲* transitions (corresponding to 1 MLCT states),
whereas absorptions between about 430 and 500 nm involve
3 MLCT states [40]. The classiﬁcations as 1 LC, 1 MLCT, or 3 MLCT states
should only be taken as guidelines, since mixing between the different states by conﬁguration interaction and/or spin–orbit coupling
can be signiﬁcant, in particular, due to the high density of states
in the corresponding ranges (compare Section 3). The emission at
ambient temperature is broad and unresolved and shows a maximum at 519 nm. The photoluminescence quantum yield of Ir(ppy)3
in degassed CH2 Cl2 solution amounts to PL = 90% and the emission
decay time is = 1.6 ␮s. In a PMMA host, values of PL = 96% and
= 1.4 ␮s are found. Thus, the radiative and the nonradiative rate at
T = 300 K, referring to the combined emissions from the three triplet
substates, amount to kr = 6.9 × 105 s−1 and knr = 3 × 104 s−1 , respectively. Cooling to 77 K results in a slightly structured spectrum
with a dominating peak at 514 nm and a (vibrationally induced)
satellite peak at 541 nm. The excitation spectrum at 77 K overlaps with the emission spectrum in the range of the transitions
between the electronic singlet ground state S0 and the emitting
triplet state T1 , representing a 3 MLCT state. The Stokes shift at 77 K
between the corresponding bands amounts to ≈600 cm−1 , which

is ascribed to the involvement of low-energy vibrational/phonon
modes [40].
8.2. Highly resolved spectra and energy level diagram for the
triplet state of Ir(ppy)3 in CH2 Cl2
Investigations at cryogenic temperatures of Ir(ppy)3 dissolved
(doped) in polycrystalline CH2 Cl2 show weak, but well resolved
electronic 0–0 transitions at the high energy side of the broad emission band (Fig. 15a). These spectra can be obtained under selective
excitation (see below). Also the excitation spectrum reveals well
resolved 0–0 transitions. Thus, the combined studies of emission
and excitation spectra allow us to identify three sharp electronic
origins, which are assigned to the three substates I, II, and III of the
triplet T1 . At T ≤ 3 K, only substate I emits. The electronic transition
I → 0 lies at 19,693 cm−1 (507.79 nm). This transition is only very
weakly allowed. For example, the decay time of substate I is as long
as I = 116 ␮s (see below). Thus, the corresponding excitation peak
could not be detected. With temperature increase, for example to
T = 4.2 K, a further sharp line grows in at 19,712 cm−1 (507.31 nm)
in the emission spectrum, lying 19 cm−1 higher in energy than the
line corresponding to origin I (Fig. 15a). This line is assigned to the
0–0 transition between substate II and the singlet electronic ground
state 0. It is signiﬁcantly more allowed than the transition involving substate I. Hence, the line II → 0 appears already at relatively
low temperature, although a thermal population via an activation
energy of 19 cm−1 is required. Moreover, the corresponding absorption is high enough to allow us to register the excitation peak, too
(Fig. 15a). As expected, it lies exactly (within limits of ±1 cm−1 )
at the same energy as the corresponding emission line. The higher
allowedness of the II → 0 transition also results in the much shorter
emission decay time of II = 6.4 ␮s of substate II as compared to substate I (see below). A third 0–0 transition, corresponding to triplet
substate III, is detected in the excitation spectrum at 19,863 cm−1
(503.45 nm). (This transition is used for excitation to obtain the
selectively excited emission shown in Fig. 15a.) An identiﬁcation
of this transition in the emission spectrum would require application of a signiﬁcantly higher temperature to provide sufﬁcient

thermal population of this state, lying 170 cm−1 higher in energy.
However, above about T = 25 K (corresponding to kB T ≈ 17 cm−1 ),
all resolved spectra disappear because of temperature induced
smearing-out effects, such as homogeneous electron–phonon coupling [40,79,197]. A still higher lying triplet substate could not be
found up to an energy of about 500 cm−1 [40]. Thus, it is concluded
that the three triplet substates identiﬁed represent the lowest
triplet term.
Fig. 16 displays the resulting energy level diagram for the lowest
triplet state of Ir(ppy)3 in CH2 Cl2 . The observed splitting, in particular, the large total ZFS of E(ZFS) = 170 cm−1 , allow us to conclude
that the emitting term is largely of MLCT character (compare Section 6) and that spin–orbit coupling to higher lying 1,3 MLCT states
is very effective (Section 4). Especially, strong 1 MLCT admixtures
are displayed in the short emission decay time of III = 200 ns. This
decay is almost purely radiative, since the emission quantum yield
is as high as 90% in a CH2 Cl2 solution and almost 100% in PMMA
(see also below). It is remarked that the conclusions concerning
the high MLCT character are in line with the results obtained from
theoretical investigations [83–85].
8.3. Broad band emission
The broad band emission spectra of Ir(ppy)3 in CH2 Cl2 , depicted
in Fig. 15b, exhibit a similar temperature dependence as described
above for the emission in the range of 0–0 transitions. The spectrum
at 1.5 K, resulting from the lowest substate I, shows an emission
band peaking at about 529 nm. Since the decay time is relatively
long with I = 116 ␮s, it is concluded that the transition I → 0 is
largely forbidden. It has been proposed in Ref. [175] that the
emission process from substate I is induced by vibronic coupling
(Herzberg–Teller (HT) coupling), in particular, by spin-vibronic
processes. These induce couplings to higher lying singlet states by
the involvements of speciﬁc vibrational modes. This results in an
occurrence of vibrational satellites, even when the purely electronic
0–0 transition is forbidden [78,79,175,244,245]. For Ir(ppy)3 , the
vibrational satellite lines are smeared out by overlapping satellites,
low-energy local phonon satellites, and strong (homogeneous)
electron–phonon coupling to the matrix. Thus, the corresponding
band maximum appears at 529 nm. With temperature increase,
the substates II and III are thermally populated. They carry significantly more allowedness with respect to their 0–0 transitions to
the electronic ground state than substate I. Thus, the corresponding emission spectra are dominated by the phonon sidebands of
the electronic transitions and by Franck–Condon active vibrational
satellites [78,79,175]. Since the electronic transitions grow in with
temperature increase and since the vibrational energies of HT- and

FC-active modes are usually different, an emission band with a blue
shifted maximum appears near 514 nm (compare Fig. 15b).
8.4. Emission decay times of the individual triplet substates
Studies of the emission decay time and its temperature dependence provide valuable information on the individual triplet
substates. At T = 1.5 K, only substate I is populated. Therefore,
the corresponding decay time can be determined directly. With
increasing temperature, the higher lying triplet substates are populated according to the Boltzmann distribution. This prevents a
direct measurement of the individual decay times of the substates
II and III. However, for a determination of the lifetimes of these
substates, the indirect method as described in Section 6 can be
applied, which makes use of the temperature dependence of the
experimentally accessible thermalized (averaged) emission decay
time.
Fig. 17 reproduces results of the emission decay measurements
of Ir(ppy)3 in CH2 Cl2 for the temperature range 1.5 K ≤ T ≤ 300 K.
By carrying out the ﬁtting procedure according to Eq. (20) with
ﬁxed energy separations of EI,II = 19 cm−1 and EI,III = 170 cm−1
known from the high-resolution spectra, and with a ﬁxed decay
time of I = 116 ␮s, recorded at 1.5 K, the two remaining free ﬁt
parameters are determined to II = 6.4 ␮s and III = 0.2 ␮s [40]. The
resulting information is summarized in Figs. 16 and 17.
8.5. Studies of Ir(ppy)3 doped into PMMA
Ir(ppy)3 studied in a PMMA ﬁlm shows only broad emission
bands. However, investigations in an extended temperature range
from 1.2 K up to about 370 K without any solid/liquid phase transition are possible in this matrix, in contrast to the situation
using CH2 Cl2 . Information on the individual substates can still be
obtained by analyzing the temperature dependence of the thermalized emission decay time, as described in the preceding section.
Again, it is required to measure the emission decay curves (at
a low concentration of Ir(ppy)3 ) over an extended temperature
range. As expected and dissimilar to the situation found for the
speciﬁc site of Ir(ppy)3 in CH2 Cl2 , these curves are not monoexponential because of inhomogeneity effects. Accordingly, a similar ﬁt
as described in Section 8.4, is not straightforward. However, in a

very rough approximation, one can estimate ranges of ZFS energies
and of individual emission decay times simply by using a short and
a long decay component, respectively, for every measured multiexponential decay (compare also Section 7.3). With these data and
applying Eq. (20) ﬁts can be carried out. Thus, data sets are obtained,
which represent approximate ranges of inhomogeneous distributions. Similar approaches have already been applied successfully
in Refs. [40,102,233]. The resulting ranges of data are summarized
in Table 4. For comparison, the values determined for Ir(ppy)3 in
CH2 Cl2 are also given.
Interestingly, the photophysical properties of the 3 MLCT state of
Ir(ppy)3 in PMMA are somewhat different as compared to the situation found for CH2 Cl2 . In particular, the splitting of the triplet state
is smaller and the individual decay times are longer in PMMA than
in CH2 Cl2 . These differences can be explained by slight variations
of metal d-orbital energies and changes of d- and ␲-orbital mixing,
for example, because of matrix cage-induced geometry variations
(compare Sections 3 and 4). These effects alter the SOC efﬁciencies
and thus the ZFS and the emission decay times [79,87,102,233].
In other words, also the effects of mixing-in singlet character to
the triplet substates via SOC are sensitive to the environment. It is
remarked that especially triplet substate III determines the OLED
performance crucially due to the high radiative rate of the transition from this substate to the electronic ground state (compare the
values given in Table 4 for III ).

8.6. Radiative and nonradiative decay rates and emission
quantum yields of the individual triplet substates
The emission quantum yield and the radiative and nonradiative
decay rates of Ir(ppy)3 have been investigated in PMMA for the
temperature range of 1.5 K ≤ T ≤ 370 K [40]. Fig. 18 shows the temperature dependence of the emission quantum yield. In the range
from 80 K up to 370 K, PL is almost constant and lies between 96%
and 97%. For the temperature range of ≈80 K ≤ T ≤ 300 K, a similar
value was reported in Ref. [39]. However, below 80 K our results
differ from those of Ref. [39]. The quantum yield decreases from
96% to about 88% at 1.5 K. Between 12 K and 22 K a “plateau” with
PL ≈ 90% is observed. This behavior can be explained by the individual and different radiative and nonradiative rate constants of the
three T1 substates. At T = 1.5 K, only substate I is populated. Its quantum yield amounts to PL (I) ≈ 88%. Temperature increase leads to
a population of substate II and at higher temperatures also of substate III. Between 12 K and 22 K, the emission stems dominantly
from substate II which exhibits a quantum yield of about 90%, giving
the ﬁrst “plateau”. At temperatures above 80 K, the emission from
substate III dominates and a second and more extended plateau
at a value of about 96% is found up to T ≈ 370 K. The temperature
dependence of the emission quantum yield PL (T) (Fig. 18) can be
used to determine the radiative and nonradiative rate constants for
the transitions of the three individual triplet substates to the elec-

r are the radiative decay rates of the three

triplet substates I, II, and III, respectively, while kI , kII , and kIII represent the total decay rates of these substates. These latter parameters
are equal to the reciprocals of the experimentally determined individual decay times I , II , and III , respectively.
Eq. (22) contains eight independent variables, of which the energies EI,II and EI,III as well as the rate constants kI , kII , and kIII
can be extracted from Table 4, where ranges of ZFSs and emission
decay times are given. We simply choose values lying in the center of these ranges. Thus, the number of independent variables in
Eq. (22) is reduced from eight to three. With the mean values of
EI,II = 12.2 cm−1 , EI,III = 125 cm−1 , kI = 1/(155 ␮s) = 6.5 × 103 s−1 ,
kII = 1/(15.5 ␮s) = 6.5 × 104 s−1 , and kIII = 1/(0.33 ␮s) = 3.0 × 106 s−1 ,
the ﬁt procedure, applying the data of Fig. 18 and using Eq. (22),
gives the radiative decay rates of the individual triplet substates. By
applying Eq. (3) and taking into account that i = 1/ki (with i = I, II,
and III), the individual radiative and nonradiative rate constants as
well as the quantum yields of the three substates can be calculated.
These data are summarized in Table 5.
The data displayed in Table 5 show that the radiative decay
rates of the three substates of the T1 state are strongly different.
This is already known from the highly resolved excitation spectrum of Ir(ppy)3 in CH2 Cl2 , since the corresponding intensities are
proportional to the radiative rates (compare Fig. 15a). Here, we see
again that the radiative rate for the transition from substate I to the
singlet ground state is with kIr = 5.7 × 103 s−1 very small. This displays the forbiddenness of this transition. It is remarked that this
rate is given by the sum of all radiative transitions from substate
I, including the 0–0 transition as well as all (smeared out) vibrational satellites. Since these are largely Herzberg–Teller induced,
i.e. induced by spin-vibronic coupling (compare [78,79,175] and
Section 8.3), the allowedness of the purely electronic 0–0 transition is extremely small. Therefore, substate I can be regarded as a
relatively pure triplet substate with very little direct SOC to higher
lying singlets. Interestingly, this is in line with conclusions from
theoretical investigations of Nozaki [83].
On the other hand, the substates II and III exhibit radiative rates
with respect to the transitions to the ground state, which are by a
factor of about 10 and 500, respectively, greater than the rate of the

I → 0 transition. This is a consequence of distinctly stronger SOCs
of the substates II and III to higher lying 1 MLCT states (compare
Fig. 15, Section 4 and Refs. [79,83,86,87]).
Interestingly, the nonradiative rates of the three substates are
also very different from each other. The nonradiative rate of
substate I is almost one order of magnitude smaller than the
nonradiative rate of substate II. This behavior is ascribed to the spinforbiddenness of the radiationless relaxation process from substate
I to the ground state. Such spin-dependent restrictions are also
well known for intersystem crossing processes in purely organic
molecules [30]. With increasing singlet admixture, these restrictions are less conﬁning and thus, the nonradiative rates kIInr and
nr become larger. A numerical comparison with the data given
kIII
nr , however, is not straightforward, since the given
in Table 5 for kIII
value strongly depends on the experimental error of the measured
PL value.
The individual quantum yields of the triplet substates display
a behavior according to that of the individual radiative rates.
Substate III exhibits the highest radiative rate and therefore,
the highest quantum yield among the triplet substates, followed
by substate II. Substate I shows the lowest individual quantum
yield. It is stressed that the measured value of PL at ambient
temperature represents an averaged value that stems from the
emissions of all three triplet substates according to their individual
populations.

represents an almost pure triplet and exhibits only a very small
nonradiative decay rate of kInr = 8 × 102 s−1 , while substate III with
signiﬁcant singlet admixtures exhibits a relatively large value of
nr ≈ 1 × 105 s−1 . Thus, it becomes obvious that the extent of SOC
kIII
essentially determines also nonradiative rates.
The results further reveal that the emission properties of
Ir(ppy)3 depend on its environment. For example, for Ir(ppy)3
in PMMA, the total ZFS is inhomogeneously distributed over a
range of 115–135 cm−1 and becomes as large as 170 cm−1 in
CH2 Cl2 . Accordingly, the emission decay time of substate III, representing the most important substate determining the radiative
properties at ambient temperature, varies between 200 and 330 ns.
Such effects were also observed for other Ir(III) compounds and
could be rationalized by matrix cage-induced variations of the
complex geometry which can alter energy separations between
occupied d-orbitals and/or d- and ␲-orbitals (see Section 7 and
Refs. [102,233]). Beside shifts of d-orbital energies, resulting in
shifts of 1,3 MLCT states, also changes of d–␲ mixing occur. Thus,
the SOC strengths are changed and therefore, modiﬁcations of crucial photophysical properties result. Consequently, an optimization
of the OLED performance should take the immediate environment
of the emitting complex, i.e. the matrix material, also into deeper
consideration.

for singlet harvesting

8.7. Concluding remarks
The large zero-ﬁeld splitting of 170 cm−1 of the lowest
triplet state of Ir(ppy)3 allows us to assign this state as being
largely of 3 MLCT character (compare Sections 4 and 6 and Refs.
[33,78,79,86,87]). This assignment results also from theoretical
investigations [83–85]. The large energy separation between the
T1 substates is a consequence of effective spin–orbit couplings
(SOC) between these substates and higher lying triplet and singlet MLCT states involving d-orbitals other than the emitting triplet
state. The zero-ﬁeld splitting results from different interactions
via SOC. Obviously, substate I experiences mainly an interaction with substates of other 3 MLCT states, while the substates II
and especially III exhibit also signiﬁcant SOCs with 1 MLCT states
(compare Section 4). This leads to the very short emission decay
time of III ≈ 330 ns of Ir(ppy)3 in PMMA and of only III ≈ 200 ns
in CH2 Cl2 . These values represent almost purely radiative decay
times.
The result, showing that the nonradiative decay rates of the
three substates of Ir(ppy)3 differ by more than two orders of magnitude, is of particular interest and has not yet been recognized
before. With respect to the discussions presented in Section 5.2.2,
one can assume that all terms in Eq. (14) are largely equal for the
three triplet substates except for the ﬁrst term, representing the
electronic coupling term ln(ˇ). According to Eq. (18), this contribution to the nonradiative decay is small for weak SOC and can
become signiﬁcant for strong SOC. Indeed, this is displayed with
respect to the three substates of Ir(ppy)3 . In particular, substate I

The development of blue and white light emitting phosphorescent materials is still a challenge. Especially, the efﬁciency of blue
light emission with Ir(III) or Pt(II) complexes (with suitably high
T1 energy) depends strongly on the energy separation between the
emitting triplet state and higher lying metal centered states of dd*
character. These strongly quench the emission, if they are thermally
accessible at ambient temperature, i.e. if the energy separation to
the T1 state is less than about 3000 cm−1 (compare Section 5.2.1).
Thus, it suggests itself to introduce other emitter materials which
do not show these difﬁculties. In this respect, Cu(I) complexes with
a d10 ground state conﬁguration come into the focus of investigations, since low-lying unoccupied d* orbitals are not present.
Therefore, emission quenching via population of dd* states is not
a problem. However, the (radiative) emission decay times for the
T1 → S0 transitions of Cu(I) compounds are usually extremely long
and amount to many hundreds of ␮s up to ms [52–54,252,253].
Compounds with such long decay times would not be well suited
as emitters in OLEDs since an extremely strong efﬁciency roll-off
can be expected (compare Section 2).
However, speciﬁc Cu(I) complexes can exhibit a pronounced
thermally activated delayed ﬂuorescence of the lowest excited
singlet state at ambient temperature [52–54,252–255]. Thus, the
application of such materials, that make use of the singlet harvesting effect (see Section 2), as efﬁcient emitters in OLEDs should
be possible. Moreover, Cu(I) complexes are also attractive from
another point of view. The material’s costs are signiﬁcantly lower
than those of Pt(II) or Ir(III) based emitters.

crystalline and thus rigid environment (powder).6 It is of special
interest that the emission of the Cu(I) complex in PMMA is with
a halfwidth of about 4700 cm−1 relatively broad. Thus, the color
purity is rather poor. However, an emission shift towards white
light is obtained, though with a still not satisfactory color rendering index (CRI)). We relate the occurrence of this broad emission
to the large Stokes shift and a distribution of local environments
of the Cu(POP)(pz2 BH2 ) molecules in the host polymer. This leads
to a distribution of local hindrances and thus to a range of possible geometry changes. Obviously, this is a strategy for white light
generation. The resulting effect is displayed by the CIE color coordinates [262] that are given in Table 6. However, in the context of
the present investigation, we do not study this aspect further.
9.2. Triplet emission and thermally activated singlet emission

c = 5 × 10−5 mol/L, PMMA: c ≈ 0.5 wt%).

In this section, we present a new Cu(I) complex,
Cu(POP)(pz2 BH2 ) (see inset of Fig. 19), and discuss photophysical
properties of this blue/white light emitting material.
9.1. Spectroscopic introduction
Fig. 19 shows the absorption spectrum of Cu(POP)(pz2 BH2 ) in
CH2 Cl2 and the ambient temperature emission spectra of the compound as powder, doped into PMMA, and dissolved in CH2 Cl2 ,
respectively. The strong absorptions in the wavelength region
below 280 nm can be assigned to spin allowed ␲–␲* transitions
(1 LC states) of the POP ligand. The lower energy absorptions
between 310 and ≈370 nm are assigned to spin allowed d–␲*
transitions (1 MLCT states) involving the occupied 3d orbitals of
Cu(I) and the ␲* orbitals mainly of the POP ligand (compare Refs.
[256,257]).
Cu(POP)(pz2 BH2 ) is strongly luminescent in the solid state and
in PMMA, and moderately emissive in degassed liquid solutions.
Table 6 summarizes the respective emission data. As it is seen,
the emission properties of the material strongly depend on the
environment. While the emission of neat Cu(POP)(pz2 BH2 ) is blue
( max = 436 nm), it is blue/white in PMMA ( max = 462 nm) and
green in ﬂuid solution ( max = 535 nm), respectively. This latter red
shift is accompanied by a considerable reduction of the emission
quantum yield and a shortening of the emission decay time. These
observations can be explained by changes of the molecular geometry of the Cu(I) compound taking place after MLCT excitation. In
the electronic ground state, a pseudo-tetragonal orientation of the
coordinating ligands is energetically favored, while in the excited
MLCT state(s) a ﬂattening distortion occurs [54,255,258–261]. Such
a structural rearrangement leads to a smaller energy gap between
the excited state and the electronic ground state. Connected with
the geometry change, radiationless deactivation of the excited state
becomes more efﬁcient (compare also Section 5.2.2 and [54]). The
geometry rearrangement in the excited state occurs most easily in
ﬂuid solution, it is partly hindered in PMMA, and minimized in a

Fig. 20 shows emission spectra of Cu(POP)(pz2 BH2 ) powder at
temperatures ranging from 3 to 300 K. At all temperatures, the spectra are broad and unstructured. At 3 K, the emission is centered at
454 nm. Apart from a spectral broadening, no signiﬁcant change of
the emission proﬁle is observed up to T ≈ 140 K. However, with further temperature increase up to ambient temperature, the spectra
become signiﬁcantly broader, since a new emission band at higher
energy grows in. This leads to a blue shift of the emission maximum
by 18 nm.
The spectral blue shift with temperature increase is accompanied by a very pronounced change of the emission decay time.
In Fig. 21, emission decay curves recorded at various temperatures are shown. At T = 1.6 K, the measured decay is clearly
non-monoexponential. It can be ﬁtted with a bi-exponential decay
function, yielding time constants of 300 ␮s and 2.8 ms. With a slight
temperature increase, the decay remains non-monoexponential,
but above T ≈ 15 K, a long decay component strongly prevails. At
30 K, the emission decays mono-exponentially with a time constant
of 630 ␮s. Further temperature increase leads at ﬁrst only to a minor
reduction of the decay time. At T = 115 K, for example, it amounts to
590 ␮s. However, at temperatures of T > 130 K, the emission decay
time decreases drastically to a value of 20 ␮s at 300 K.
The observations described above indicate the involvement of
different energy states in dependence of temperature. Four different temperature ranges may be distinguished: (i) 1.6 K ≤ T < 30 K,
(ii) 30 K ≤ T < 120 K, (iii) 120 K ≤ T < 250 K, and (iv) T ≥ 250 K. At
very low temperature, the emission originates from the substates
of the lowest triplet state. As generally agreed in the literature
[253,259,260,263–265], this state is largely of 3 MLCT character. It is
expected that its total zero-ﬁeld splitting E(ZFS) is much smaller
for Cu(I) complexes than for Ir(III) or Pt(II) compounds, since the

6
For completeness, it is remarked that for the neat material, effects of
energy transfer between the emitter complexes, as well as self-quenching and
triplet–triplet-annihilation do not seem to be important. This can be rationalized
by assuming at least a small geometry change in the excited state even for the
neat material. Accordingly, the resonance condition required for the occurrence
of radiationless energy transfer processes between excited and non-excited complexes is no longer fulﬁlled. Consequently, emission self-quenching and quenching
by triplet-triplet annihilation become less probable.

Ir(III) or Pt(II) [196]. Nevertheless, a splitting of the corresponding
triplet of the order of 10 cm−1 is possible [263].
Presumably, such a splitting leads to the distinctly nonmonoexponential decay curves in the temperature range (i). Under
the assumption that intermolecular processes, such as energy
transfer, may be disregarded, the decay curve at T = 1.6 K with
components of 300 ␮s and 2.8 ms (Fig. 21) can be rationalized as
follows: At this temperature and at a small energy separation of at
least two triplet substates (possibly of 1 or 2 cm−1 ), processes of
spin-lattice relaxation are slow [176]. As a consequence, the states
emit according to their individual decay times. With temperature
increase, the SLR processes become faster and near T = 30 K the
population of the T1 substates is equilibrated. This leads to a monoexponential decay with an averaged decay time av from about
30 K up to 120 K (range (ii)) [78,79,176,208,209,212,266]. The corresponding decay time can be expressed by Eq. (23), which is deduced
from Eq. (20) for E(ZFS) kB T [78,79,266].

where 1 , II , and III represent the emission decay times of the individual triplet substates I, II, and III, respectively. Very frequently, av
corresponds in a good approximation to the measured decay time
of the three thermally equilibrated triplet substates. In the present
case, the decay times of all three substates are not known. However, assuming in a relatively coarse approximation a value of the
order of one ms for the third component and inserting it into Eq.
(23) together with the experimentally determined time constants
of 300 ␮s and 2.8 ms (Fig. 21), an averaged decay time of ≈640 ␮s
would be obtained. This values would ﬁt to the measured decay
time at T = 30 K of = 630 ␮s.7
In the temperature range (ii), the emission decay time is characterized by a plateau with a time constant of about 610 ␮s. This value
does not decrease signiﬁcantly up to ≈120 K (Fig. 22). In this range,
the emission of Cu(POP)(pz2 BH2 ) stems from all three thermally
equilibrated triplet substates.

excitation at exc = 355 nm and detected at det = 450 nm (compare Ref. [256]).

For completeness, it is remarked that the emission decay curve measured at
T = 1.6 K (Fig. 21) could formally be well described by use of the three time constants
discussed.

In the temperature range (iii) up to 250 K, the decay time
becomes distinctly shorter (Fig. 22) and the emission maximum
is blue shifted (Fig. 20). This indicates that a higher lying electronic state with a larger deactivation rate becomes involved
(i.e. thermally populated). In analogy to other Cu(I) compounds
[53,54,253,254,263], this state is assigned as the lowest excited
singlet state S1 .
Finally, for temperatures higher than ≈250 K (range (iv)), the
emission stemming from the S1 state strongly dominates. It represents a delayed thermally activated ﬂuorescence.
Under the assumption of a fast thermalization between the T1
and the S1 state, an average decay time can be expressed in analogy
to Eq. (20), giving Eq. (24).

(T1 ) and (S1 ) are the intrinsic decay times of the emitting triplet
and singlet state, respectively, and E(S1 − T1 ) is the energy separation (activation energy) between the two states.
For a ﬁt of Eq. (24) to the experimental data, the parameter (T1 )
was kept constant at 610 ␮s, representing the averaged value of
the plateau in the temperature range (ii) of 30 K ≤ T < 120 K. The ﬁt
is depicted in Fig. 22 and reveals parameters of (S1 ) = 30 ns and
E(S1 − T1 ) = 1300 cm−1 . This value of E(S1 − T1 ) corresponds to
the energy difference between the T1 state and the S1 state. The
obtained data are summarized in the energy level diagram as shown
in Fig. 23.
9.3. Singlet harvesting with Cu(I) complexes
The analysis of the emission behavior of Cu(POP)(pz2 BH2 ) has
shown that this material may be well suited for singlet harvesting
in an OLED device (compare Section 2). This is illustrated by use of
Fig. 23.
A “pure” triplet emitter based on Cu(I) complexes exhibits a very
long emission decay time. Thus, such materials would be expected
to exhibit only a poor performance as OLED emitter, even if triplet
harvesting (Section 2) is effective. However, for Cu(POP)(pz2 BH2 ),
the singlet state S1 is easily thermally accessible at ambient temperature. This state carries a high deactivation rate with respect to
the S1 → S0 transition ( (S1 ) = 30 ns). Thus, a thermally activated
population of the S1 state leads to a much faster (averaged) emis-

Fig. 23. Emission properties of Cu(POP)(pz2 BH2 ) powder and singlet harvesting. At
T ≤ 120 K, the emission stems only from the lowest triplet state T1 with a decay
time of its three thermalized substates of 610 ␮s. At T = 300 K, a thermally activated
(delayed) ﬂuorescence from the S1 with a decay time of 20 ␮s is observed, while
the decay time of the prompt ﬂuorescence is estimated to about 30 ns by the ﬁtting
procedure as described in the text and displayed in Fig. 22. In an electroluminescence
excitation, one singlet and three triplet paths populate the S1 and the T1 state. In
principle, all excitons can be harvested, and because of efﬁcient intersystem crossing
from the T1 state to the S1 state the emission occurs as delayed S1 ﬂuorescence.

sion decay of the two states. Accordingly, the decay time drops
by a factor of about 30 from 610 ␮s to 20 ␮s at T = 300 K. At this
temperature, the thermally activated delayed ﬂuorescence strongly
prevails.
the
rates
of
k(S1 → S0 ) = 1/(30 ns)
and
Inserting
k(T1 → S0 ) = 1/(610 ␮s) as well as the activation energy of
E(S1 − T1 ) = 1300 cm−1 into Eq. (1) and ignoring nonradiative
processes in this estimate, it is seen that at ambient temperature
the ﬂuorescence intensity predominates by a factor of about 40
over the phosphorescence. Interestingly, if blue light emission
is aspired, the activation process is favorable, since the ﬂuorescence is blue shifted by as much as 18 nm with respect to the
phosphorescence maximum.
Applying electroluminescence excitation to this compound, one
singlet path and three triplet paths populate the S1 state and the T1
state, respectively. SOC is large enough to induce fast intersystem
crossing (ISC). At T = 300 K, both down and up ISC processes occur.
Since the rate for a triplet emission is much smaller than the ISC
rate, the excitation originally gathered in the T1 state (three triplet
paths) is radiatively deactivated via the S1 state. Equivalently, the
excitation energy that originally populates the S1 state (one singlet
path) is also deactivated as S1 → S0 emission. In sum, the singlet
state harvests and emits, at least predominantly, all generated excitons (apart from losses due to intrinsic non-radiative processes that
are displayed by the photoluminescence quantum yield PL ). Interestingly, this new principle has also been applied recently in a green
light emitting OLED [252]. Other realizations of OLEDs employing
Cu(I) complexes as emitters [267–270] also support this strategy
simply by demonstrating efﬁcient devices.
In summary, it is remarked that Cu(POP)(pz2 BH2 ) represents a
very good example for the manifestation of the singlet harvesting
effect. However, an emission decay time of 20 ␮s at T = 300 K is still
too long for high brightness OLED applications. Developments of
improved materials with smaller E(S1 − T1 ) values are currently
in progress.
10. Conclusion
In this comprehensive study, we deepen the understanding of
the triplet state of organo-transition metal emitters. A series of
trends and relations between molecular structures and photophysical properties of the complexes is revealed.
In particular, spin-orbit coupling (SOC) determines crucially the
emission behavior. For example, SOC is responsible for the emission decay times and quantum yields of the emitters. It is well
known, that SOC determines the radiative rates of the transitions
from the triplet substates to the electronic ground state. However, it
is not so well known that also the nonradiative decay rates depend
signiﬁcantly on SOC. These rates increase with growing SOC. This
behavior is exempliﬁed by investigating the three triplet substates
of Ir(ppy)3 with respect to their individual radiative and nonradiative rates. A corresponding trend is also manifested by a comparison
of a series of Pt(II) and Ir(III) complexes with the same ligands,
such as the couples of Pt(4,6-dFppy)(acac)/Ir(4,6-dFppy)2 (acac) or
Pt(thpy)(acac)/Ir(thpy)2 (acac).
SOC also regulates the amount of energy splitting (zero-ﬁeld
splitting, E(ZFS)) of the triplet state into substates. Accordingly,
very effective SOC induces large E(ZFS) values and frequently also
high radiative rates, in particular, to the transition from the highest triplet substate to the electronic singlet ground state. However,
at large E(ZFS) values, the average emission decay time of the
three triplet substates at ambient temperature is not signiﬁcantly
reduced, even with high SOC efﬁciency. This is a consequence of the
fact that emission properties are not only governed by the shortest
lived triplet substate, but by all three substates weighted by a Boltzmann distribution. Thus, based on an extensive data set, an impor-

H. Yersin et al. / Coordination Chemistry Reviews 255 (2011) 2622–2652

tant trend becomes evident. It is indicated that the shortest (radiative) emission decay time of the type of materials investigated (and
usually applied in OLEDs) cannot be signiﬁcantly reduced to less
than about 1 ␮s. This implicates problems concerning the development of emitter materials for high brightness OLED lighting.
It is also shown that the SOC efﬁciency distinctly depends on
the geometry of a complex. This result is based on a series of
experimental data and is explained in a comprehensible model.
In particular, the effects of SOC can be signiﬁcantly larger for
quasi-octahedral Ir(III) or even Ru(II) complexes than for quasisquare-planar Pt(II) complexes. Moreover, the efﬁciency of SOC
and thus its inﬂuence on the radiative properties depends also on
the immediate environment of the emitter. This is demonstrated
by case studies investigating Ir(ppy)3 and also other emitters in
various matrices in detail.
Currently, an extensive research is directed towards the development of efﬁcient and stable blue light emitters that emit from
3 MLCT (3 d␲*) states. However, very frequently quenching dd*
states are populated from these 3 MLCT states at ambient temperature and thus, only low photoluminescence quantum yields
result. Therefore, it is aimed to energetically destabilize the lowest dd* states. Principally, this can be achieved by coordinating
either chromophoric or ancillary ligands with very high ligand ﬁeld
strengths (high Dq values). On the other hand, these ligands do not
only destabilize the d*-orbitals, but also stabilize the populated dorbitals. Thus, also the 3 MLCT states shift to higher energies. As
a consequence, the corresponding compound can become a 3 ␲␲*
emitter, which exhibits an undesirably long emission decay time.
Thus, this material would be less well suited for OLED applications.
Obviously, only a detailed balance concerning the involvements of
d-/␲-orbitals in the lowest excited states might solve these problems.
Moreover, most compounds, when being excited, undergo
certain geometry relaxations with respect to the ground state
geometry, at least in a non-rigid environment. Such effects are
particularly important for blue light 3 MLCT emitters, since geometry changes also stabilize the dd* states and thus, quenching can
become more effective. This behavior is shortly addressed with
respect to properties of the sky-blue light emitter Ir(biqa)3 . In a
moderately rigid polymer (PMMA), the activation energy to the
quenching state is already rather low and therefore, the emission quantum yield is reduced from almost 100% at 180 K to 50%
at ambient temperature and drops further to 10% in a ﬂuid solution (2-Me-THF). In this environment, the activation energy to the
quenching state amounts to 2350 cm−1 .
The extensive discussions of triplet state properties are completed by presentations of case studies referring to highly efﬁcient
emitters. Thus, two Ir(III) compounds, the phosphorescent red light
emitter Ir(dm-2-piq)2 (acac) with PL = 80% and the phosphorescent
green light emitter Ir(ppy)3 with PL of almost 100%, respectively,
are characterized in detail. With respect to the emission properties,
these materials are very well suited for OLED applications that are
based on the triplet harvesting effect. In a third case study, the blue
light emitting Cu(I) complex Cu(POP)(pz2 BH2 ) is characterized.
Because of a d10 conﬁguration of the electronic ground state, this
material does not exhibit quenching by dd* states. Interestingly, at
ambient temperature, this Cu(I) complex represents a singlet emitter. At least in principle, such emitters may be applied to harvest
100% of the generated singlet and triplet excitons according to the
singlet harvesting effect. Potentially, this effect may successfully
be applied in future not only to develop new and cheaper emitters,
it may also be possible to reduce the average (radiative) emission
decay time of the thermally activated ﬂuorescence to below the
limit that is found for typical triplet emitters. If successful, this
strategy will help to reduce the roll-off of the OLED efﬁciency for
lighting, even at high brightness applications.
