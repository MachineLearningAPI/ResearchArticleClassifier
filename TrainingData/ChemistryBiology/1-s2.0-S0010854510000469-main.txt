Nanoparticle (NP) catalysis in liquid phase, which is usually called “soluble” NP catalysis, is an old topic
but is now well advanced due to the great progress in nano-chemistry and nano-technology in green
chemistry. After a short introduction of the history, this review describes the current status of NP catalysis in solvents and then discusses the main drawbacks hindering the particles from industrial practice.
Efﬁciency, stability, sustainability, and recyclability (ESSR) criteria were suggested to evaluate NP catalytic systems. A state-of-the-art approach to satisfy ideal ESSR criteria is to produce cohesion over the
individual contributions of metal center, stabilizer and solvent (MSS), i.e., a cohesive MSS approach. Based
on reported examples, the roles that the metal core, the stabilizer and the solvent play in NP catalysis
are discussed in detail. For clarity, a fairly complete list of NP catalytic systems in various green solvents
reported in recent decade is provided.

1. Introduction
Nanocatalysis has undergone great prosperity in the past
decade. A simple search through Sciﬁnder with the key word
“nanocatalysis” clearly indicates an exponential growth in scientiﬁc publications in the past 15 years (Fig. 1). In 2008 alone, for
example, the number of publications was nearly 7000. One of the
main branches of nanocatalysis is nanoparticle (NP) catalysis in
liquid phase. NP catalysis in traditional solvents originated from
colloidal chemistry that dated back to 19th century when Pt NPs
were used to decompose hydrogen peroxide [1]. Since 1990, it
became an independent ﬁeld usually called colloidal catalysis or
quasi-homogenous catalysis since it was believed, at that time, to
be a bridge between classical homogenous catalysis and heterogeneous catalysis. “Soluble” NPs in solution phase enabled the direct
usage of in situ techniques such as in situ IR and in situ NMR, which
were successfully used in homogenous complex catalysis for mechanistic studies [2]. In some cases, NPs were the real active parts for
the catalytic activity that molecular complexes generally showed
[3]. The higher efﬁciency of these NP catalysts under mild conditions, in comparison with that of traditional solid state catalysts,
was therefore thought to be due to their higher dispersion in solvent
and three-dimensional rotational freedom.
There are quite a few excellent reviews on NP catalysis [4]. We
would like to share our understanding of this ﬁeld rather than simply presenting reported examples. The current review, which tries
to give some clues to the improvement of NP catalysis for practical use, is divided into two main parts. The ﬁrst part begins with
introducing the efﬁciency, stability, sustainability, and recyclability (ESSR) criteria for the evaluation of a NP catalytic system which
aims at satisfying industry demands and is followed by a detailed
description of how to fulﬁll the ESSR criteria by designing the three

basic elements, namely, the metal core, the stabilizer and the solvent (MSS), of a NP catalytic system (Sections 2–5). The second part
is a collection of examples of NP catalysis in various green solvents
after 1999, with particular attention paid to water, ionic liquids
(ILs), supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2 ), ﬂuorous solvents and
high boiling point alcohols. Recent contributions from the authors’
lab are also presented (Section 6).
2. Toward an ideal nanoparticle catalytic system in solution
2.1. Evaluation: the ESSR criteria
The NPs in solution phase are heterogeneous in nature. However, they “appear” incredibly homogenous since the catalyst is
well dispersed in solvent so that the reactant reaches the catalytic site by diffusion. This feature endows the NP catalytic system
with intrinsic advantages and limitations quite similar to those of
the homogenous catalytic system. Homogeneous catalysts, usually transition metal complexes, present advantages of working
at rather low temperature and giving very good selectivity. Moreover, homogeneous catalysts are usually structurally well-deﬁned.
Thus by implementing a structure–reactivity relationship, rational
development of more efﬁcient catalytic systems can be achieved for
a given reaction [5]. Drawbacks include catalyst decomposition and
complex separation of reactants/products from the homogeneous
system; NP catalysis faces exactly the same situation.
The efﬁciency of a catalyst is normally estimated by TOF
(turnover frequency per site per unit time). Homogeneous catalysts
usually have very good TOF, higher than thousand (h−1 ) at fairly low
temperature, usually around 100 ◦ C, while traditional solid state
catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis generally have quite low TOF,
less than hundred and even less than ten. Therefore, achieving a
higher TOF close to a homogenous catalyst and retaining easy separation similar to that of the solid state catalyst, is the basis for the
discussion of efﬁciency for a NP catalytic system. In fact, a higher
TOF is not very difﬁcult to obtain in a laboratory. We need, in a
commercial sense, a higher TTO (total turnover number) based
on a fair TOF, i.e. the stability of NP under reaction conditions is
extremely important. NPs are usually lower in stability especially
in comparison with the solid state catalysts. However, even for
those solid state catalysts, good stability is obtained from a balance
between efﬁciency and stability. This strategy may be adapted to
the improvement of NP catalysts. Currently, an NP catalytic system is carried out in batch mode. TTO is realized via recycling the
NPs. The recyclability of an NP system is normally a technical issue
including the retreatment of the NP and recycling the stabilizer and
the solvent. Easy separation, for example, by biphasic approach, and
other smart approaches of the stabilizer and the solvent may significantly improve the recyclability of NP catalytic system, and may
certainly enhance the possibility of an industrial application. We

N. Yan et al. / Coordination Chemistry Reviews 254 (2010) 1179–1218

therefore suggest that efﬁciency (E), stability (S), sustainability (S)
and recyclability (R) are the criteria, ESSR criteria, for the evaluation
of an NP catalytic system.
2.1.1. Efﬁciency
High efﬁciency, i.e. high selectivity at high conversion rate under
mild reaction conditions is the most prominent beneﬁt that an NP
catalyst can provide compared to typical heterogeneous catalysts.
A homogenous catalyst can usually be much more active and selective, and in organic synthesis can be optimized for the system [6].
In principle, the NP catalyst, in a solvent, has the same opportunity.
The high efﬁciency of an NP system relies mainly on the approach
to the metal core, including the screening of the metal, the size of
the particle, and the structure of the surface.
Moreover, the E criterion also requires NP catalytic systems,
if possible, to be multifunctional to integrate catalytic steps into
a one-pot, catalytic cascade process. The most signiﬁcant merits
of such a one-pot process are energy and time saving and waste
reducing, in a word, improving reaction efﬁciency. Although there
are very few examples of such efforts at present, as can be seen
in Section 4, more attention should be paid to this aspect since it
represents the future of green chemistry [7].
2.1.2. Sustainability
Sustainability is not only required by green chemistry, but also
highly desirable for the long term development of NP catalysis. Sustainability involves many considerations. For NP catalysis, there are
three factors that are of particular importance. One is the sustainability of the metal incorporated into the NP, since many metals
are becoming scarce. Rare metals are, especially, becoming rarer.
For example, platinum group elements are seen as future sources
of alternative energy as fuel cell catalysts. However, the reserves
of these elements will not fuel the world’s cars to the middle of
this century [8]. It is therefore imperative that we start on a path
towards metals that are more abundant, including the ﬁeld of NP
catalysis. The ﬁrst row of transition metals has been largely ignored
in the study of NP catalysis.
Two other factors which concern sustainability in NP catalysis
are consideration of PBT (persistence, bioaccumulation, and toxicity) [9] for both substrates (as well as products) and solvents. If any
substrate is environmentally risky, a new process that involves safe
starting materials and intermediates should be developed; this is
beyond the scope of the current review. Nevertheless, the PBT consideration is one of the key issues to judge a “green” solvent and is
discussed in Section 6.1.
2.1.3. Stability
NP is only kinetically stable and therefore stability is crucial for
real processes in which the catalysts are required to be stable for
months or years. In order to enhance the stability, stabilizers are
often employed. However, absolute NP stability is not necessarily
the aim, and what we want to do is to protect the particles against
aggregation via weak interactions between the functional group(s)
of the stabilizer and the surface sites of the particles. This protection
is enhanced via multi-site interaction, i.e. most of the surface atoms
of the particle may be involved in the weak interaction. The solvent
chosen can have two effects. The ﬁrst is interactions with the NP
surface, which can compete with the stabilizer and the second is
solubilizing the stabilizers, the regulation of which can sometimes
be helpful.
Since NP is at the lowest end of the so-called “colloidal” range
(1 nm to 1 ␮m) [10], Derjaguin–Landau–Verwey–Overbeek (DLVO)
theory [11] originally developed for the aqueous colloidal solution, is used to explain the NP stability. However, the DLVO
model fails to describe the interactions of NPs in all applicable solvent systems. Nevertheless, some general guidelines for

1181

the stability issue of NP are available and will be discussed in
Section 4.2.
2.1.4. Recyclability
It is highly probable that recyclability will be the bottleneck for
the industrial application of NP catalysis in solution phase. Good
dispersion of NP within a solvent is a double edged sword. It usually results in a catalytic system with high activity under mild
reaction conditions. Meanwhile, it makes separation of the catalyst from the product more complicate. An additional concern for
the pharmaceutical or polymer industry is metal contamination of
the products. To solve this problem, a good strategy for easy and
efﬁcient recycling has to be applied.
Although it seems to be a general trend to transform a successful homogeneous catalyst into a heterogeneous one [12], we
do not particularly recommend this strategy for NP catalyst. As
they are three-dimensional freely particles and as such possess
a high surface area and catalytic activity, which is negatively
affected by heterogeneous immobilization. As traditional solid
state catalysts have to be operated in ﬂuid bed reactors to partly
improve their two-dimensional limitation, such a strategy, i.e.
changing a three-dimensional NP into a two-dimensional heterogeneous catalyst may result in a signiﬁcant activity loss as is
often the case with immobilized (heterogenalized) complex catalysts. Other approaches to solve the recycling problem without
inﬂuencing the activity of the catalyst is still under consideration. For example, a hydroformylation process is industrialized
based on a biphasic aqueous-organic solvent system [13]. Fortunately, the experiences gained from the recycling of homogenous
catalysts during the past decades can be easily adapted to NP catalysts for the same purpose. Additionally, some features of certain
NP, which a homogenous complex does not share, such as magnetism, can enable more diversiﬁed options for the recycling of NP
catalysts.
2.2. Cohesive relationship between metal–stabilizer–solvent
An NP based catalytic system involves at least three components, i.e. metal core (M), stabilizer (S), and solvent (S). The
metal core is the catalytic material with an activity and selectivity, with the latter with assistance from the stabilizers. The
stabilizer protects the metal core against aggregation. However,
this protection may negatively affect the activity of the system. The solvent is responsible for the dispersion of both metal
core and stabilizer. However, the “solubility” of the metal core
is controlled not by the solvent, but by the stabilizer. Thus, the
solvent is the carrier transferring the reactant(s) to the metal
core and product(s) away from the active site. The solubilities of both the stabilizer and the reactant(s) in the solvent are
therefore related to the ﬁnal activity of the system. This is the
cohesive relationship among metal–stabilizer–solvent, the stateof-the-art approach to this relationship is fundamental in NP
catalysis.
In classical heterogeneous catalysis, catalyst optimization is
largely based on manipulating the active species, usually inorganic
species loaded on the support. In a homogenous catalytic system,
improvements are mostly achieved by ligand design and proper
solvent selection. In solution phase NP catalyst’s optimization can
be achieved by both approaches. On one hand, the variation of
the metal type, the control of the NP size and morphology are
effective ways for the optimization of the metal core. Also, the
magnetic properties of some NP can be used for separation purpose in catalysis. These approaches are discussed in detail in Section
3. On the other hand, the stabilizer provides another way to tune
the performance of the NP catalysis. The solid supports applied in
traditional heterogeneous catalysis are usually inorganic oxides or

carbon with much fewer variations compared to the ligand variety in homogenous catalysis. However, a wide range of organic
compounds bearing various functionalities have been used as NP
stabilizers, suggesting that stabilizers can be used to customize
the catalytic system. Indeed, an appropriate stabilizer is the key
for a stable and highly active NP catalyst. The developments, as
well as other beneﬁts, that a stabilizer may offer (such as multifunctionality) will be described in Section 4. Additionally, proper
solvent design and/or selection could prove advantageous in NP
catalysis. The most obvious beneﬁt from the solvent is that it may
simplify the separation process. For example, the biphasic approach
based on ionic liquids or water, according to the principles of green
chemistry, is desired for the separation of a catalyst from products. This, and other functions of the solvent in NP catalysis will be
discussed in Section 5.
It has to be kept in mind that metal core, stabilizer and solvent
are not isolated from each other but are acting together to make
the system effective. However, to make the story clear, we have to
discuss each of them separately as an independent section. To elucidate the detailed MSS relationship for satisfying the ESSR criteria,
a comprehensive table is given (Table 1).

3.1.1. Ti, Zr, Nb, Mn, V, Cr, Mo and W
A major advantage of these early transition metals in catalysis
is their cheap price. They exhibit weak hydrogenation ability and
sometimes can be used in hydrogenation reactions. For example,
Bönnemann et al. prepared Ti, Zr, Nb and Mn NP in THF by K[BEt3 H]
reduction from metal halide precursors [14]. They found colloidal
Ti NPs are very efﬁcient catalysts for the hydrogenation of titanium
and zirconium sponges as well as for nickel hydride battery alloy
[15].
Ti NPs have also been successfully utilized in catalyzing
McMurry coupling reaction (Scheme 1). 1,1,2,2-tetraphenylethene
was obtained from benzophenone in reﬂuxed THF with a yield
of about 80%. The main byproducts were diphenylmethanol and
1,1,2,2-tetraphenylethane. For other substrates, such as benzaldehyde and acetophenone, similar activities and selectivities were
observed [16].
Compared to the metallic state, the oxides of these early transition metals are generally paid more attention as they can effectively
catalyze many useful reactions in traditional heterogeneous catalysis. For instance, the oxides of Mn, V, Cr and Mo are extensively used
in the selective oxidation of alkanes. In the ﬁeld of photo catalysis,
TiO2 is widely recognized as an excellent catalyst that is capable
of producing H2 from water and degrading some environmental
pollutants in the presence of UV light [17]. However, there are few
reports on developing their soluble oxide NP for these reactions.
The major challenges are the lack of proper preparation strategies and the instability of these “soluble oxide NP” under reaction
conditions. The synthesis and application of oxide NP of early transition metals is comparatively a virgin area worth great efforts in
the future.

3. Roles of the transition metal
3.1. Metal type
The catalytic activity of transition metals is mainly decided by
their d orbital properties and therefore metal type selection is the
ﬁrst choice for selectivity control. Mainly according to their catalytic behavior, we divided the frequently encountered metals in
catalysis into ﬁve categories: (1) Ti, Zr, Nb, Mn, V, Cr, Mo and W;
(2) Fe, Co and Ni; (3) Cu, Ag and Au; (4) Ru, Rh, Pt and Ir; (5) Pd
(Table 2).

3.1.2. Fe, Co and Ni
Fe, Co and Ni are abundant and cheap elements, and are of great
signiﬁcance in catalysis. Recently, the potential of their metal NPs
as catalysts in quasi-homogenous mode has attracted increased
attention. The catalysts are currently applied in reactions including
hydrogenation, hydrosilation, C–C coupling and oxidation reactions.
Hydrogenation reaction has been widely studied. Herein, just
a few representative examples will be mentioned. Martino et al.
prepared Fe NP by reducing iron ions with LiBH4 in reverse micelle

solutions. These Fe NPs were active catalysts in the hydrogenolysis of naphthyl bibenzyl methane [18]. Ni NPs with a size of about
45 nm were prepared from Ni(CH3 COO)2 via hydrazine reduction
in solvothermal process, which exhibit excellent activity and selectivity in the hydrogenation of nitrobenzene [19]. The Ni NPs were
also synthesized in IL phase through the decomposition of [bis(1,5cyclooctadiene)nickel(0)] organometallic precursor. When applied
in cyclohexene hydrogenation, the NPs exhibit two orders of magnitude higher activities than traditional heterogeneous Ni-based
catalyst [20]. For Co NPs, Mertens et al. examined their catalytic
property in the selective hydrogenation of ␣,␤-unsaturated aldehydes, obtaining a selectivity ranging from 70% to 90% [21].
The hydrogenation reaction of carbon monoxide to produce
alkanes, known as Fischer–Tropsch (F–T) reaction, is very attractive due to its great potential in the transport fuel production in
the post-petroleum era. Co and Fe based catalysts are frequently
used in industry. Recently, Co NP catalyzed F–T reaction has been
demonstrated to be quite active in IL by Scariot et al. [22] and in
squalane by our group. The observed activity is of the same order
of magnitude as that of supported Co catalysts. In an attempt to
use Fe NP for the F–T reactions in glycerol, we found that Fe NP catalyzed the formation of dioxolane derivatives as the main products.
This novel reaction was thought to undergo the mechanism listed
in Scheme 2 [23].
Hydrosilation is a reaction of signiﬁcance for the synthesis of silica incorporated polymers. A representative reaction is formulated
in Scheme 3. This reaction had long been regarded as catalyzed
by homogenous complexes. However, recent advances lead to the
conclusion that in some cases, Co and Ni NP formed in situ from
their complex precursors in the presence of reductive silane in the
induction period, may be responsible for the catalytic activity [24].
In addition, Ni NP can be used in C–C coupling reactions. Reetz
et al. synthesized tetradodecylammonium bromide protected Ni
NP via electrochemical method [25], which was further utilized in

Scheme 4. The [3+2] cyclo-addition reaction catalyzed by Ni nanoparticles [25].

the [3+2] cyclo-addition reaction between methylenecyclopropane
and methyl acrylate (Scheme 4). However, compared to the classical catalyst for this reaction, Ni(COD)2 , the activity of the Ni NP is
much lower.
Fe, Co and Ni based catalysts are widely used in oxidation reactions in industry. A simple example is the production of adipic
acid, an indispensible intermediate compound for the synthesis
of nylon-6 and nylon-66 from the oxidation of cyclohexane via
Co-based catalyst (Scheme 5). On the contrary, Fe, Co or Ni based
soluble NPs under quasi-homogenous mode for oxidation reactions
are seldom reported. The only available report came from Patin et
al., who found that Fe NP prepared by reverse microemulsion can
catalyze the oxidation of cyclooctane with acceptable activity under
mild conditions [26].
To conclude, Fe, Co and Ni NPs are widely investigated in many
kinds of reactions. Being paid much attention, these NP promises a
lot for the catalytic reactions in solution phase in the future.
3.1.3. Cu, Ag and Au
These metals are usually used for redox reactions. For example,
Vukojevic et al. found that Cu NPs synthesized by the reduction of
copper acetylacetonate with trialkylaluminum in THF were highly
active in methanol synthesis [27]. The copper particle has a narrow size distribution, and the size can be tuned in the range of
3–5 nm. When applied to methanol synthesis, the Cu NP exhibited notable activity at temperatures above 130 ◦ C. Under similar
reaction conditions, their catalytic activity was comparable to that
of commercialized Cu/ZnO catalyst. The author claimed that Cu
NPs are remarkably active catalysts in the quasi-homogeneous
phase for methanol synthesis, considering that traditional catalyst

Scheme 6. Production of methyl formate from methanol carbonylation catalyzed
by Cu nanoparticles [29].

requires a second component, generally zinc, to be active. However,
this conclusion may not be convincing since it is highly possible
that the Cu NP incorporated with Al during the reduction process,
as suggested by other researchers [28].
In industry, methyl formate (MF) is produced from methanol
by carbonylation reaction catalyzed by a strong base such as
CH3 ONa which is highly efﬁcient but obviously not green. It leads
to inevitable problems such as corrosion, byproduct formation
and the possible deactivation of catalyst by CO2 and H2 O impurities. We recently discovered the Cu NP catalyzed synthesis of
MF in the absence of any base [29]. Three nanometer Cu NP prepared from NaBH4 reduction in methanol exhibited an activity of
1.0–16.8 mol MF mol Cu−1 h−1 and a selectivity of 100% towards MF
formation (Scheme 6). Further advances in improving MF productivity will potentially lead to a green substitute for the current
industrial process that requires environmental unfriendly alkaline
metal alkoxides as catalysts.
Ag NPs are mainly used in oxidation/dehydrogenation reactions.
Ag catalyzed epoxidation reaction is well known and widely applied
in ethylene oxide production. Soluble Ag NPs in ethanol/water mixture are superior catalysts relative to a conventional heterogeneous
Ag catalyst (Scheme 7) [30]. The authors also found that the addition of Cs(I) and Re(VII) metal ions greatly enhanced the catalytic
activities.
Research concerning the catalytic properties of Au NP is also
focused on oxidation reactions. Current applications include oxidation of carbon monoxide into carbon dioxide and glucose into
gluconic acid [31]. Au and Ag NP can also effectively decompose
NaBH4 , a potential hydrogen storage material, into H2 and NaBO2
[32,33].
3.1.4. Ru, Rh, Pt and Ir
These noble metals are typical catalysts with excellent hydrogenation ability. For the hydrogenation of C C bonds, the activity
of their metal NPs usually follows the trend of Rh > Ru > Pt > Ir. This
trend is similar to that observed in traditional heterogeneous catalysis. The hydrogenation of C C bonds using these soluble NPs is
comparatively easy and there are numerous studies on this topic.
Detailed information can be found in pertinent reviews [34]. Hydrogenation of the benzene ring is a much more challenging task and
this reaction received increased attention recently. Rh and Ru are
the most active metals towards benzene hydrogenation. Rh is generally more active but Ru is much cheaper. The ﬁrst example dates
back to 1983 when Januszkiewicz et al. used Ru NP for the reaction [35]. Research focus is on the development of more stable and
active NP. Until now, the record of the turn over numbers (TTO) on
benzene hydrogenation is 20,000, which is attractive for practical
applications [36].
For the hydrogenation of C O bonds, Ir, Pt and Ru exhibit excellent activity. Özkar and Finke prepared Ir NPs and used them for the
hydrogenation of acetones [37]. The reaction progresses effectively
under ambient temperatures, with a selectivity of about 95% for 2-

Scheme 8. Selective hydrogenation of acetone catalyzed by Ir nanoparticles [37].

hydroxyl propanol and a TTO of 16,400 (Scheme 8). The authors
pointed out that the typical temperature applied for this reaction
under traditional supported catalyst is much higher, between 100
and 300 ◦ C.
When both C C and C O are present, a selectivity issue arises.
It is easier for the C C bond than the C O bond to undergo hydrogenation. Unfortunately, in many applications selective reduction
of only the C O bond is desired, for example, cinnamaldehyde
hydrogenation (Scheme 9). Pt and Ru NPs are frequently used for
the selective hydrogenation of the C O bond. Pt is more active
and Ru generally exhibits better selectivity. Yu et al. found that
for the reduction of cinnamaldehyde, the addition of some metal
ions such as Fe3+ , Co2+ and Ni2+ can greatly enhance the selectivity
of the aimed unsaturated alcohol product, which may be due to the
induction effect of these ions that can activate C O bonds [38]. Our
group demonstrated that selectivity control of this reaction can also
be manipulated by solvent design, which is discussed in details in
Section 5.
Ru NP can catalyze the hydrogenation of glucose to sorbitol.
Notably, we discovered that they can catalyze direct hydrogenolysis of cellubiose into polyols, which opens up a new route for the
utilization of cellulose. Ru/C catalyst did not exhibit such activity
under the same conditions [39].
Furthermore, we found that unsupported Ru NP catalyst is more
active than conventional catalysts for Fischer–Tropsch synthesis
in water. A 35-fold increase in activity was observed for unsupported Ru NP at 150 ◦ C. Note worthily, the hydrocarbon product
is immiscible with water, so the fuel can be separated easily from
the catalyst, which facilitates the working up process and is more
energy efﬁcient for the production of fuels [40].
Reduction of N O into NH2 group is essential for producing
some intermediates in dye manufacture. Similar to the reduction
of C O, the best catalysts for the N O reduction are Ru and Pt NPs.
Again, Pt exhibits higher activity whereas Ru is more selective [41].
As dye molecules generally contain halogen atoms, dehalogenation
becomes the main side reaction. Adding metal ions can signiﬁcantly
improve the selectivity. The reason was proposed that the interaction between N O and the metal ions can weaken the N O bond
strength [42].
Pt NPs are efﬁcient catalyst for hydrosilylation reaction. Generally, Pt organometallic complexes were used for this reaction.
However, through TEM analysis, Lewis et al. found the presence
of Pt NPs which were the real catalysts for the reaction. These Pt
NPs were formed in situ from the organometallic precursors by the
reduction of silanes [43].
Oxidation reactions using these NPs as catalysts have also been
reported. For example, our group prepared a soluble Pt NP in glycol, which displays good performance in the oxidation of both
activated and non-activated alcohols including a wide range of

aromatic alcohols, allylic alcohols, alicyclic alcohols, and primary
and secondary aliphatic alcohols in water under aerobic conditions
without using any bases [44]. Ru NP can also be utilized in oxidation reactions and under water/cyclooctene biphasic conditions,
cyclohexane can be converted into cyclooctanone and cyclooctanol
under mild conditions (Scheme 10) [45].
3.1.5. Pd
Pd has excellent catalytic activity toward hydrogenation/dehydrogenation. Furthermore, it is highly effective for
many C–C coupling reactions. These features make the role of Pd
in catalysis unique.
The most intriguing aspect of Pd in hydrogenation reactions
is its unique selectivity. It is well known that Pd can selectively
catalyze the hydrogenation of alkynes and diene compounds into
alkenes. For example, Hirai et al. reported that PVP stabilized Pd
NP can catalyze the production of cyclopentene and cyclooctene
from cyclopenta-1,3-diene and cycloocta-1,5-diene, respectively
[46]. Kinetic study of a series of cyclooctadiene revealed that the
reaction rate follows the order of cycloocta-1,3-diene > cycloocta1,4-diene > cycloocta-1,5-diene, indicating that the conjugated
1,3-diene is the intermediate for the hydrogenation of dienes into
monoenes.
Pd NP can also be applied in dehydrogenation. The dehydroaromatization of limonene to p-cymene, a compound of great
commercial interest, under hydrogen atmosphere (Scheme 11)
comprises a relatively complex series of reactions. Our group estab-

lished a biphasic dehydroaromatization of limonene, a renewable
biomass material, into p-cymene using soluble Pd NP catalysts
in aqueous solution in the presence of hydrogen under severe
conditions (>150 ◦ C), achieving a conversion of 93% and a selectivity of 82% [47]. A plausible reaction pathway involving initial
isomerization followed by dehydrogenation was illustrated in
Scheme 11.
The ﬁrst Pd NP catalyzed Heck reaction was reported by Beller
et al. [48]. They prepared tetraoctylammonium bromide protected
Pd NP which can catalyze the Heck type cross coupling reaction
between ethyl acrylate and benzyl halides, as demonstrated in
Scheme 12. Pd NP catalyzed Heck reaction was also studied respectively by Reetz et al. [49], Antonietti et al. [50] and Bradley et al.
[51] with different approaches. Generally, the Pd NP can effectively
catalyze activated substrates.
Tetraalkylammonium bromide protected Pd NPs are also effective in catalyzing Suzuki cross-coupling reactions. Reetz et al.
investigated the Suzuki cross-coupling reactions catalyzed by
tetrabutylammonium bromide-Pd NP, which was prepared via
electrochemical methods and dispersed in DMA (Scheme 13) [49].
Pd NP can convert bromide and iodide substrate much faster when
electron withdrawing group is present in the benzene ring of the
substrate. Dendrimer protected Pd NP for Suzuki reactions were
studied by Narayanan and El-Sayed [52]. The Pd NP underwent
aggregation under the reaction conditions. The authors believed
the aggregation was due to the unreduced Pd precursor left in the
preparation process.

Scheme 13. Suzuki reaction catalyzed by Pd nanoparticles [49].

There are also reports of Pd NP catalyzed Stille, Sonogashira and
Hiyama reactions. It is interesting to note that a common drawback
with these Pd NPs is that they are only active for reactive substrates
like benzyl bromide and benzyl iodide. For the more economically
attractive and more challenging benzyl chloride substrate, successful examples are extremely rare.
3.1.6. Bimetallic NP
Bimetallic NPs, composed of two different metal elements, are
of greater interest in some aspects than monometallic ones for the
improvement of catalytic properties. This is because bimetallization can improve catalytic properties of the original single-metal
catalysts and create new properties. Bimetallic catalysis is in fact
a very old concept in heterogeneous catalysis, as developed by
Sinfelt in 1980s [53]. Bimetallic NP in solvent can be regarded
as an extension of these efforts made with different synthesis
approaches which was pioneered by Harada et al. who conducted a
series of work on PVP stabilized bimetallic NP [54]. Current strategies for the preparation of bimetallic NP include co-reduction of
mixed ions, successive reduction, reduction of double complexes
and electrochemical approaches [55]. The effects of the added
metal component can often be explained in terms of an ensemble and/or a ligand effect in catalysis [56,57] or in terms of more
recent approaches such as electron transfer between the components [58]. At present various examples demonstrated the use of
bimetallic NP with Pt–Fe [59], Au–Fe [60], Pd–Au [61], Cu–Au [62],
Pd–Pt [63], and Pd–Ni [47] being the most representative. Recently
an extreme example comes from Schroter et al. who found that
Cu-ZnO NPs are highly active in methanol synthesis whereas Cu
NPs alone are completely inactive (see Scheme 14) [64]. The current review will not go to more detailed discussion because of two
reasons: (1) there is no fundamental difference between bimetallic NP in dispersion and classical heterogeneous catalysis and the
latter has been extensively investigated; (2) there are several other
recent reviews dealing with this subject [65].
Finally, although this review focused on NP catalysis in solvents,
the general trends discussed here are well suited for nanocatalysis
of other branches since they illustrate intrinsic catalytic properties
of the metals.
3.2. Nanoparticle size
Diameter is an important parameter which can be taken advantage of for the modiﬁcation of the catalytic properties of the NP.
The most obvious size-dependence relationship comes from the
change in the percentage of surface atoms which are responsible
for the catalytic properties when changing the diameter. However,

the true story is not that simple as many variables inﬂuence the
relationship between the diameter of NP and the catalytic performance. Because of limited space and the availability of previous
more speciﬁc reviews [52,66], we will limit our discussion to the
cases of NP catalysis in solvents by providing most representative
examples.
Gold is probably the most frequently studied metal for its size
dependent catalytic properties. Following Haruta’s discovery of CO
oxidation catalyzed by supported Au NP [67], the literature has
been inundated with reports on gold-catalyzed oxidation reactions. Valden and co-workers described an inspiring result on
size-selective catalysis by using a model Au/TiO2 catalyst [68].
After that, numerous studies demonstrated the size dependence
of the gold NP in carbon monoxide oxidation [69], alcohol oxidation [70], and propylene epoxidation reactions [71]. Besides, size
dependences were also observed in various reduction reactions
[72]. However, for supported heterogeneous catalysis, the particle
size effect is not very well understood mainly due to the complexity
of the interactions between the gold NP and the support. To avoid
this, Tsukuda et al. studied the aerobic oxidation of benzylic alcohols catalyzed by monodisperse gold NP stabilized by PVP with a
focus on the particle size effect on catalysis [73]. By using seeded
growth method, Au NPs with diameters from 1.3 to 10 nm were
obtained. The resulting Au NP exhibited signiﬁcant difference in
the oxidation of benzylic alcohols, with a sharp increase in activity when the diameter decreased to below 2.5 nm. Kinetic analysis
rationalized such difference in catalytic activity to be the easier
activation of oxygen by the smaller Au NP.
On many occasions, there seems to be a “threshold diameter” below which considerable catalytic activity is observed.
Exhaustive experimental and theoretical studies were conducted to
understand such phenomena and current explanations are mainly
focused on quantum size effects and low-coordination numbers
(support effects are excluded) [74]. For example, Valden et al. prepared gold clusters ranging in diameter from 1 to 6 nm on single
crystalline surfaces of titania in ultrahigh vacuum. With scanning
tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS) and kinetics measurements of elevated pressure reaction, they observed that a
metal-to-insulator transition occurs as the particle size falls below
3.5 nm in diameter, coinciding with the speciﬁc activity of the
model and high-area Au/TiO2 catalysts [75]. Lopez and Nørskov carried out density-functional-theory (DFT) studies on the reactivity
of both oxide-supported and isolated Au NP towards CO oxidation [76]. The results showed that the high concentration of Au
atoms with low coordination number is the dominant factor in the
catalytic activity of Au NP. If we take both electronic structural differences and geometrical conﬁgurations into account, we can make

Scheme 14. Preparation of Cu and Cu–ZnO nanoparticles in squalane [65].

N. Yan et al. / Coordination Chemistry Reviews 254 (2010) 1179–1218

a plausible explanation of the remarkable difference in catalytic
activity observed between small Au clusters and large Au crystals
[77].
The interplay of diameter and the catalytic activity of Pd NP has
also been widely investigated. Pd NPs of different sizes (3–7 nm)
were prepared by Boone and El-Sayed and used for Suzuki reactions. The general trend observed is that the catalytic activity of
Pd NP increases as the particle size decreases, which also suggests
that the low-coordination-number atoms (vertex and edge atoms)
on the surface are responsible for the catalysis. However, the catalytic activity of the smallest Pd NP is the lowest. The authors
attributed this irregularity to the strong adsorption of the intermediates on the Pd NP surface which act as a poison of the reaction
[78]. Following this strategy, Trzeciak and co-workers prepared a
series of Pd NPs with wider size distribution (1.9–19.8 nm). Not
surprisingly, they found that in most cases higher yields of benzoic
acid methyl ester were obtained when smaller Pd NPs were used in
the methoxycarbonylation of iodobenzene. However, as these Pd
NPs were obtained by using three different reductants including
pyrogallol, chromium(II) acetate, and hydrazine, the observed difference in catalytic activity may not simply be caused by the size
effect [79]. Heck reaction catalyzed by the Pd NPs with difference in
size was also studied by Gniewek et al. Again, smaller NP displays
higher activity [80].
Hirai et al. prepared Pd NPs with average diameters between
1.8 and 2.3 nm by reducing palladium(II) chloride with reﬂuxing
methanol in the presence of poly(N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone), and studied their effect in the selective hydrogenation of cyclopentadiene or
cyclooctadiene to form mononenes [81]. Pd NPs led to considerably
higher yield (97.8%) than 5 wt% Pd/C catalyst (94.3%) in the hydrogenation of 1,5-cyclooctadiene. The selectivity of oleﬁn increases
with the decrease of the Pd NP size.
Semagina et al. prepared monodispersed Pd NPs of 6, 8, 11 and
13 nm in diameter by reverse microemulsion, and studied their performance in solvent-free hydrogenation of 2-methyl-3-butyn-2-ol
to 2-methyl-3-buten-2-ol. A novel method, hydrocarbon evaporation and methanol-assisted particle puriﬁcation, was developed to
obtain pure monodispersed metal NP for size effect studies, avoiding other effects such as those of solvents and surfactants. The initial
activity calculated per mole of surface palladium atoms was doubled when particle size increased from 6 to 13 nm, but it remained
constant with the size change for a ﬁxed number of speciﬁc Pd
atoms on Pd (1 1 1) facets. The author claimed that the Pd size controlled the reaction rate as well as byproduct distribution in this
model reaction. No dependence of selectivity for oleﬁnic alcohol
on particle size was observed [82].
Recently, Glöckler et al. prepared Rh NPs with very narrow size
distribution (2–6 nm). The Rh NPs show high activity in the biphasic
hydrogenation of oleﬁns and are able to catalyze the hydrogenation of aromatic compounds. Again, the results show that under the
same conditions small clusters exhibit signiﬁcantly higher catalytic
activity than large ones [83].
We synthesized Ru NPs with diameters ranging from 1.7 to
4.0 nm and found that the diameter of the Ru NPs had a signiﬁcant
effect on their catalytic activity in Fischer–Tropsch reaction in aqueous phase [84]. The surface-speciﬁc activity decreased gradually as
the size of the NPs reduced from 4.0 to 2.5 nm. Then the activity
increased dramatically resulting in an unprecedented maximum
TOF value of 12.9 h−1 at 150 ◦ C when the diameter of NP reached
2.0 nm, which is seven times higher than the activity obtained for
previous heterogenous catalyst at 200 ◦ C. Finally it decreased significantly with the NP diameter decreasing (Fig. 2). This phenomenon
is very similar to that found in ammonia synthesis catalyzed by
Ru NP, in which a smaller optimal ruthenium size was observed
[85]. Based on single crystal studies and DFT calculations [86], Dahl
suggested that B5 sites involving edge atoms are primarily respon-

sible for the catalytic activity of Ru NP during ammonia synthesis.
From the analysis of FCC cubo-octahedron model, B5 sites are only
present on particles with a size larger than ca. 1.5 nm. The maximum probability of B5 sites was found for particles with diameters
of 1.8–2.5 nm and for particles larger than that, the probability of
B5 sites monotonically decreased. This explanation may also be
suitable for the special catalytic activity observed in F–T synthesis.
It is noteworthy that in the study of the size effect of NP on its
catalysis, other parameters have to be kept constant, which seems
obvious but sometimes was ignored. For example when researchers
are focused on the size effects of NP and a series of NPs with different sizes are obtained, particular attention has to be paid to the
morphology consistency of these NPs, even if they are prepared in
similar ways. José-Yacamán et al. reported the synthesis of Pd NP
protected by [CH3 (CH2 )11 SH] and reduced by [LiB(C2 H5 )3 H] from
PdCl2 . For a single batch of preparation, Pd NPs with FCC cubooctahedra, icosahedra, truncated decahedra and single-twinned
FCC conﬁgurations are all present as identiﬁed by HRTEM [87].
3.3. Nanoparticle morphology
Shape is another signiﬁcant factor that inﬂuences the catalytic
activity of NP. Different shapes bring surface sites with different coordination structures and electronic properties which are
responsible for the catalytic process. Strategies for preparation and
characterization of NPs with different shapes have been extensively
investigated and detailed introduction can be found elsewhere [88].
The shape dependence of NP catalytic activity in solution phase,
which is of interest here, was pioneered by Ahmadi et al. who
synthesized Pt NPs with different morphologies [89]. Tetrahedral,
cubic, and spherical Pt NPs were obtained by different combinations
of stabilizers and reduction methods. These Pt NPs were applied for
the electron transfer reaction between hexacyanoferrate (III) ions
and thiosulfate ions. The activation energies and the average rate
constants are determined at the early stage of the reaction to avoid
any potential shape change of NP. The activation energy follows
the order of cubic NP > spherically NP > tetrahedral NP and the rate
constant follows the opponent trend of tetrahedral NP > spherically
NP > cubic NP. A calculation based on simpliﬁed models indicated
that these kinetic parameters are correlated with the fraction of surface atoms located on the corners and edges in each shape, which
conﬁrmed that for NPs of different shapes, the larger percentage
of edge and corner atoms they have, the more active they are [90].
Different reactions give different responses according to the morphology change of catalyst [91]. For Suzuki reaction, tetrahedral
Pt NPs are almost 1/3 as active as classical Pd NP catalysts in coupling boronic acid and iodobenzene, whereas spherical Pt NPs are
completely inactive [92]. In this occasion, the difference in catalytic

1188

Scheme 15. The methoxycarbonylation reaction catalyzed by Pd nanoparticles [94].

activity cannot be simply explained by the percentage of the edge
and corner atoms, and the electronic difference of the surface atoms
for each shape has to be taken into account.
Following this synthesis strategy, Gniewek and co-workers
recently prepared PVP-stabilized Pd NPs with different shapes by
selecting reducing reagents [93]. The morphology effects of Pd NP in
methoxycarbonylation were evaluated in the reaction of iodobenzene, carbon monoxide and methanol (see Scheme 15). An increase
in catalytic activity was observed when the fraction of surface
atoms in the corners and edges increases.
Xiao et al. recently reported a strong dependence of the activity of Pd nanocatalyst on its morphology for the oxygen reduction
reaction (ORR) [94]. Theoretical approaches for explaining the relationship between the shape and activity of NP have also been used.
The surface-speciﬁc activity of Pd nanorods toward the ORR was
10-fold higher than that of Pd NP. By density functional theory calculations, they found the adsorption energy of O adsorption on Pd
(1 1 0) facets (main exposed facets of Pd nanorods) is signiﬁcantly
lower than that on Pd(1 0 0) facets (main exposed facets of Pd NP).
Based on the general strategy to improve the catalytic activity by
decreasing the adsorption energy of O adsorption to an appropriate degree [95], it was concluded that the superior activity of Pd
nanorods toward the ORR most likely arises from the morphology
peculiarity of the exposed Pd(1 1 0) facets at the side surface.
Interestingly, the shape of NP in one reaction sometimes is not
unchanged. The electron-transfer reaction between hexacyanoferrate (III) and thiosulfate ions catalyzed by Pt NPs with two shapes
(tetrahedral and cubic) was studied by HRTEM [96]. During recycling, extensive dissolution of platinum atoms from the corners and
edges for both types of NPs was observed. The rate for the disappearing (dissolution) of the surface Pt atoms is bigger for the
tetrahedral NP than for the cubic NP, which suggests that NPs with
sharp corners and edges, such as the tetrahedral NPs, are easier to
undergo shape changes during catalytic process.
3.4. Magnetic properties of some nanoparticles
Magnetic NPs in general are of great interest today with a wide
application potential in biochemistry, smart material and catalysis
[97]. For catalysis, magnetic properties provide a unique way for
catalyst separation and recycling and have been paid great attention to for a long time. One signiﬁcant example is the magnetically
stabilized bed reactor in which catalysts were loaded on magnetic
materials and the reactor was handled under an intensive controllable magnetic ﬁeld [98]. In the domain of NP catalysis, reports
about the utilization of magnetic NP can be divided into two main
categories: (a) magnetic NP as catalyst and (b) magnetic NP as the
carrier for the real catalyst. Both approaches will be introduced in
the following section.
Iron, cobalt and nickel are intrinsically catalytically active for
some reactions. NPs of these metals and metal oxides are efﬁcient
and recyclable catalysts. For example, Ni NPs have been synthesized
by the hydrazine reduction of nickel chloride in ethylene glycol at
60 ◦ C with diameters ranging from 10 to 12 nm. The Ni NPs can be
used to catalyze the decomposition of hydrazine into hydrogen and

nitrogen gases at room temperature. Notably, the Ni NPs could be
magnetically recovered and redispersed in ethylene glycol without agglomeration or size change [99]. Similarly, Fe NPs obtained
through a simple reduction of FeSO4 with NaBH4 were applied for
H2 production from NH3 BH3 . These Fe NPs were very stable, even
in the presence of air and water, and easy to recover [100].
Oxide NPs based on Fe and Co have also been reported. Beller et
al. prepared Fe2 O3 NPs which were highly stable, active, and highly
selective for various oxidation reactions using hydrogen peroxide.
The high recyclability of these Fe2 O3 NPs has also been demonstrated, indicating they are well suited for continuous processes
[101].
Unfortunately, magnetic properties belong to a few metals and
their oxides that are only catalytically active in limited reactions.
To take full advantages of the magnetic properties for separation
purpose, there are continuous interests in integrating different
functional nanocomponents into one single nanoentity to exhibit
multifunctional properties [102]. Speciﬁcally, combining magnetic
NP with other catalytically active moieties can obtain an easily recyclable catalyst that is active for certain reaction. Reported hybrid
magnetic NPs usually have a core/shell structure, consisting of a
magnetic iron oxide core surrounded by a layer of organic shell
[103]. The organic shells prevent magnetic cores from aggregation
and offer an interface for immobilization of catalysts. Various methods can be used for the preparation of hybrid magnetic NP as shown
below.
3-Aminopropyl triethoxysilane (APTS) is one of the frequently
used modiﬁcation reagents for Fe2 O3 to form multicomponent
nanocomposites. It reacts with hydroxyl groups on the surface of
Fe2 O3 to form covalently bonded silane moiety that can be further
functionalized. By such a protocol, Wang et al. reported the preparation of Pd–Fe2 O3 NP. The catalytic behavior of Pd–Fe3 O4 NP was
measured toward the Heck cross-coupling reaction between acrylic
acid and iodobenzene. Although the catalyst is recyclable under
external magnetic ﬁeld, the activity underwent a gradual and continued decrease upon recycling. The author attributed this to the
aggregation of Pd NP in the recycling process [104].
In 2007, Hyeon and co-workers reported a new magnetically
recyclable and efﬁcient NP catalyst for the epoxidation of oleﬁns,
which was based on molybdenum oxide NP incorporated with magnetite NP. Despite of the fact that very large Fe2 O3 NPs were applied
(400 nm), the resulting hybrid NPs exhibited well dispersion in the
solvents [105]. Following this strategy, Shylesh et al. developed
similar Mo–Fe2 O3 NP for epoxidation reaction, with similar activity
and recyclability [106].
Very recently, Ru–Fe2 O3 NPs were developed for catalyzing the
coupling between sulfonamides and alcohols. The underlying C–N
bond formation reaction takes place with high selectivity giving
only water as side product. Again, the catalyst is easily isolated and
reused because of its magnetic property [107].
Homogenous catalysts could also be attached to magnetic NP
for recycling. Generally, a nanocomposite that bears a magnetic
core with homogenous complex anchored to its surface was used.
Stevens et al. reported the use of super paramagnetic NP as matrices for supporting catalysts for homogeneous Suzuki, Heck and
Sonogashira cross-coupling reactions [108]. The complexes of Pd
and N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) were coated on Fe2 O3 cores to
form iron oxide-Pd. These nanocomposites, due to their very small
dimensions (11 nm) and organic coatings could partially dissolve in
organic solvents. The superparamagnetism of the Fe2 O3 core allows
the catalyst to be magnetically concentrated and re-dispersed without forming permanent magnetized clumps in the reaction media.
No signiﬁcant loss of the catalytic activity of the immobilized catalyst was observed after several reaction cycles. For better dispersion
of the Fe2 O3 NP, the same group reported later an “emulsion polymerization” method to form a highly branched polymer of styrene

N. Yan et al. / Coordination Chemistry Reviews 254 (2010) 1179–1218

and 1,4-divinylbenzene, which leads to NPs with narrower size
distribution and therefore higher stability [109]. Similarly, magnetically recoverable NPs bearing chiral catalysts were prepared and
used for asymmetric hydrogenation of aromatic ketones [110].
Abu-Reziq et al. grafted PAMAM dendrimers onto the Fe2 O3 NP.
After modiﬁcation of Fe2 O3 NP with APTS, G2 dendrimers were prepared by the classical stepwise method. The resulting dendronized
magnetic NPs were used to support [Rh(COD)Cl]2 for the hydroformylation reactions. The reactivity and selectivity of the catalyst
were very high, in addition to its facial and complete recover under
magnetic ﬁeld [111].
Other synthesis strategies, such as click chemistry [112], were
also reported for the preparation of magnetic and multifunctional
NP. Furthermore, magnetic NPs found their application in classical non-metal organic catalytic reactions. For example, an acylation
catalyst, 4-N,N-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) was grafted on the
silica modiﬁed Fe2 O3 NP, which gave birth to the ﬁrst DMAP–Fe2 O3
NP as a robust heterogeneous nucleophilic catalyst [113]. Later
on, chiral DMAP–Fe2 O3 NPs for enantioselective acylation were
reported by the same group [114].
4. Role of the stabilizer
4.1. Stabilizers in green solvents
4.1.1. Typical stabilizers that are used in water
Water is among the most polar solvents in the polarity scale
of common solvents. A common feature of the stabilizers that are
used in aqueous phase is their high polarity, as indicated by their
molecular structure in Fig. 3. The oldest NP stabilizer in water is
trisodium citrate (3), which is actually a multi-carboxyl acid with
a hydroxyl group at C-2 position. The carboxyl group can provide
coordination to the NPs and thereby the NPs are stabilized. Furthermore, the hydroxyl group in the molecular provides additional
protection for the NP. In fact, carboxyl group or hydroxyl group
alone can provide sufﬁcient stabilization to the NP. Mono-carboxyl
acids, (like acetate 4), dicarboxyl acids (like succinate 11), poly
hydroxyl alcohols (like ethylene glycol 8) and sugars (for example carboxymethyl cellulose 16) all are efﬁcient stabilizers for NP.
Tetraalkyl ammonia salts represent another category of widely
used stabilizers, with tetrabutyl amine bromide (7) and trimethylhexadecan aminium bromide (6) being the most representative.
Their stabilization towards the NP is mainly due to the formation of electrostatic double layers. Surfactants that form micelles
in water, such as sodium dodecyl sulfate 12 and some water soluble ligands containing N or P atoms (4-Dimethylaminopyridine
13, phosphinophosphonic acids 20), can also be used as stabilizers. Dendrimers can behave as molecular boxes that entrap and
stabilize NP especially if there are heteroatoms (N, S) in the dendrimer’s interiors [115]. Various dendrimers are applied in water
as NP stabilizer, as can be seen in Fig. 3. Some stabilizers can
provide combined effects to protect the NP, which are usually
more effective. For example, poly(2-aminothiophenol) 2, polyethylene glycol 9 and polyaniline 10 have combinations of steric and
coordination properties, whereas poly(diallyldimethylammonium
chloride) 27 provides a combination of steric and electrostatic
protections.
4.1.2. Typical stabilizers that are used in ILs
The most widely applied stabilizers in ILs are in fact ILs themselves, especially for the case of imidazolium based ILs, since
they provide both hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions [116].
Migowski and Dupont are the ﬁrst to recognize the potential of
these imidazolium based ILs in the preparation of NP. Until now,
the utility of imidazolium ILs as a stabilizer and immobilizing

1189

agent for NP catalyst has been convincingly demonstrated [117].
However, in some cases agglomeration still happens, leading to
a loss of activity during recycling. This suggests that ILs alone
have limitations in stabilizing NP, especially under harsh reaction
conditions.
Combination of ILs with another stabilizer or functionalization
of ILs could provide additional beneﬁt, making NP more stable.
In our group, we ﬁrst tested the combination of PVP and ILs, but
obtained limited success. PVP and [Bmim]PF6 co-protected metal
NPs, including Ag, Rh, Pd and Pt were synthesized and used as catalyst in oleﬁn hydrogenation reaction. However, due to the poor
solubility of PVP in ILs, the NPs only exhibit moderate activity
and stability in the reaction. This promoted our further studies
to overcome the problem. Two strategies were developed. One is
to synthesize ionic copolymers that contain both PVP and imidazolium ion units, which can act as soluble bifunctional co-stabilizers
when applied in ILs [118]. The copolymer was synthesized through
the free radical polymerization of N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone and 1vinyl-3-alkyl imidazolium halide, with the later prepared by the
reaction between 1-vinyl imidazolium and alkyl halide. Then Rh
NPs with a narrow unimodal size distribution centered at 3 nm
were prepared by the reduction of RhCl3 and stabilized by the
co-polymer in IL phase, which were highly active and stable in
hydrogenation of benzene under comparatively forcing conditions,
with a TOF about 250 h−1 . TEM analysis and mercury test veriﬁed
the heterogeneous nature of the reaction. During recycling, no visible agglomeration of the NP was observed, and the catalyst could
be reused without loss of activity, leading to an unprecedented lifetime (TTO > 20,000). The other strategy is to design new ILs that
can dissolve PVP, which has recently been realized under collaboration with Prof. Dyson in EPFL [119]. Since PVP is highly soluble
in water and alcohol, it is not surprising that PVP is readily soluble in [HOC2 MIm]BF4 (>5%) and completely insoluble in [Emim]BF4 .
The direct combination of hydroxyl-functionalized ILs (OH-ILs) and
PVP formed a media for the stabilization of highly active and stable NP. Rh again was selected and Rh–OH-IL–PVP was prepared
through classical ethanol reduction of Rh salts in the presence of
PVP followed by immobilization of Rh–PVP into OH–ILs. In the
hydrogenation reaction of styrene, these Rh NPs exhibited excellent
catalytic performance under mild conditions, and the products can
be easily isolated from the catalytic system by decantation without contamination from either the IL or the metal nanocatalyst.
One of the most appealing features of this system is that it enables
the direct use of PVP, which is a cheap, commercially available and
powerful stabilizer for NP in IL phase. Other stabilizers, such as various pyridine based ligands, are also used in combination with ILs
to protect the NP.
On the other hand, ILs can be tuned with enhanced stabilization
ability. Zhao et al. developed a series of functionalized ILs bearing
nitrile, ether and hydroxyl groups that provided weak coordination to the NP when used as stabilizers resulting in better catalytic
performance in C–C coupling reactions such as Suzuki, Stille and
Heck reactions [120]. Reported stabilizers that are effective in ILs
are provided in Fig. 4.
4.1.3. Typical stabilizers that are used in ﬂuorous solvents and
carbon dioxide
The stabilizers used in ﬂuorous solvents and carbon dioxide are
very special. For both solvents, in order to increase the compatibility of catalyst to the solvents, it is necessary to modify the stabilizer
by introducing a ﬂuorous moiety. For ﬂuorous solvents the application of ﬂuorous containing stabilizer makes a “like-dissolve-like”
effect to the NP, leading to soluble NP in the ﬂuorous solvents.
In the case of scCO2 , conventional surfactants themselves could
not form reverse micelles or microemulsions in it because the van
der Waals interdroplet attractions are too high. To overcome this

1190

N. Yan et al. / Coordination Chemistry Reviews 254 (2010) 1179–1218

problem, surfactants or cosurfactants with ﬂuorinated tails were
applied as NP stabilizer, which provides a layer of weak attractive
compound covering the highly attractive droplet cores and thus
prevents the short-range interactions that are detrimental to the
stability of the system. Therefore, ligands and surfactants contain-

ing ﬂuorous atoms (see Fig. 5) are used as the stabilizer. Among
them, the dendrimer type stabilizers are used very frequently. This
is partly because the terminal groups of the dendrimers can be
easily tuned to provide the desired solubility in scCO2 or ﬂuorous
medium.

4.1.4. Typical stabilizers that are used in high boiling point
alcohols
These solvents are very polar due to the hydroxyl groups. In
principle, all stabilizers that work in water could be transferred
into these solvents. Current examples show the high boiling point

alcohols (most examples use PEG as reaction media), just like imidazolium based ILs, are sufﬁcient in protecting the NP. All reported
systems avoided the use of any additional stabilizer, though the
involvement of a second stabilizer may further enhance the NP
stability without exerting detrimental effects on the activity.

4.2. Strategies: balance between activity and stability
Stabilization strategies, according to their mechanism, are
generally divided into four kinds including electrostatic, steric,
electrosteric and coordinative stabilizations, which was ﬁrst suggested by Roucoux and Patin in their excellent review [121]. There
are ongoing interests in the discovery of more efﬁcient stabilizers
that can produce robust NP [122]. For catalytic purpose, however,
the central issue is to ﬁnd a suitable stabilizer that provides a balance between the catalytic activity and the stability of the NP, no
matter what stabilizing strategy is used.
There are numerous examples supporting the idea that robust
NPs are not necessarily good catalysts. An elegant case was
provided by Korgel and co-workers in 2005 in which Ir NP
was prepared by the reduction of (methylcyclopentadienyl)(1,5cyclooctadiene)Ir with hexadecanediol in the presence of four
different stabilizers, namely oleic acid/oleylamine, trioctylphosphine, tetraoctylammonium bromide, and tetraoctylphosphonium
bromide. Among them, the oleic acid/oleylamine stabilized NPs
were of the highest quality, with the narrowest size and shape
distribution. However, in the hydrogenation of 1-decene, oleic
acid/oleylamine protected Ir NPs were completely inactive. Ir NPs
stabilized by trioctylphosphine, which is also a strong ligand, were
also inactive. Less robust Ir NPs which were protected by the other
two stabilizers were highly active in the catalytic reactions. From
these the authors concluded that “Good capping ligands (i.e. those
that stabilize robust nanocrystals with very narrow size distributions) appear to be poor choices for catalytic applications” [123].
Similar trend was also observed for Rh NP [124]. For Pd NP, Li and
El-Sayed compared the effect of different stabilizers such as PVP,
polystyrene-b-poly(sodium acrylate) block copolymer, and G2–G4
PAMAM-OH dendrimers on its catalytic activity toward Suzuki
reaction. PVP stabilized Pd NP exhibited high catalytic activity
whereas block copolymers were found to provide better protection
for the NP surface compared to PVP. When the stability and catalytic
activity of Pd NP using different generations of PAMAM-OH dendrimers as stabilizers were compared, it was observed that G2 and

G3 dendrimers stabilized Pd NPs are efﬁcient catalysts for Suzuki
reaction. G4 dendrimers which can reasonably produce more stable
Pd NPs, however, led to a decrease in catalyst activity. The authors
proposed that G4 dendrimers encapsulate the NP so strong that
they cause a catalytic activity loss [125].
Therefore, it has been quite widely accepted that the stability
and catalytic activity are anti-correlated, which means the most
stable NPs are the least catalytically active. It is quite frustrating
for investigators in NP catalysis since it means E and S criteria cannot be simultaneously met. However we believe that achieving a
satisfying stability does not necessarily cost an activity loss. To elucidate this, we have to look into the stabilization mechanism and
the way the NP catalysts work. In our view, stabilizers, according
to the strength of their interactions with the NP surface, can be
divided into three main categories:
(a) “Strong” stabilizers. These stabilizers, including many nitrogen
(III) and phosphine containing agents such as oleylamine and
trioctylphosphine discussed previously, can interact with NP
surface strongly. In fact, these stabilizers are also widely used
ligands with excellent electron donating properties in homogenous catalysis. They form covalent bonds with the surface and
therefore prevent particles from aggregation.
(b) “Medium” stabilizers. This kind of stabilizers is generally composed of ionic surfactants and some simple ions, which form
a protective double layer to prevent the NP from aggregation.
They have interactions with the NP surface, but to a less extent
compared to “Strong” stabilizers.
(c) “Weak” stabilizers. This kind of stabilizers is usually noncoordinating polymers which can afford physical steric
hindrance to protect the NP. These polymers are generally physically absorbed on the NP surface and their interaction with NP
is the weakest.
If we consider a reaction catalyzed by NP, the ﬁrst elemental
step is always the adsorption of the reagents onto the NP surface.
As a result, the availability of the NP surface atoms is crucial for

1194

N. Yan et al. / Coordination Chemistry Reviews 254 (2010) 1179–1218

obtaining a high catalytic activity. Therefore it is not surprising to
see that NP stabilized by “Strong” stabilizer has an anti-correlated
relationship between its activity and stability. As stabilizer with
stronger coordination property is used, more surface atoms are
occupied by the irreversible adsorption of the stabilizers, leading
to a decrease in activity. In this occasion, the more stable the NPs
are, the less catalytically active they are. For the other types of stabilizers, increasing the protection ability (for example increasing
the amount of the stabilizer), which produces more stable NP, will
not change the catalytic activity to a considerable extent since the
active surface atoms of the NP are still available for the substrates.
As a result, it is possible to ﬁnd a stabilizer that can produce robust
and highly catalytic active NP at the same time. The way to achieve
this is (1) avoiding the participating of “Strong” stabilizers and (2)
designing stabilizers that combine steric/electrostatic stabilization
or steric/weak coordinating stabilization.
This point has not been clearly stated in previous literatures.
However, some clues can be gained from publications which are in
accordance with our hypothesis. For example, one of the most successful stabilizer, PVP, can provide both steric hindrance and weak
coordination properties through its N–C O structure. Another
piece of evidence, coming from one of our own reports, is that
PVP with higher molecular weight gave much more stable Pd NPs
whereas their catalytic activity toward the transformation of pcymene to limonene was intrinsically the same as those stabilized
with low molecular weight PVP [126].
4.3. Potentials in nanoparticle catalysis
As illustrated in Section 4.2, the stabilizer plays a dominant
role in the stability and activity of NP catalysts. In fact, the potentials of stabilizer in NP catalysis are far beyond that. At least, as
already demonstrated by researchers including us, there are two
other functions that the stabilizer can provide. One is recyclability
and the other is multi-functionality.
The control of the NP catalysts becomes possible when stimuliresponsive polymers are used as stabilizers. The structures and
properties of the stimuli-responsive polymers can change with
environmental parameters. Among them thermal sensitive polymer which undergoes a low critical solution temperature (LCST)
phase transition [127] (also known as an inverse temperature transition [128]) has attracted particular attention due to its great
potential in many ﬁelds such as catalysis [33,129], functional material synthesis [130], and nanoreactor manipulation [32]. Current
investigations of thermal-responsive polymers are largely based on
poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAm). The PNIPAAm exhibits a
LCST of 32 ◦ C, which was discovered by Heskins and Gillet, some
40 years ago [131], and has been extensively explored ever since
[132].
In this group, a series of alkyl-functionalized PVP were synthesized, all of which are excellent NP stabilizers (Scheme 16) [133].
Interestingly, the LCST of these polymers has a dependence on the
alkyl chain length. For example, C2 -PVP had a LCST of 26 ◦ C whereas

Scheme 16. Synthesis strategy for the preparation of alkyl group modiﬁed PVP
[135].

C4 -PVP had a LCST of 34 ◦ C (Fig. 6). The properties can be used for
the control of the reaction and the separation of catalysts. When the
temperature was below the LCST, the NP dispersed well in water
and the reactions progressed effectively. By contrast, once the temperature was raised up to LCST, the NP precipitated and thereby the
reaction was shut down. It also leads to the separation of the NP
from the solution. It was observed that in the decomposition reaction of NaBH4 catalyzed by Au NP stabilized by C2 -PVP, the reaction
rate increased as temperature increased from 15 to 20 ◦ C, and then
the reaction completely ceased when the temperature was 30 ◦ C
[134].
Furthermore, stabilizer has the potential to provide multifunctionality to NP catalytic systems. Some stabilizers can be
regarded as the solid support that is used in classical heterogeneous catalysis. And multifunctional solid supports are also widely
used. For example, the Pt/zeolite catalysts, used in the cracking
process in petroleum industry, are bifunctional. Pt centers provide the dehydrogenation capacity and the zeolite provides acid
center for the activation of alkane rearrangements [135]. In contrast, multifunctional catalytic systems for NP catalysis have not
been well-examined. We believe that such system, for example that
composed of tailored stabilizer that bears acidic/basic moieties and
the NP center, will be one of the future research interests.
5. Role of the solvent
5.1. Key issue: reaching green
NP catalytic systems are greener than many stoichiometric reactions if judged by the twelve principles of green chemistry in which
a catalytic process is preferred. However, solvent is an even more
important parameter that determines the green nature of the NP
catalysis, regarding the fact that the solvent accounts for 50% of
the green house gas emissions during post-treatment and 60% of
the energy used in pharmaceutical processes [136]. Over the last
20 years, conventional solvent alternatives have attracted much

Fig. 6. Temperature dependent behavior of Cn-PVP (5 bottles in the left are C2 -PVP, 5 bottles in the right are C4 -PVP in water) [136].

N. Yan et al. / Coordination Chemistry Reviews 254 (2010) 1179–1218

attention from both academia and industry. In the domain of NP
catalysis, water, ILs, ﬂuorous solvents and carbon dioxide all draw
considerable attention. However, as predicted by DeSimone, environmental advantage alone probably will not enable alternative
solvents to achieve widespread applicability [137]. The full potential of alternative solvents will only be reached if researchers exploit
their beneﬁts beyond their intrinsic environmental advantages.
Indeed, efﬁciency and cost-effectiveness are also the demands of
green chemistry itself [138]. In the context of NP catalysis, we
believe that such “advantageous properties” including accelerated
reaction rates, improved selectivities, enhanced NP stabilities, and
diminished catalyst leaching, will enable NP catalysis in green solvent to be a fully green and sustainable process.
It is well known that solvents play a critical role in many organic
and inorganic reactions as they modify both reaction equilibrium
and kinetics [139]. In NP catalysis, it has been demonstrated that
solvents can bear other functions such as acting as reductants, (co)stabilizers, promoters and even co-catalysts beyond their role as
green reaction media. For example, polyethylene glycol (PEG) can
be used as a reductant, stabilizer and reaction solvent in the same
system (see Section 6.5 for details). In the NP catalyzed aqueous
reaction, the pH value of the solvent is an important factor that can
inﬂuence the catalytic behaviors. Some stabilizers are pH-sensitive
[140]. And in water the acidity/basicity may strongly inﬂuence the
micellar characteristics which are correlated with catalytic properties, and may be used as an important tool to tailor the catalytic
activity and selectivity. For instance, the selective hydrogenation
of dehydrolinalool (3,7-dimethyloct-6-ene-1-yne-3-ol) to linalool
(3,7-dimethyloct-1,6-dene-3-ol) catalyzed by Pd NPs, which were
stabilized by poly(ethylene oxide)-block-2-vinylpyridine (PEO-bP2VP) micelles, was studied by varying the pH value of the reaction
medium. The highest selectivity (99.4%) was obtained at pH 9.4 and
95 vol% of i-PrOH, and the highest TOF was 24.4 h−1 at pH 13.0. The
authors attributed this pH dependence to the local concentration
variation of the pyridine unit according to the pH change, i.e. higher
pH value causes less dense micelles, which increases reaction rate
by increasing diffusions of the substrate within the micelles and
meanwhile decreases the selectivity since it causes higher pyridine
unit density [141].
The potential of utilizing solvents to beneﬁt NP catalytic process was largely achieved by ILs. ILs, also called tailoring solvents
because of their great ﬂexibility in properties by modifying the

1195

structures of catalysts, provide an ideal platform for studying the
“additional beneﬁts” of solvents in NP catalyzed reactions. Similar
to PEG, ILs can be used as stabilizers for NP, as ﬁrst demonstrated by
Dupont et al. in 2002 [142]. Indeed, the driving forces for NP aggregation are much low in ILs, and therefore, the metal NP could be
better stabilized [143]. ILs can be functionalized and attached with
weak coordination groups to further enhance the stability as well
as catalytic activity in the reaction. For example, Zhao et al. used
nitrile-functionalized IL to protect Pd NP with an average diameter
of 5 nm. The resulting Pd NPs were excellent recyclable catalysts
for Suzuki, Heck and Stille coupling reactions, achieving an optimum balance between stability and reactivity. Besides, the Pd NPs
were very stable and could be kept for more than several months
without obvious aggregation [121]. The weak coordinative ability
of the CN group was believed to eliminate the aggregation of the
Pd NP during the reaction. Using functionalized ILs can broaden the
synthesis methodologies. For example, the most widely used stabilizer, PVP, is only soluble in very polar solvents such as water and
alcohol, which limits its utilization considerably. Recently, it was
reported that the OH group functionalized ILs enable the direct use
of PVP for the protection of NP. The Rh NPs were prepared and
used for the hydrogenation of styrene with easy catalyst recovery
and excellent stability [120]. OH group functionalized ILs were also
used as the media of Pd NP catalyzed Suzuki reactions [144]. Compared to non-functionalized ILs, the OH-IL system leads to much
better NP activity and resistance to poison. Furthermore, the OHIL system is capable of converting challenging substrates such as
hindered and chloro substituted substrates. The IL plays a critical
role in catalyst/substrate activation by directly facilitating a ligandfree catalytic system. First, it facilitates the generation/stabilization
of the catalyst. Second, its OH group bonding with the halogen
atom helps activate the C–X bond. Third, it aids the dissolution of
salts generated during the catalytic cycle facilitating reaction and
preventing catalyst poisoning (see Scheme 17).
Based on the study of NP catalysis in ILs, it is demonstrated
that solvents may also be critical parameters for the selectivity in
the reaction. For example, partial hydrogenation of arenes is a big
challenge as much more active catalysts are required compared
with that of alkenes, because of the need to break the aromaticity. ILs present a potential solution for this. Partial hydrogenation
of arene [145] or diene [146] compounds into monoenes over
NP in ILs has been reported by several groups, including us. In

our group, an IL-like polymer stabilized Rh NP in [BMIM]BF4 was
applied to the hydrogenation of n-alkyl-benzene, phenylmethanol
and xylenes [147]. For all the cases, partially hydrogenated products
were observed, with the yield ranging from 1 to 32%. The unique
selectivity towards the partially hydrogenated products may be due
to the solubility difference between the substrate and the products,
i.e. the monoene product is insoluble in IL phase and therefore separated from the catalytic system upon formation, suppressing the
full hydrogenation reactions. Water exhibited similar selectivity
trends in the partial hydrogenation of arene and diene compounds
for the same reasons, as demonstrated by Widegren and Finke
[148].
Solvent may have selected interactions with moieties of a substrate, which can inﬂuence the selectivity of a reaction. We found
that in the hydrogenation of o-chloronitrobenzene (o-CNB) catalyzed by Pt NP, the selectivity for o-chloroaniline (o-CAN) was
nearly 100% when the reaction was performed in [BMIM]BF4
whereas a selectivity of less than 50% was observed in methanol
with similar Pt NP catalyst [149]. It was reported that the addition
of metal ions as additives can signiﬁcantly improve the reaction
selectivity since these metal ions may interact weakly with the
nitro groups [150]. To understand if ILs have similar effects as these
metal ion additives, IR absorption spectroscopy and DFT study were
applied. A red shift of the asymmetric stretch vibration of the nitro
group (from 1537 to 1533 cm−1 ) was observed when the solvent
was switched from diethyl ether to [BMIM]BF4 . However, the vibration frequency did not alter when the solvent changed from diethyl
ether to methanol. These results indicated that there were strong
molecular interactions between the nitro group on o-CNB and ILs.
Further evidence was obtained from DFT calculations, showing that
the intermolecular interactions of [BMIM]BF4 and o-CNB did not
weaken the C–Cl bonds but only N O bonds. ILs can also enhance
the selectivity of the hydrogenation of C O bonds in the presence of C C. An example reported by us is the hydrogenation of
cinnamaldehyde into cinnamyl alcohol over Ru NP in ILs [151].
Compared to the extensive study of NP catalysis by modifying
the metal center and the stabilizer, the potential effects of the solvent on the reaction are still a relatively unexplored area though a
few successful examples have already been achieved. More attention should be paid to this aspect since solvent is one of the three
key factors for NP catalysis in liquid phase.
5.2. Key issue: reaching biphase
Solvent also plays an important role in the recovery and reuse
of catalyst. As described in Section 2, the recyclability issue is a
big obstacle for the practice of NP catalysis in solutions. Although
there are many attempts to heterogenise homogeneous catalysts by
attaching them to organic or inorganic supports, only quite limited
successes were achieved and no commercially viable process was
developed. The need for efﬁcient separation of product and catalyst,
while maintaining the advantages of a homogeneous catalyst, has
led to the concept of liquid–liquid biphasic catalysis [152].
Biphasic catalysis was ﬁrst developed for the utilization of
homogenous catalyst. Due to the similarity of homogenous catalysis and NP catalysis in solutions, this technique makes it possible
to fully utilize the inherent advantages of NP catalysis in solution
phase as well. Since most conventional organic solvents are miscible with each other, the biphasic catalysis usually involves at
least one nonconventional solvent. Almost all kinds of green solvents have been intensively studied under biphasic conditions with
different combinations with conventional solvents.
The idea of aqueous/organic biphasic systems is ﬁrst expressed
by Manassen in 1973 [153], which ﬁnally led to the ﬁrst industrialized hydroformylation process in the early 1980s [154].
Aqueous/organic biphasic systems for NP catalysis came in late

1980s [155] and were intensively investigated ever since [156].
One disadvantage of the aqueous/organic biphasic systems is the
low distribution efﬁciency of the organic substrate in water, which
resulted in low reaction rates. To overcome this problem, phase
transfer reagents are sometimes required. In some occasions, NP
stabilizers themselves were surfactants which can help phase
transfer during the reaction [157].
Traditional aqueous/organic biphasic systems are now being
augmented by other biphasic combinations such as IL/organic [158]
and ﬂuorous/organic systems [159]. The beneﬁt of both ILs and ﬂuorous solvents is their tunability. They can be designed to reach
desired phase properties. For ﬂuorous solvents, it is even possible
that the reaction is homogenous at elevated temperatures whereas
became biphasic after cooling down due to the thermal sensitive
solubilities of some ﬂuorous solvents in organic phase [160].
6. Current examples of nanoparticle catalysis in green
solvents
Solvents are playing critical roles in establishing an efﬁcient and
sustainable process given the fact that the use of solvents accounts
for 50% of the post-treatment of green house gas emissions and
60% of the energy used in pharmaceutical processes [161]. There
are many investigations on NP catalysis in green solvents. In order
to give the readers more complete information, we decided to
describe brieﬂy the history and/or advantages as well as environmental considerations of the solvent followed by exhibiting fairly
complete lists of the reported reactions in tables. The selection rule
for the examples in the tables is that if a paper described only one
type of reactions, the optimized conditions for the most challenging
substrates are selected. If the paper involves more than one type of
reactions, representative example from each type is provided.
6.1. The greenness of green solvents
As solvent for organic reactions, water bears a number of attractive physicochemical properties over traditional organic solvents. It
is non-ﬂammable, non-toxic and non-carcinogenic, and in addition,
water is probably the least expensive and most easily accessible
solvents [162]. scCO2 bears most of these beneﬁts that water has.
Besides, scCO2 is characterized by gas like viscosities and solvating
properties of a wide range of various organic solvents. Furthermore,
the rapid mass transfer properties associated with the low viscosity
of supercritical ﬂuid (SCF) carbon dioxide can bring about efﬁcient
production capabilities for various types of important industrial
processes [163]. Therefore, the use of water and scCO2 as reaction media is consistent with the current trend towards the use
of renewable, biomass-based raw materials, which are ultimately
derived from carbon dioxide and water. Due to these environmental benign natures, few will challenge water and scCO2 as green
solvents. The concern of using water as reaction medium is that its
heat capacity is one of the biggest in all materials, which means
a lot more external energy input compared to organic solvents in
the heating process. The issue with scCO2 is the inherent high pressure involved in all scCO2 related process, which is against the basic
principle of green chemistry.
ILs have widely been promoted as “green solvents”. The reason for calling them green generally includes their nonvolatility,
nonﬂammability and nontoxicity. The perceived environmentally
friendly nature of ILs is however under scrutiny now since they
may not as green as we thought, especially when we consider
their toxicity [164]. Recent research results clearly indicate that
most ILs in fact exhibit detrimental effects on aquatic ecosystems,
microorganisms and animals [165]. Therefore they are not fully
environmentally benign [166].

N. Yan et al. / Coordination Chemistry Reviews 254 (2010) 1179–1218

Although ILs are still “greener” than most common organic solvents, the concern for their potential environmental risk makes
ILs that were thought fully green and ideally bio-derived, highly
derisible. The adjustable nature of ILs once again embodies the
importance of designing solvents, i.e. ILs can be designed to be
nontoxic. With this conception, a new generation of ILs, where
the cations were derived directly from natural ␣-amino acids and
␣-amino acid ester salts were used [167]. Consequently, the greenness level of this new generation of ILs has been enhanced to
full-greenness using nontoxic inorganic or organic anions [168].
ILs with anions derived from natural amino acids have also been
developed [169]. We believe that the combination of metal NPs
and these novel bio-derived ILs represents a direction for future
research and will better fulﬁll the ESSR criteria.
Fluorous solvents, with perﬂuorinated alkanes being the most
representative, possess unusual physicochemical properties, such
as low dielectric constants, high chemical and thermal stability,
and low toxicity. There are, however, some concerns on ﬂuorous
solvents regarding bio-safety and environmental issues. For example, they are bioaccumulative. Also, they are greenhouse gases
[170]. Although perﬂuoroethers are less problematic, they cannot
be treated as fully green solvents. The reason that in this review the
ﬂuorous solvents are still included is mainly that they obey some
of the basic principles in green chemistry. They form many biphasic systems which make separation extremely facial and they can
easily be reused for many times due to their stability.
High boiling alcohols, including glycerol and PEG, have recently
attracted much attention as reaction media [171]. They are cheap,
easily functionalized and more importantly, nontoxic. Glycerol is a
natural product and is widely used as cosmetic and food additive.
PEG is also nontoxic [172] and in fact it is so benign that they are
approved for use in pharmaceutical [173] and food industry [174].
The low-toxicity, low volatility, and biodegradability of high boiling
point alcohols represent important environmentally benign characteristics, which are particularly attractive when combined with
their relatively low cost as a bulk commodity chemical [175].
6.2. Water
“The best solvent is no solvent and if a solvent is needed then
water is preferred”, statement from Sheldon in his recent review
[176], in which the methods to assess environmental impact of
chemical process were described, reﬂects the current perception in
chemical industry. Indeed, water is cheap, readily available, nontoxic, non-ﬂammable and safe to environment. In particular, for the
catalysis purpose, there are several other advantages that water can
provide:
(a) The inertness against oxidation and reduction. Water can be neither oxidized, nor reduced easily. In fact, both the oxidation and
reduction of water are among the most challenging reactions for
chemists. This feature is of great value when water acts as the
reaction medium, especially for oxidation reactions, which are
much less practiced in other green solvents, such as ILs.
(b) High polarity. Since most reactions of interest are the transformation of organic compounds that usually have quite lower
polarity compared to water. As a result, biphasic catalysis
becomes available, which thereby dramatically decreases the
working up process.
(c) High solvation ability. Water has very high solvation ability
towards many cations and anions. Some ions that are usually
poisons for the catalyst, such as Cl− , can be solvated by water
and their afﬁnity to metals are greatly reduced.
With so many beneﬁts, it is not surprising that there are numerous studies on NP in water. The investigated reactions almost

1197

covered all catalytic reaction types except a few that are sensitive to water. Investigations focused on the use of noble metal NP,
partly due to the general instability of 3-d zero valent metal NP.
Recently, however, some investigations suggested that 3-d metal
NPs are far more stable than people had anticipated if they are prepared in water. The ﬁrst example of water-dispersible nickel(0) NP
was reported by Özkar and co-workers. The Ni NPs were prepared
from the reduction of nickel(II) acetylacetonate by sodium borohydride in aqueous solution and stabilized by hydrogen phosphate
anion. The authors tested the catalytic behavior of the Ni catalyst
toward the hydrolysis of sodium borohydride. A TON of 1450 was
found before the catalyst underwent deactivation. Interestingly, it
was observed through kinetic analysis that the apparent activation
energy of the Ni NP catalyzed hydrolysis of sodium borohydride was
substantially lower than that of the Ni bulk metal catalyzed reaction
[177]. Fe NPs have also been prepared and were used for catalyzing
the decomposition of ammonia borane recently [178]. For detailed
information of current status of metal NP catalysis including that
of both noble and 3-d metals in water, please refer to the examples
in Table 3.
6.3. Ionic liquid
In 2001–2002 when we prepared a review paper for Catalysis
Today entitled “Ionic liquids: applications in catalysis”, there was
few studies on NP catalysis in ILs up to the end of 2001. However,
we realized that ILs should be of great potential for the development of highly efﬁcient NP catalytic systems. In the conclusion,
we proposed that “Ionic liquids offer the opportunity of combining
the advantages of both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis in one system. That is to say, immobilization of a catalyst
(metal/oxide/complex) by supporting it in an ionic liquid rather
than on a surface may create highly free, three-dimensional centers as in a homogeneous catalyst but the catalytic reaction occurs
at the interface between the ionic liquid (rather than a solid) and
the reactants in either the gas or immiscible liquid phase. Development of application of three-dimensional heterogeneous catalysis
using ionic liquids as supports should present challenges for us
over the next decade and beyond [179].” More than 7 years have
passed since we prepared this review, it is indeed a pleasure to ﬁnd
that NP catalysis in ILs has already grown from a little seed into
a giant tree. The ﬁrst example of NP catalysis in ILs comes from
Dupont’s group, in which Ir NPs were obtained by the reduction of
organometallic precursor and stabilized by [BMIM]PF6 [180]. Following that, extensive studies on NP preparation and application
in catalysis were reported, covering a wide range of reaction types
including hydrogenation, C–C coupling, and occasionally oxidation
[181]. The beneﬁt that ILs can provide ﬁrst comes from the fact
that the tendency of the aggregation of NP is much lower in ionic
environment. Therefore, the NP can be stabilized to some extent
without any additional stabilizers. Second, the tunable miscibility
of ILs enables facial recycling of the solvents as well as the immobilized NP. Furthermore, some reactions catalyzed by NP exhibit
unusual but desired selectivity patterns when performed in ILs, as
demonstrated by selective hydrogenation reaction in Section 5.1.
These advantages, coupled with the intrinsic “green” nature of ILs,
made NP in ILs an appealing ﬁeld to explore. Since there are recently
several excellent reviews, even one textbook [182] on this topic, we
only provide in Table 4 a collection of research reported on NP catalysis in ILs from 2002 to mid-2009, which to our knowledge has not
been done so far.
6.4. Supercritical solvents
scCO2 was widely used in extraction as a replacement of the
toxic conventional organic solvent. In the recent 15 years, the focus

of its research has been shifted from separation techniques to catalytic reactions and synthesis. For general applications of scCO2 in
creating green process and products, please refer to some excellent more speciﬁc reviews [183]. In the domain of NP catalysis,
the applicability of colloid catalysts in SCFs was ﬁrst tested by
Zemaian et al. and only very low conversion rates were obtained
[184]. They reported the hydrogenation of naphthalene to tetralin
using a colloidal CoMoO3 catalyst in reverse micelles in supercritical butane at about 150 ◦ C. However, the reaction was sluggish,
with a conversion rate of less than 1%. This example indicates that
catalyst solubility is a big issue for NP catalysis in SCF. Ji et al. in
1999 reported a stable suspension of Ag NP in scCO2 by employing a mixture of sodium bis(2-ethylhexyl)sulfosuccinate (AOT) and
a perﬂuoropolyether-phosphate ether (PFPE-PO4 ) as the stabilizer
[185]. The formation of optically clear microemulsions containing
Ag NP was conﬁrmed by in situ UV–vis spectroscopy as well as
off-line TEM analysis. The main drawback of this work is that the
resulting Ag NP exhibited a rather large size distribution ranging
from 5 to about 25 nm as observed from TEM pictures, which is not
favorable for subsequent catalytic applications. This problem was
soon addressed by selecting another stabilizer. In 2000, Johnston
and Korgel found that by using a thiolated ﬂuorocarbon molecule,
1H, 1H, 2H, 2H-perﬂuorodecanethiol, as capping agent, Ag NPs were
formed from Ag+ by NaBH4 reduction [186]. The size distribution of
the Ag NPs were 5.5 ± 2.2 nm, which is much narrower than previous results. An issue that was not considered by the authors is that
as they used (C8 H17 )4 NBr as the phase transfer catalyst, their Ag NPs
might be co-stabilized by thiolated ﬂuorocarbon and (C8 H17 )4 NBr.
These results represent signiﬁcant advance in scCO2 solvent-based
catalysis systems since they paved the way to the coming soluble
NP catalysis in scCO2 .
The ﬁrst example of catalysis in pure liquid or scCO2
using soluble metal NP was done by Yeung et al. [187].
They used dendrimer-encapsulated NPs as catalysts, speciﬁcally, Pd(0) NP sequestered within ﬁfth-generation poly(propylene
imine) (PPI) dendrimers that have perﬂuoro-2,5,8,11-tetramethyl3,6,9,12-tetraoxapentadecanoyl perﬂuoropolyether chains covalently attached to their periphery. The perﬂuoropolyether chains
in the dendrimer endowed Pd NP with miscibility in scCO2 .
However, the catalytic performance is far from satisfying. In
the hydrogenation of styrene into ethyl benzene, the TOF is
between 10 and 25 h−1 , whereas in the Heck type reaction
between methylacrylate and iodobenzene the TOF is even lower
(ca. 1 h−1 ).
Neither traditional organic (sodium triacetoxyborohydride,
sodium cyanoborohydride, etc.) nor inorganic (NaBH4 ) reducing
agents are ideal for metal reduction in scCO2 because they generally have limited solubility in scCO2 and may form byproducts that
could complicate further utilization. Ohde et al. used H2 instead as
the reducing agent [188]. By using AOT and PFPE-PO4 as the stabilizer, they successfully synthesized Pd NP with a size range of
5-10 nm which is an active C C double bond hydrogenation catalyst. The authors also demonstrated that this catalytic system is
active toward hydrogenation reactions with both scCO2 soluble and
water soluble substrates.
Catalytic hydrogenation of arenes with soluble NP in a water-inscCO2 microemulsion has also been realized [189]. Again by using
AOT and PFPE-PO4 as the stabilizer, Rh NP with a diameter range
of 3–5 nm formed in water core from Rh3+ by H2 reduction,. Then
naphthalene was selected for hydrogenation because it absorbs in
the UV region that could be monitored by in situ cell. The TOF was
ca. 15 h−1 at 50 ◦ C. The Rh NPs are also active in phenol hydrogenation, with similar TOF values. Unfortunately, the Rh NPs were not
stable under reactive conditions. After only 20–30 min, they began
to lose activity. The authors attributed this to the aggregation of the
Rh NPs.

high as 4,000,000 h−1 under optimized conditions, a value of
at least one order of magnitude higher than previous reports.
Unfortunately, the author did not have any explanation on the
extraordinary catalytic performance. And the claim that Pd/Cu NP
suited in polystyrene-block-poly-4-vinylpyridine were homogenously dispersed in scCO2 is against chemical intuition. There is
no subsequent report on this work.
Recently, a combined extraction and hydrodechlorination of
chlorinated biphenyls in scCO2 was reported by Wai and coworkers. Polychlorinated biphenyls spiked in soil can be extracted
by a continuous ﬂow SCF carbon dioxide system and converted
on-line to bicyclohexyl using a polymer-stabilized Pd NP catalyst
[194]. scCO2 /aqueous [195], scCO2 /ILs [196] biphasic media are also
applied for NP catalysis.
Besides, scCO2 is widely used to facilitate nano-material preparation [197], but these investigations are beyond the scope of the
current review. For a collection of NP catalysis in scCO2, see Table 5.

6.5. Fluorous solvents

Scheme 18. Hydrogenation pathways of citral [193].

Although it is not unreasonable to conclude that in all the above
cases the NP stayed in the microemulsion, the direct evidence did
not come until 2004 when Meric et al. reported the ﬁrst direct visualization that the majority of metal NPs are in the microemulsion
state, which is observed through a sapphire window reactor [190].
The NPs were prepared by using CF3 (CF2 )12 COO− NH4 + ﬂuorosurfactant as stabilizer, Pd(NO3 )2 as the metal precursor and H2 as
the reducing agent. Interestingly, in the hydrogenation of citral,
that has three reducible functionalities (see Scheme 18), the major
product was citronellal, which is indicative of a kinetic reluctance of
the double bond hydrogenation at the hydrophobic end of the citral by the micelle-hosted Pd particles. Such phenomena could lead
to better control of catalytic selectivity by using designed micelle
as a “soft” scaffold [191]. Later, the same group reported the CO2
pressure dependent selectivity of the hydrogenation of citral by
Ru and Pd NP protected by CF3 (CF2 )12 COO− NH4 + in the waterscCO2 microemulsion [192]. They found that selective formation
of a particular hydrogenated product from citral became possible
by careful tuning the pressure of the ﬂuid. For example, in the case
of Pd catalyzed hydrogenation of citral, DMOL, DHAL and citronellal were the main products at the pressure of 80, 95, and 150 bar,
respectively. The effect of CO2 pressure on the reaction selectivity
was attributed to the change in metal surface accessibility towards
substrates.
As aforementioned, to solve the solubility issues, stabilizers with ﬂuorous tails are generally used. There is only one
exception. Niessen et al. found that polystyrene-block-poly-4vinylpyridine, a polymer that is generally thought to be only
soluble in non-polar organic solvents, stabilized Pd/Cu bimetallic NPs which are extremely efﬁcient hydrogenation catalysts
in scCO2 medium [193]. They selected ﬁve substrates containing C-C triple bond, including sterically hindered substrate,
3,3-dimethyl-1-butyne for catalyst test. In all the cases, TOF values were higher than 100,000 h−1 . For 1-hexyne, the TOF is as

Fluorous solvents, with perﬂuorinated alkanes being most representative, possess unusual physicochemical properties, such as
low dielectric constants, high chemical and thermal stability, and
low toxicity [198]. They are commonly immiscible with organic solvents at low temperatures but miscible at elevated temperature.
This feature affords a homogeneous phase for the reaction at high
temperature and easy catalyst/product separation at ambient conditions, which is of particular interests to biphasic catalysis [199].
In 2000, Crooks and co-workers reported their work on the application of dendrimer-encapsulated Pd NP in ﬂuorous solvent for the
ﬁrst time [200]. In this work, poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimers were non-covalently modiﬁed with perﬂuoropolyethers
to increase the solubility in ﬂuorous phase, which was achieved
by complexing the terminal dendrimer amine groups with the carboxylic end groups of the perﬂuoropolyethers. The Pd NPs were
an active and stable catalyst for alkene hydrogenation in a mixture of THF/perﬂuoro-2-butyltetrahydrofuran (FC-75). Recycling
test showed that after 12 runs, neither appreciable loss of catalytic
activity nor detectable leaking of the catalyst into the organic phase
was observed. The hydrogenation reaction is the ﬁrst successful
applications of NP in ﬂuorous solvents, and very few other examples
are known. A recent investigation done by West et al. introduced
CO2 into the ﬂuorous-organic mixture [201]. By using the same Pd
NP as described above, they found that the hydrogenation reaction
of allylic alcohol to n-propanol was accelerated, probably because
CO2 induced miscibility of the ﬂuorous-organic mixtures.
The pioneer work of NP catalyzed C–C coupling reactions in ﬂuorous solvents was also done by Yeung and Crook. [202]. Since
PAMAM is only stable at temperatures lower than 100 ◦ C, they use
poly(propylene imine) (PPI) derivative instead as the stabilizer. The
thermal decomposition temperature of PPI is higher than 400 ◦ C,
therefore it is much better suited for applications in which long
periods of reﬂuxing at high temperatures are necessary such as
most C–C coupling reactions. The NPs were prepared by introducing
Pd2+ into the interiors of amine-terminated PPI dendrimers, which
were previously end-group derivatized (>90%) with perﬂuorinated
polyether chains, followed by the reduction of Pd ions. The Pd NP
exhibited excellent performance in catalyzing the Heck coupling
of inactivated aryl halides with butylacrylate under comparatively
mild conditions. Interestingly, selectivity for the production of the
trans isomer of n-butyl-formylcinnamate, which had previously
been reported to be in the range of 74–98% in homogenous catalysis
in ﬂuorous phase [203], reached 100% in the case of Pd-dendrimer
systems. The authors believed the region-selectivity is a result of
the sterically conﬁned environment within the dendrimer.

ˇ reported the ﬁrst Pd NP catalyzed
Pleixats and Moreno-Manas
Suzuki reaction in ﬂuorous phase [204]. Their ﬁrst attempt was to
synthesize complex Pd(dba-Rf)2 following a similar procedure for
the preparation of Pd(dba)2 . However, instead of obtaining Pd(dbaRf)2 , they generated Pd NP stabilized by the ﬂuorinated ligand. The
ligand rendered the NP soluble in ﬂuorous media. The chosen reaction was the production of 1,3-diphenylpropene from cinnamyl
bromide and phenylboronic acid. After ﬁve batches, the catalytic
system remained active, with a slightly decrease in yield of 1,3diphenylpropene from 90 to 78%. The Pd NPs were also active in
Heck reactions under similar conditions. A considerable drawback
of the work is the high loading of the catalyst (from 4 to 64%).
The exploration of NP catalysis in ﬂuorous solvent tended to
cease after 2004. Applications of ﬂuorous solvents in NP catalysis
are practiced to a much smaller extent compared to other green
solvents such as water and ILs. The potential of the catalysis of
soluble NP in ﬂuorous ﬂuid has not been fully explored. Some literature reported the preparation of soluble metal NPs in ﬂuorous
solvents, including those of Ag [205] and Au [206], without considering their catalytic properties. Others synthesized NP protected
by stabilizers bearing ﬂuorous moiety. But their catalytic reactions
were performed in conventional molecular solvents like DMF [207].
All reported examples of NP catalysts in ﬂuorous solvents are
compiled in Table 6.
6.6. High boiling point alcohols
The utilization of PEGs as reaction media has attracted much
attention recently [208]. PEGs are cheap, nontoxic, and their properties can be tuned by changing their molecular weight [209].
There are numerous studies on the synthesis of metal NP in PEG
(polyol method) where PEG acts as a reducing agent [210]. The
ﬁrst attempt of using PEGs as both reducing agent and reactive
media appeared in 2004. Pillai and Sahle-Demessie carried out
selective hydrogenation of oleﬁns using phenanthroline stabilized
Pd NP as the catalyst in PEG400 (PEG400 stands for PEG with
an average molecular weight of 400 g/mol) [211]. The catalyst
can effectively and selectively catalyze the hydrogenation of C C
groups without effecting C O group. Neither decreased activity nor
leaching of Pd was observed in the recycling test. Similar results
were obtained by other groups. For example, Cheng et al. reported
that Pd NP, synthesized in PEGs without additional stabilizer, is a
reusable and selective catalyst for the hydrogenation of C C functionalities. Other metal NPs rather than Pd were also investigated.
PEG-stabilized Pt NP [212] and PEG/carbon nanoﬁber co-stabilized
Ru NP [213] were applied for the selective hydrogenation of o-CNB
to o-CAN and the hydrogenation of arenes, respectively.
Pd NP/PEG systems for C–C coupling reactions have been investigated by several groups. Luo et al. explored Heck reaction catalyzed
by Pd NP in PEGs with different molecular weights [214]. Interestingly, the reactivity of PEG in the reduction of Pd2+ into Pd
NP is very sensitive to its average molecular weight. The larger
the PEGs were, the easier the reduction of Pd2+ was. The activity of Pd NP toward Heck reaction, on the other hand, did not
exhibit such monotonic trend, with PEG2000 being the best system. Under optimized conditions, Pd NP/PEGs are able to catalyze
coupling of challenging substrate such as chlorobenzene. Corma
and co-workers also reported C–C coupling reactions in PEGs [215].
Their strategy was to covalently anchor oxime carbapalladacycle on
PEG6000 scaffold, and use the resulting polymer as soluble catalyst
for Suzuki, Sonogashira and Heck reactions in PEG media. During
the reaction (recycling) the catalysts decompose and form catalytically less active Pd NP with an average particle size of 6 nm. As
a result, for less demanding Pd catalyzed reactions, such as the
Sonogashira coupling of aryl bromides, the catalytic system can
be reused for many cycles. On the contrary, for highly demanding

reactions, such as aryl chloride coupling reactions, reusability is
low.
Very recently, the aerobic oxidation of various alcohols was
studied with the stabilized Pd NP as catalyst in PEG media [216]. In
previous studies, soluble Pd NPs are active and selective for alcohol
oxidation [217]. But conventional organic solvents were used and
the formation of Pd-black was observed in some cases. To solve both
problems, a stabilizer derived from PEGs, which contains bidentate
nitrogen ligands was synthesized and used for the preparation of Pd
NP in PEGs. The obtained Pd NP exhibited excellent activities in the
oxidation of a number of alcohols with excellent recyclability. The
authors suggested that the functionalized-PEG played a very crucial role in stabilizing Pd NP. Available examples for NP catalysis in
high boiling point alcohols are provided in Table 7.
To summarize, reported NP catalysis in PEGs shows that PEGs
have many advantages. They can act as reducing reagents, costabilizer and reaction media. The activities are usually high and
some systems exhibit intriguing selectivities. And in most cases,
the catalytic systems are recyclable. Nevertheless, NP catalysis in
PEGs is still an open arena for researchers, since only a few metal
NPs have been tested in this green media.
7. Conclusion and perspective
Catalysis is a central ﬁeld of nanoscience and nanotechnology
[308]. NP catalysis in the solution phase is an old topic but is now
well advanced due to the great progress in nanochemistry. Despite
the fact that this ﬁeld is in its gold rush era as reﬂected by the ever
increasing publications, for future implementation of NP catalysis
in industry, there are some requirements to meet. ESSR criteria are
therefore a timely standard to evaluate the current examples and a
guideline for designing new systems from a practical point of view.
Furthermore, we built up the links between ESSR criteria and the
three key parameters in NP catalysis, which have been thoroughly
discussed in Section 2. The systematic guidelines for the improvement of a NP catalytic system are therefore available for the ﬁrst
time. For the ease of making stories we divided a NP catalysis system separately into metal cores, stabilizers and solvents. In a real
system one must consider the delicate interplay of the three factors.
We hope our efforts would be helpful for rational design of novel NP
catalytic system, which could ﬁnally be applied in industry process
in the future.
