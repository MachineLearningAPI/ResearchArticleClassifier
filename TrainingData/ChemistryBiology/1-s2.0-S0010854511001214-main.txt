The increasing environmental concern and promotion of “green processes” are forcing the substitution
of traditional acid and base homogeneous catalysts by solid ones. Among these heterogeneous catalysts,
zeolites and zeotypes can be considered as real “green” catalysts, due to their benign nature from an
environmental point of view. The importance of these inorganic molecular sieves within the ﬁeld of heterogeneous catalysis relies not only on their microporous structure and the related shape selectivity,
but also on the ﬂexibility of their chemical composition. Modiﬁcation of the zeolite framework composition results in materials with acidic, basic or redox properties, whereas multifunctional catalysts
can be obtained by introducing metals by ion exchange or impregnation procedures, that can catalyze
hydrogenation–dehydrogenation reactions, and the number of commercial applications of zeolite based
catalysts is continuously expanding.

In this review we discuss determinant issues for the development of zeolite based catalysts, going from
zeolite catalyst preparation up to their industrial application. Concerning the synthesis of microporous
materials we present some of the new trends moving into larger pore structures or into organic free synthesis media procedures, thanks to the incorporation of novel organic templates or alternative framework
elements, and to the use of high-throughput synthesis methods. Post-synthesis zeolite modiﬁcation and
ﬁnal catalyst conformation for industrial use are brieﬂy discussed.
In a last section we give a thorough overview on the application of zeolites in industrial processes. Some of
them are well established mature technologies, such as ﬂuid catalytic cracking, hydrocracking or aromatics alkylation. Although the number of zeolite structures commercially used as heterogeneous catalysts
in these ﬁelds is limited, the development of new catalysts is a continuous challenge due to the need for
processing heavier feeds or for increasing the quality of the products. The application of zeolite based catalysts in the production of chemicals and ﬁne chemicals is an emerging ﬁeld, and will greatly depend on
the discovery of new or known structures by alternative, lower cost, synthesis routes, and the ﬁne tuning
of their textural properties. Finally, biomass conversion and selective catalytic reduction for conversion
of NOx are two active research ﬁelds, highlighting the interest in these potential industrial applications.

1. Introduction
Industrial catalysis and the corresponding catalytic processes
have evolved during the last 250 years, and have become essential nowadays, with more than 90% of all industrial chemicals
being produced by catalytic processes [1,2]. Catalysis is fundamental for a sustainable industrial society, where it accomplishes a
double objective: environmental protection and economic proﬁt.
Improved catalytic processes will lower energy requirements,
make a better use of natural resources, reduce the amount of
subproducts formed and eliminate contaminant efﬂuents. Heterogeneous catalysis provides additional advantages of easier
separation and lower salt and waste production [3].
Among the heterogeneous catalysts it is safe to say that zeolites
are the most widely used materials [4]. Besides their environmentally benign nature, the combination of a well-deﬁned microporous
structure with pore sizes in the range of molecular dimensions and
a ﬂexible chemical composition are key factors for their successful applications in ﬁelds as different as reﬁning, petrochemistry or
ﬁne and speciality chemicals. The main properties of these solids
are related to their topology and morphology, and chemical composition, that result in high surface area, the possibility of partitioning
reactants from products, high adsorption capacity, possible modulation of the electronic properties of the active sites, and the
presence of strong electric ﬁelds and conﬁnement effects within the
pores, which result in preactivation of the molecules. Last, but not
least, zeolites present an outstanding thermal and hydrothermal
stability [4].
Concerning their application as heterogeneous catalysts, the
shape selectivity effects introduced by zeolites are of paramount
importance. Indeed, their microporous channels, with dimensions
in the range of many reactant molecules, provide zeolites with
shape selectivity towards reactants, products or transition states
[5]. The shape selectivity involving reactants and products is due
to mass transport discrimination and is related to a true molecular
sieve effect [6]. Transition state selectivity occurs when the geometry of the pores can stabilize one transition state among several
possible. The implications of the fundamentals of shape selectivity
on the development of catalysts for petroleum and petrochemical
applications have been overviewed by Degnan in [7]. Despite the
advantages that these shape selective properties confer on zeolites,
as compared to other heterogeneous catalysts, they may become
inadequate when processing reactants with molecular dimensions
above those of the pores. Therefore big efforts have been made in
order to increase the accessibility of active sites to larger molecules
and to reduce the impact of diffusional problems on catalyst life.
Possible approaches are: to synthesize extra-large pore zeolites
[8–12], to decrease crystal size by direct synthesis [13–19] or by
zeolite delamination [20], reducing in this way the length of the

diffusion path. Another way of decreasing the length of the diffusion path is to generate mesopores in the zeolite crystals by means
of carbon templating [21,22], by chemical or steam postsynthesis
treatments [23] or by the use of supramolecular templating [24].
Broadly, the zeolite production directed to catalytic uses is close
to 20% of the total zeolite market, the rest being focused to detergents (70%) and adsorbents (10%) [25]. Despite these consumption
data, catalytic applications are by far the largest in terms of market
value, being this especially so in the oil reﬁning industry. In fact, the
catalytic cracking industry alone represents more than 95%, with a
maximum catalyst cost of 5$/kg. The rest accounts for specialty
zeolites (20–30$/kg), where the catalyst value depends not only on
the zeolite synthesis and modiﬁcations, but also on the value of the
ﬁnal product [25,26].
Most of the current large scale commercial processes using zeolite based catalysts are in the petroleum reﬁning and petrochemical
industry [27]. Applications for the chemical industry involve mainly
oximation, epoxidation, acylations, condensation and amination
processes. Moreover, their presence is increasing in emerging ﬁelds
such as environmental applications, the transformation of raw
materials by means of non-conventional processes, such as coal,
gas and oil conversion into syngas, oleﬁns, acetylene and aromatics, all of them involved in value added chains, and conversion of
methanol to propylene (MTP) and gasoline (MTG) [25]. Their potential application in the conversion of biomass is also gaining interest
and has been recently reviewed [28].
If we compare the industrial application of acid and base solid
catalysts, only 8% of the processes correspond to solid bases and
none of these reactions, as far as we know, is performed with basic
zeolite catalysts, although pilot plant trials were conducted in some
cases [29–31]. An important handicap for the industrial application
of basic zeolites relies on the fact that inexpensive NaOH and KOH
are the competing catalysts. Their low cost and the easy processing
of the residues formed, reduce the possibility of zeolite application
to cases where special selectivity effects will be needed.
In this manuscript we will introduce some developments in the
ﬁeld of zeolites that go from synthesis and modiﬁcation to their
conformation as heterogeneous catalysts and application in commercial processes. The processes presented range from oil reﬁning
and petrochemicals to ﬁne chemicals, and from conversion of alternative raw materials such as natural gas or biomass to the reduction
of contaminants in stationary and mobile source emissions. Our aim
has been to highlight the most recent advances in all these ﬁelds and
to direct the reader to more speciﬁc revisions recently published.
2. Synthesis of inorganic molecular sieves
Increasing environmental concern and development of green
processes based on heterogeneous catalysts are driving forces, not

only for the improvement of conventional zeolites but also for
discovering new molecular sieves with novel pore architectures
[9–11,25,32,33]. However, it is important to note that the wellestablished “big-ﬁve” zeolites, i.e. Y, ZSM-5, Mordenite, Beta and
Ferrierite, are difﬁcult to beat, due to their good performance and
relatively low cost production, as they do not require the use of
expensive or complex organic structure directing agents for their
synthesis [34].
S.T. Wilson, in a very interesting overview concerning the new
trends in zeolites synthesis, remarks on some of the strategies that
have been successfully used in the discovery of 14 new frameworks
during the period elapsed between the 14th and 15th edition of
the International Zeolite Conference [35]. These strategies include
the use of novel organic templates, the synthesis in F-media, the
introduction of alternative framework elements (Ge, Be), and in
some cases the use of high-throughput techniques for synthesis. A
ﬁnal approach for the synthesis of zeolites consists in the solid state
topotactic transformation of layered structures into zeolites. Again,
it is concluded that the commercial viability of a new structure will
be determined mainly by its unique performance and production
costs. We would like to highlight here a very interesting new avenue
that involves the synthesis of zeolites that were previously carried
out with organic structure directing agents, and can now be synthesized in an organic free synthesis media, though large amounts
of seeds have to be used [36–40].
The need for expanding the application of zeolite based catalysts to processes involving bulkier molecules, has lead to different
approaches into generation of larger pores and additional intraor intercrystalline mesoporosity [24,41,42]. After establishing new
starting hypothesis or after the synthesis of large libraries of organic
structure directing agents (OSDA), the use of high-throughput (HT)
synthesis techniques has been very useful for the discovery of
new structures or for the optimization of existing ones. In the
next section we will revise the application of high-throughput
techniques to zeolite synthesis, and how they have lead to the
discovery, among others, of a large number of extralarge pore zeolites.
2.1. Conventional vs. high-throughput systems for laboratory
zeolite synthesis
The synthesis of zeolites is inﬂuenced by a large number of
variables among which we can highlight different framework elements, mineralizing media, inorganic cations, and the use of organic
or inorganic SDAs [43]. Traditional laboratory synthesis studies
in which one variable is modiﬁed at a time, usually require long
times to explore large regions within the synthesis phase diagram.
Moreover, in the ﬁeld of zeolite synthesis the prediction of a zeolite structure to be obtained under certain synthesis conditions
cannot yet be achieved. Then, the application of high-throughput
(HT) synthesis techniques combined with data mining reduces the
screening time and optimizes the number of experiments to be conducted for exploring a given region of the synthesis diagram. Owing
to this, the number of synthesis variables that can be studied at a
higher level is larger, and this allows increasing the probabilities
of ﬁnding new materials, while achieving a better understanding of the crystallization mechanisms, providing that clear starting
hypothesis are made. Furthermore, the exploration of synthesis
conditions out of the conventional ranges used in traditional studies is enabled. From a more applied point of view, high-throughput
techniques may be useful for the search of alternative synthesis
methods with reduced costs, and the increased rate of experimental learning and discovery will reduce the time-to-market of new
or optimized catalyst technologies. In any case, the use of highthroughput strategies must never be considered as the substitute of
a well planned approach [44–46], but one should always follow the

scientiﬁc approach which can be now facilitated by the possibility
of producing a larger number of results [47–49].
HT experimentation combines different elements such as
the automated parallel synthesis of solids, the parallel physicochemical characterization, fast sequential testing of some of their
most interesting properties, and the use of data mining techniques
to maximize the information acquired [50–54].
The Syntef group published the ﬁrst report on a HT parallel zeolite synthesis in 1998 [55] and some years later Yu and co-workers
discovered new zinc phosphate structures by means of a combinatorial approach [56]. HT methods were employed by Corma et al.
for the discovery of zeolite ITQ-21, a very open 3-dimensional large
pore structure, in a ﬁrst approach [57], and for the optimization of
the synthesis procedure and ﬁne-tuning of crystallite size in a second stage [58,59]. ITQ-30 [60] and ITQ-24 [61] were also obtained
and their synthesis optimized by means of a rational design of HT
synthesis (Fig. 1) and characterization experiments, combined with
the use of data mining techniques. A few years later a powerful
data mining technique has been developed to be able to identify
each individual zeolite structure in a synthesis product that contains several crystalline structures and still amorphous material
[54,62].
Researchers from UOP have used the HT experimentation to
explore the combination of commercially available templates in
order to reduce the cost of potential new zeolite structures [63].
In this way zeolites UZM-4, UZM-8, UZM-15, UZM-17, or UZM-22,
among others, were discovered [64,65]. In a ﬁrst step a synthesis reaction mixture containing organoammonium hydroxides as
SDAs is prepared where the charges between the organic SDA and
potential framework to be formed are intentionally unbalanced.
The controlled addition of alkaline or alkaline earth cations at low
concentrations induces the crystallization of the structure, cooperating with the organic template.
In the last years the application of HT experimentation has led to
the discovery of many interesting zeolites: ITQ-32 [66], ITQ-33 [8],
ITQ-37 [9], ITQ-40 [10], ITQ-44 [67] or ITQ-47 [11]. ITQ-32 is a bidirectional zeolite with 8R pores connected by 12R channels which
can be prepared as a nearly pure silica zeolite and as aluminosilicate. Its pore topology exhibits a unidirectional small 8R channel
˚
system along the a-axis, with a pore aperture of 3.5 A˚ × 4.3 A,
crossed perpendicularly by short 12R channels with a diameter of
6.3 A˚ and 16.2 A˚ in length [66]. Zeolite ITQ-33 is a silicoaluminoger-

manate whose structure exhibits straight large pore channels with
circular openings of 18-rings along the c axis interconnected by
a bidirectional system of 10-ring channels (see Fig. 2). The highthroughput techniques used in that study allowed the identiﬁcation
of its synthesis conditions, which are easily accessible, but not typical [8].
The combination of its unique structure with the successful
incorporation of Al in framework positions resulted in an acid zeolite with interesting catalytic properties. When used for catalytic
cracking of a vacuum gasoil it was able to increase simultaneously
the yields to the highly valuable propylene and butenes and to the
diesel fraction [8,68], while decreasing the yield of gasoline.
The structure of ITQ-33 was already predicted by Foster and
Treacy by computational simulation as a thermodynamically feasible structure [69]. The same database predicted a zeolite topology
with a 18 × 12 × 12-R pore system containing double 3-ring units.
The synthesis of this structure has been recently achieved as a
silicogermanate (ITQ-44) by using a rigid, bulky and relatively
unexpensive SDA, working in ﬂuoride media and using HT synthesis
techniques [67]. ITQ-40, an extralarge pore zeolite containing D3Rs and D4-Rs has also been discovered recently [10]. Interestingly
the pore structure is formed by 15 × 16 × 16-member ring channels,
and has the lowest framework density of all existing 4-coordinated
oxide frameworks, 10.1 T atoms per 1000 A3 .
The systematic exploration of the phase diagrams of germanosilicates by high-throughput techniques using three large
dicationic organic structure directing agents was the key for discovering the new zeolite ITQ-37 [9]. ITQ-37 is a germanosilicate
zeolite with extralarge 30-ring windows and pore size dimension
within the mesoporous range, and it is the ﬁrst chiral zeolite with
a single gyroidal channel.
As we have seen, HT experimentation has demonstrated to be a
powerful technique in zeolite synthesis research and is expected to
be increasingly implemented in most laboratories working in this
ﬁeld.
2.2. Role of structure directing agents
Organic cations were ﬁrst introduced in the zeolite synthesis by
Barrera and Denny [70], with the aim of increasing the Si/Al ratio
of the ﬁnal materials. In this way ZSM-5 and beta, deﬁned as highsilica zeolites, were obtained [71,72]. Since then the introduction of
organic templates has been one of the main drivers in the synthesis of new zeolite structures [35,73], especially when the synthesis
of high silica materials or aluminophosphates were the objective,
and an historical revision on the trends in the use of organic structure directing agents (OSDA) in zeolite synthesis has been recently
published by Burton and Zones [74].
While important advances have been made, the exact role of the
SDA in the zeolite synthesis is not yet fully understood. The encap-

sulation within the microporous structure points out to, at least,
some control on pore architecture and stabilization of the system,
due to weak as well as electrostatic interactions between the framework and the occluded organic species. However, in general, SDAs
are not as speciﬁc as expected, and the same organic molecule can
lead to different zeolite structures depending on the experimental
conditions [75]. It is known that, besides the inﬂuence of the SDA,
the presence of certain inorganic cations (alkalines, Zn, B, Ge) in
the synthesis gel, or the use of ﬂuoride anions as silica mobilizing
agents, can also direct certain structural features, and will therefore
promote speciﬁc structures.
A nice example of how the use of organic molecules can help
increasing the Si/Al ratio of a certain zeolite is the evolution of zeolite A (LTA). Traditionally, this zeolite was synthesized with a Si/Al
ratio of 1. The incorporation of TMA increased the ratio to values
of 3 and by combination of TMA with the bulkier tetraethylammonium cations, UOP researchers synthesized UZM-9, a LTA structure
with Si/Al ratio up to 9 [74]. Recently a LTA Ge-containing zeolite with a (Si + Ge)/Al ratio of 80, as well as the pure silica and
Ge free LTA structure, has been synthesized in ﬂuoride media and
has been named zeolite ITQ-29 [76]. Interestingly, a rigid multicyclic quaternary ammonium compound was used as SDA that is
able to self-assembly in solution forming a supramolecular complex, which ﬁts perfectly within the alpha-cage of the LTA structure
(see Fig. 3).
When TMA cations, which stabilized the sodalite units and also
balanced the charge excess due to the ﬂuoride anions within the
D4R, were added to the synthesis media together with the bulkier
OSDA, the pure silica LTA zeolite (ITQ-29) was produced. One of
the most interesting applications of this Al free LTA, highly stable
and hydrophobic, could be gas separation in the presence of H2 O
or other polar molecules [76].
The use of phosphonium (instead of ammonium) based OSDA
has allowed the synthesis of new structures (ITQ-27 [77], ITQ-34
[78]). Moreover, the use of phosphazenes has allowed the synthesis of the elusive Boggsite zeolite [11]. This material (ITQ-47),
known up to now only in its natural form, presents a bidirectional microporous channel system formed by 10 and 12MR pores.
The use of P-containing SDA has also enabled the improvement of
the synthesis of ITQ-27, increasing the range of Si/Al ratio possible [79]. Moreover, the P stabilizes the zeolite structure towards
hydrothermal treatment simulating regeneration conditions during FCC process [80].
The group of Morris has recently presented the synthesis of
zeolites and other microporous materials in ionothermal media
[81–84], and a complete review on this topic can be found in [85]. It
is presented that the ionic liquids can play a double role, as solvent
and as SDA.
Initially only ALPO materials could be obtained following this
procedure (see Fig. 4 for some of the structured obtained), due to

the limited solubility of the silica precursors, which is below the
required for the synthesis of silico-aluminates. Recently this group
succeeded in the synthesis of pure silica TON and MFI zeolites in
an ionic liquid media by adding bromide–hydroxide, that increases
the solubility of the silica precursors and enables zeolite crystallization in reasonable times. The use of ionic liquids as solvents
allows high temperatures at ambient pressures. However, due to

the high temperatures used, the ionic liquid can decompose, and
the decomposition products may play a decisive role for the synthesis, as described in [82]. Regardless of economic issues, the use
of synthesis media others than water may open the possibility for
new microporous structures to be discovered.
The cooperative structure directing effects in the synthesis of
crystalline molecular sieves when using more than one template
has been recently reviewed by Pérez-Pariente et al. [86]. His group
has explored the combination of bulky and small SDAs for modifying the accessibility of the Brönsted acid sites in ferrierites.
When using 1-benzyl-1-methylpyrrolidium (bmp) and the cage
forming TMA (see Fig. 5) they observed both molecules participate simultaneously in the crystallization of the FER structure
[87–89].
Moreover, varying the combination of TMA, pyrrolidine and
bmp results in different distribution of the bridging hydroxyls
responsible for the catalytic activity [90] located in the ferrierite
cage, accessible through 8MR windows, and the 10MR channels. Accessibility of the active acid sites was measured by FT-IR
combined with pyridine adsorption, and the implications on the
catalytic activity have been indicated.
UOP researchers have described that the cooperative templating
between a large organocation with low charge density and a small
organocation with high charge density (TMA) enables the synthesis
of zeolites with lower Si/Al ratios. This concept is known as the
charge density mismatch [91].
Another approach presented by Lee et al. [92,93] is the use of
ketal-containing SDA. These molecules can be disassembled and
reassembled easily enabling their removal from the microporous
structure without the need of calcination (see Fig. 6).
The SDA molecule occluded in the zeolite structure is chemically
cleaved into fragments that can be extracted from the microporous
channel system and ﬁnally recombined to form the original SDA.
This general methodology has proven to be adequate for the synthesis of ZSM-5, VPI-8, and ZSM-12.
Organic functionalization of microporous zeolites for broadening the diversity of catalytic active and shape selective sites is not
straightforward. In fact, if the organic functions are incorporated
by post-synthesis graphting, most of them will be located at the
external surface of the crystals, and will therefore present no shape
selectivity. Jones et al. developed in the late 1990s a direct synthesis

method for obtaining organic-functionalized molecular sieves
(OFMSs) with BEA structure [94–97]. The OFMSs were prepared
using tetraethylammonium ﬂuoride as SDA, and different functional groups (phenethyl, cyanoethyl, iodopropyl, bromopropyl,
allyl, dimethylaminopropyl, and mercaptopropyl) were covalently
bonded to framework silicon atoms by adding the corresponding
organosilane into the zeolite synthesis gel. When evaluating the
catalytic behavior of these type of materials, two competing effects
have to be considered: the activity will be proportional to the number of active sites, but an increase of the active organic functions
will result in increasing diffusional limitations [97].
The possibility for preparing zeolite single layers was demonstrated by delaminating layered precursors of zeolites by means of
post-synthesis treatments (see Fig. 7). In this way zeolites ITQ-2
[20,98], ITQ-6 [99,100], ITQ-18 [101] and ITQ-20 [102] have been
prepared. The resultant zeolitic materials showed very high accessible surface areas and interesting catalytic properties for a large
number of acid catalyzed reactions [103–111].
Moreover, the single layers have been used to form hybrid
organic–inorganic materials, as shown in Fig. 8, with a combination
of micro- and mesopores that allow the preparation of bifunctional
acid–base catalysts [112].
Very recently Ryoo et al. have obtained single layers of
zeolite ZSM-5 by direct synthesis. This has been achieved
by using large organic molecules with diquaternary ammo-

nium groups located at the end of the chain. Indeed,
C22 H45 –N1(CH3 )2 –C6 H12 –N1(CH3 )2 –C6 H13 is composed of a longchain alkyl group (C22 ) and two quaternary ammonium groups
spaced by a C6 alkyl linkage. The cationic groups act as SDAs to
crystallize the ZSM-5 monolayers and the long hydrophobic chain
limits their growth along the “b” direction, as shown in Fig. 9 [13].
2.3. Considerations for large scale commercial zeolite synthesis
Zones has recently presented a number of issues that need to
be taking into account before considering a zeolite commercialization [113]. First, if organic SDA molecules are used, their price
and their possible risks from the environmental and health point of
view have to be considered. Safety issues on equipments and products are also important. Concerning the synthesis process itself, for
commercial scale production of zeolites, synthesis time and postsynthesis steps have to be carefully evaluated. Finally, the waste
streams generated and their possible treatment must be taken into
account.
Schmidt [114] has presented a nice overview on the development of new technologies for solid catalysts preparation, including
zeolite based catalysts, and their potential implementation from
an industrial perspective. According to his analysis, the catalyst
industry, which was technology driven, has become more and more
dependent on cost, and cost reduction can be a limiting factor for
both, manufacturer and catalyst user. The development of new
production technologies involves high risks and important capital investment, and will only be considered if the beneﬁts, from a
performance, cost or environmental point of view are clear. On the
contrary, the efforts will be directed to the improvement of existing
technologies.
Some important advances have been achieved recently in zeolite
synthesis that can reduce costs of known materials and/or facilitate the industrial application of other zeolites. The most relevant
approaches are listed below:
- Organic-free zeolite synthesis. Some zeolites synthesized in the
absence of OSDA are ZSM-34 [36,38], ZSM-12 [39], ECR-1 or beta
[37,40]. A second generation of organotemplate-free beta has
been presented recently (IZC-IMMS 2010) as “Green Beta”. The
difference, as compared to the ﬁrst generation, is that the beta
seeds used here are also organic-free.
- Low efﬂuent or dry hydrothermal synthesis. The main advantage
of this procedure is the non-generation of a mother-liquor. However, if organics are used for the synthesis, they will be difﬁcult to

1564

recover for recycling unless a washing or extraction step is performed, and then the main beneﬁt of the method is lost. Moreover,
manipulation of the dry paste and homogeneization of the temperature proﬁle during the synthesis are serious drawbacks for
a large-scale commercial application. More details can be found
in [114]. Hari Prasad Rao et al. described the preparation of high
silica Beta zeolite by this procedure [115].
- Zeolite bound zeolites. Here an appropriate binder, mesoporous
silica–alumina, is transformed into a zeolite via a secondary
synthesis [116,117]. This novel procedure, assigned to Lummus Technology, has been demonstrated for some of the most
demanded zeolites in the catalysts and adsorbents industry, e.g.
beta, ZSM-5, mordenite, X, Y and A [118].
- Microwave zeolite synthesis [119,120]. The use of microwave
heating results in energy and synthesis time savings.
- Zeolite synthesis using degradable structure-directing agents and
pore-ﬁlling agents [92,93]. This approach, already presented in

the previous section, opens potential lower cost synthesis routes,
as the expensive SDA molecules can be totally recovered under
mild conditions and without the generation of harmful waste
streams.
- Low cost zeolite production using waste ﬂy ash or biomass ash
as silica and/or alumina sources: ashes from different sources,
such as ﬂy ash during coal combustion or biomass ash, such as
the one obtained by combustion of rice hull, will differ in their
composition not only because of their different origin, but also
depending on the combustion conditions [121,122]. However,
they are all rich in silica and alumina, present as amorphous
and/or crystalline phases and usually also contain Na. These solid
waste products have been used as silica and alumina precursors
for zeolites when dissolved in basic media, and single phases of
zeolites A, X, Y, P1 and ZSM-5 have been described. However,
none of the procedures described has found large scale application. One of the main drawbacks is that the complete conversion
of ash into the crystalline zeolite is not achieved. Dissolution
of the Si and Al precursors and crystallization of the zeolite are
simultaneous processes, and the formation of zeolite crystals on
the ash particles can limit further reaction. Moreover, ﬂy ash is
usually processed without prior puriﬁcation, and remaining coal
and impurities such as Fe2 O3 may contaminate the ﬁnal zeolitic
product.
3. Post-synthesis modiﬁcation of inorganic molecular
sieves

Two very complete compilations on the most employed postsynthesis modiﬁcations of zeolites are given by Kúhl [123] and
Szostak [124]. In a more recent study [125], Chen and Zones include
two additional modiﬁcation procedures: the substitution of the
original T-atoms present in the as synthesized zeolite, such as B, by
the desired atoms, usually Al or Si [126,127], and the preparation
of highly crystalline hydrophobic pure-silica zeolites, such as CIT-1
and SSZ-33, by means of post-synthesis treatment of borosilicate
zeolites with acetic acid [128].
Most of the zeolites in their as-synthesized form are not active,
as their microporous structure is ﬁlled with organic molecules
and/or inorganic species that will have to be removed by calcination
or extraction of the organic agents or by ion-exchange procedures
as in the case of substitution of alkaline cations by the active

protons. These procedures can be enclosed in a ﬁrst group of treatments that are necessary to activate the zeolite. Other modiﬁcations
are directed to improve the thermal and hydrothermal stability of
the framework, for example by dealumination of low Si/Al zeolites. A clear example is the ultrastabilization of the Y zeolite used
as active component in catalytic cracking and hydrocracking processes [129]. The objective may also be to increase the accessibility
to the active sites by generation of mesoporosity. Traditionally this
has been achieved by combination of hydrothermal treatments and
acid leaching, but in the last years alternative treatments in basic
media have been presented to generate mesoporosity in high silica
zeolites [130–134]. An extensive review on this subject has been
recently published [42].
Sometimes the aim of the post-synthesis modiﬁcation is to
remove non-selective active sites located close to or at the external
surface of the zeolite crystallites by selectivation processes. This can
be achieved by dealumination of the external surface by treating the
zeolite with bulky acids, such as oxalic acid, or by means of complexing agents such as EDTA, while acid treatment with stronger
acids can be performed with the as synthesized zeolite when it
still contains the organic inside of the channels. Selective coking is
another option, used for example by Exxon-Mobil Chemicals and
Shell for selective toluene desproportionation and production of
i-butene from 1-butene, respectively. Most of these selectivation
procedures have also been described in the early patent literature
for oligomerization of light oleﬁns to high cetane diesel [135,136].
The chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of silica on medium pore
zeolites is also used for decreasing the number of non-selective
external active sites and for regulating the size of the pore openings, improving in this way the para-selectivity in the production of
di-substituted aromatics [137–140], or decreasing the deactivation
rate in methane dehydroaromaization [141].
The activity of a catalyst can be greatly enhanced by ﬁne-tuning
the hydrophobic–hydrophilic nature of the material. In this line,
important beneﬁts have been observed by silylation of Ti-micro and
mesoporous materials for oleﬁn epoxidation catalysts. Silylation
of the external surface results in a more hydrophobic catalyst and
inhibits the undesired ring-opening of the epoxide [142,143].
Besides the functionalization of the external surface of molecular sieves, as described above, the internal surface of pure silica

MFI has been functionalized by post-synthesis surface treatments
with methanol [144,145] or larger alcohols [146]. In the case of
methanol it was suggested to be located in the zeolite structure
bonded through ≡Si–O–CH3 linkages [147], and its presence had a
limited effect on the properties of the host zeolite due to the small
size of the methyl group. When functionalizing with 1-butanol
and 1-hexanol, the characterization results conﬁrmed the covalent bonding of these molecules almost exclusively to the internal
silanol defect sites. Thus, using organic alcohols of different sizes
will lead to hybrid materials with different pore properties [146].
4. Catalyst conformation for industrial use
As detailed by Bartholomew and Farrauto in [148], commercial heterogeneous catalysts are chemically and physically complex
materials, and their development is a highly multidisciplinary
task that requires inputs from chemistry, chemical engineering,
material science and physics. In its ﬁnal state, the catalyst has
to accomplish speciﬁc dynamic properties which include: activity, selectivity, structure, surface composition or state of the active
phase, and physical properties regarding its texture, density and
mechanical stability.
A typical heterogeneous catalyst contains three components: an
active catalytic phase, a promoter and a high surface area carrier
or support. In the case of zeolitic catalysts the active phase can be
the zeolite itself, and/or it can be used as a support for a second
catalytic function.
Before forming the zeolite based catalyst it is necessary to synthesize, modify and activate the zeolite, and then combine it with
the rest of the catalyst components. The next step in the catalyst
manufacture involves shaping the components into microspheres,
pellets or extrudates, among others. This can be the ﬁnal process in
catalyst manufacture, unless an additional catalytic function has to
be later incorporated, for instance, by impregnation. The morphology of the ﬁnal catalyst particle, i.e. size, shape, porosity, active
site distribution, is determinant for the intrinsic reaction kinetics
and for the diffusion rates of reactants and products, and it is generally marked by the type of reactor used [149]. Thus, ﬁxed bed
reactors require large particles (1–5 mm) in order to minimize the
pressure drop along the reactor, and the particles must have a high

1566

C. Martínez, A. Corma / Coordination Chemistry Reviews 255 (2011) 1558–1580

mechanical resistance. Pellets, rings and extrudates are commonly
used here. In this case it is important to optimize the surface-overvolume ratio in order to minimize diffusional problems, and this can
be done by varying the shape of the particles (cylinders, trilobes,
hollow extrudates or rings, among others). Spheres (1–3 mm) are
used for moving bed applications, and microspheres (40–100 ␮m)
are the choice for ﬂuidized bed or transported reactors. Having
the adequate mechanical transport properties and attrition resistance is essential in all cases. Finally, monolithic catalysts are used
in processes where it is crucial to maintain a low pressure drop
while working with high ﬂows of gases. Monoliths are continuous
structures formed by parallel channels of 1–3 mm in diameter. The
support is usually a ceramic or metallic material and is coated with
a layer containing the active components. It is possible to vary the
shape of the channels, and the monolith structure can be adapted
to ﬁt in the reaction chamber [149]. One of the most important
applications based on monolithic catalysts is in the cleaning of automotive exhaust gases. More applications can be found in [149], and
the importance of the ﬁnal shaping step in large-scale use of zeolite
based catalysts is also highlighted in [150].
5. Commercial processes based on inorganic molecular
sieve catalysts
An interesting overview of the industrial relevance of zeolites
and their use as heterogeneous catalysts, especially within reﬁning
and petrochemical processes, is given in [150]. Most of the zeolites used in catalytic processes are applied in this ﬁeld, and other
thorough revisions on this topic have also been published recently
[2,25,32,151,152]. Here we will broaden the revision including
applications in the ﬁeld of chemicals and ﬁne chemicals, in conversion of alternative energy sources such as natural gas or biomass,
and in the treatment of emissions coming from stationary and
mobile sources.
5.1. Oil reﬁning
5.1.1. Fluid catalytic cracking
Fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) is the largest and oldest industrial
application of zeolite based catalysts. The FCC unit is still a main
conversion unit in many reﬁneries, which is able to process very
large amounts of heavy oil fractions. It is able to direct the production preferentially to gasoline, diesel (LCO), or it can maximize
propylene, with minor modiﬁcations of the unit or in the operating conditions [153], thanks to the ﬂexibility achieved with the FCC
catalyst additives. The importance of zeolite based catalysts in FCC
has been remarked in several recent revisions [2,152,154].
5.1.1.1. Zeolite based FCC catalysts. Zeolite Y replaced amorphous
silica–alumina as the active component of FCC catalysts in the
early 1960s, and has been successfully used since then. This zeolite,
however, has been progressively improved in order to increase its
activity and selectivity and to adapt the production to the desired
products. Stabilization and ultra-stabilization of zeolite Y by introduction of rare-earths, dealumination by hydrothermal treatments
combined with acid leaching, or combination of the two former
procedures are well known procedures in the State of the Art. Phosphorus treatment of Y zeolite has also been claimed to increase its
stability [155,156]. New zeolites with increasing pore size (>12MR),
stable in FCC conditions, have been proposed for bottoms cracking.
Some of them are ZSM-20 [157,158], or ITQ-21, with pore sizes in
the range of those of the conventionally used Y zeolite but with
a more open structure, which results in a higher oleﬁnicity of the
LPG obtained [57,159]. ITQ-33, with intersecting extra-large 18MR
˚ and 10MR channels [68], is an interesting zeolite
pores (12.2 A)
able to increase simultaneously the yields to propylene and diesel,

by a very peculiar molecular trafﬁc control phenomena (Table 1).
Unfortunately, the application of these new materials is limited in
practice due to their still reduced hydrothermal stability and high
production cost.
It should be remarked here that zeolites were introduced,
instead of amorphous silica–alumina, mainly because their higher
activity and selectivity to gasoline. However, the higher demand for
diesel in several reﬁneries in Europe may again chain the paradigm
into more “amorphous” catalysts, i.e. catalysts containing more
amorphous active matrix and less zeolite.
5.1.1.2. Zeolite based FCC additives. ZSM-5 containing additives are
co-fed to the FCC unit in order to increase the yield of propylene and butenes, mostly at the cost of gasoline yield, but with a
remarkable gain in gasoline octane. The medium pore ZSM-5 zeolite converts the linear and monobranched alkenes (as well as some
alkanes) present in the gasoline fraction to light oleﬁns, enriching
the remaining gasoline in aromatics and isopentenes. Hydrothermal stability of ZSM-5 is an important issue, and has been improved
by modiﬁcation with phosphorus, as shown in Fig. 10 [160–164].
Other medium pore zeolites studied as FCC additives are MCM22 [165], ITQ-13 [61], IM-5 [166] and TNU-9 [167]. The increase in
LPG yield and its oleﬁnicity is in good agreement with their speciﬁc
pore topologies and dimensions. Large pore zeolites such as Beta
or ITQ-7 have also been proposed as FCC additives with the aim
of increasing overall butenes [168], isobutane [14] or isobutene
and amylenes yields [169]. Although cost requirements are less
stringent in the case of additives, the use of expensive organics or
heteroatoms remain important drawbacks for commercial application of these new materials.
Besides the improvement of the FCC catalyst and additives,
many efforts are directed to improve the design of the FCC unit,
most of them regarding feed injection, stripper efﬁciency and catalyst recirculation. In all cases the trend is to adapt the units for
processing different type of feeds and for ﬂexible production, from
distillate and fuel oils, to blend stocks for high octane gasoline or
LPG and light oleﬁns for petrochemicals and gasoline processes.
5.1.2. Hydrocracking
Hydrocracking is a highly versatile key process in modern reﬁnery schemes, which enables the conversion of a wide variety of lowquality feedstocks such as atmospheric gas oils, vacuum gas oils,
and heavier residues into lighter high-value added products, mainly
transportation fuels. This permits the adjustments of product

speciﬁcations according to the new and stringent legislative
requirements. In addition, during hydrocracking operation sulfur
and nitrogen-containing compounds are removed and saturation
of aromatics is also accomplished. The increasing diesel demand
since year 2000, especially in Europe, has led to rebalance the reﬁnery product distribution, and consequently, the long term desire
would be to increase the number of hydrocracking units, especially for processing very heavy fractions, such as for instance
Athabasca bitumen’s or the very heavy products with high C/H
ratios present in the Orinoco belt. Although hydrocracking units
require large investments they can be a better option than thermal
cocking for processing very heavy crudes, as has been demonstrated by ENI with its Slurry Technology [170–174]. More details
on the importance of zeolites as hydrocracking catalysts have been
recently given by Rigutto [154], Perego and Carati [2] and Corma
and Martínez [175].
Hydrocracking catalysts are bifunctional catalysts, comprising
an acid and a hydrogenation–dehydrogenation function. According to their acid function they can be classiﬁed into zeolitic and
non zeolitic catalysts. The non zeolitic catalysts are mainly formed
by alumina and silica–alumina, and the zeolite based hydrocracking catalysts are grouped into low zeolite and high zeolite content
catalysts. The zeolite is combined with amorphous silica–alumina
in the ﬁrst case, and with alumina, as binder and support, in the
second case.
The zeolites used in hydrocracking conversion units are ultrastable Y zeolites (USY), and their activity and selectivity to the
different fractions (gases, naphtha, kerosene, diesel) will be determined by their acid properties, which are directly related to the
framework (Si/Al) and extraframework Al content, and by their textural properties (micro and mesoporosity). These properties can
be modiﬁed and adjusted through catalyst preparation. Regarding
the hydrogenation–dehydrogenation function, it will be different
according to the sulfur level of the feed. A noble metal, such as Pt,
is used when processing low sulfur feeds as in the second stage
hydrocracking unit. Transition metal sulﬁdes are used for hydroconverting feeds with higher sulfur concentrations.
The zeolite-based hydrocracking catalysts are more active and
more stable towards deactivation by coking or by basic nitrogen
compounds than amorphous-based catalysts [176]. Their higher
activity allows operating the unit at lower temperature, condition that favors aromatics hydrogenation, and therefore increases
the quality of the middle distillates (higher cetane). On the other
hand, they are less selective to middle distillates, as their conversion into naphtha and gases is favored on the stronger acid sites
[177]. Therefore, and from the point of view of maximizing middle

distillates, it would be highly desirable to design hydrocracking catalysts that combine the good activity of the zeolite based
catalysts with the high selectivity obtained with the amorphous
silica–alumina. Thus, zeolite type materials with higher accessibility have been proposed in the literature, such as the very open
zeolite ITQ-21 [178], nanocrystalline beta [179] or delaminated
ITQ-2 [180] and clear beneﬁts were obtained, not only from the
selectivity but also from hydrocracking and hydrodesulfurization
activity point of view (see Fig. 11 and Table 2).
Other large pore zeolites, such as ZSM-20 [181–183] or SAPO-37
[184,185] have also been claimed as hydrocracking catalysts. However, due to stability and economical factors, at present, zeolitic

commercial hydrocracking catalysts are based on zeolite Y. Modiﬁcation of the zeolite’s properties provides some ﬂexibility according
to the product distribution but, in the last years, there has been
an increasing trend in using multi-component catalysts, where the
acidic zeolite is combined with amorphous silica alumina (ASA) and
an alumina binder. In this way, the alumina binder will enhance
NiMo dispersion, the ASA will convert the larger molecules of the
feed, and the zeolite will process the lighter fractions and the
products obtained on the amorphous components of the catalyst
[186,187]. Already in the early 1990s, John Ward (Union Oil) presented interesting results obtained when using combinations of Y
with amorphous silica–magnesia as hydrocracking catalysts, and
claimed the beneﬁts in yields to middle distillates obtained by
diluting the zeolite component [188].
Following a similar concept, a multizone hydrocracking process has been described where catalysts with different composition
and/or shapes are placed in several consecutive reaction zones
[189–194].
As in the case of FCC, the need for hydroprocessing heavier conventional feeds or unconventional crudes (tar sands, shale
oils) require the improvement of existing technologies or the
development of alternative strategies. The beneﬁts of generating mesopores in Y zeolite as hydroprocessing catalyst have been
largely described [130,131,195–197], and the combination of wellknown procedures such as hydrothermal treatment-acid leaching
with controlled desilication procedures has been proposed to be
very advantageous (see the pore structures of the modiﬁed samples
presented in Fig. 12), due to the improved diffusion properties of the
ﬁnal material [198]. Operation in reactors different from conventional ﬁxed bed systems, such as ebullating beds or slurry reactors
are alternative proposals [150].
Recently a new hydrocracking technology for heavy feeds has
been presented by ENI that combines molybdenum nanoparticles
and FCC equilibrium catalysts [170–174].

5.1.3. Catalytic dewaxing by cracking and alkane isomerization
Long chain n-parafﬁns are waxy compounds which can precipitate at low temperatures, providing lube oils and fuels with
highly undesired cold properties (pour point, freezing point, cloud
point). In the late 1960s and early 1970s catalytic dewaxing based
on zeolites replaced the existing solvent dewaxing processes in
the reﬁning industry. These early zeolitic catalysts, in most cases
medium pore molecular sieves, based their performance on their
acid and shape selective properties. However, the ﬁrst zeolite based
bi-functional catalyst was proposed by BP, and involved a Pt/HMordenite [200]. Several years later, Mobil presented a ZSM-5
based catalyst [201], in where the lineal alkane were selectively
cracked with respect to branched ones. This is a clear example of
reactant shape selectivity.
In the last decades a dewaxing process was introduced by
Chevron (IsodewaxingTM ) that combines selective hydrocracking
with hydroisomerization, achieving in this way not only a reduction of the pour point, but also improved ﬂow properties. A catalyst
was proposed which contains SAPO-11 that favors isomerization,
instead of cracking, of the waxy parafﬁns [202,203]. Exxon-Mobil
has developed its Mobil Isomerization Dewaxing process (MIDW)
based on a bifunctional noble metal-molecular sieve proprietary
catalyst. According to Perego [204] the process involves two isomerization steps, one with a beta zeolite, and a second step with
a monodimensional medium pore zeolite, such as ZSM-22. Different zeolitic structures have been compared for hydroisomerization
of n-octane in [205] and the inﬂuence of the structure has been
extrapolated to its potential behavior for dewaxing by isomerization. More details on the use of zeolites for dewaxing and dewaxing
by isomerization can be found in [152,204,206].

5.1.4. Production of aromatics
5.1.4.1. Non-oxidative conversion of methane to aromatics. Valorization of methane, the major component of natural gas, by its direct
conversion into high value products, such as chemicals or fuels,
is still one of the main challenges in heterogeneous catalysis. An
attractive approach is the non-oxidative conversion of methane,
which has been recently overviewed in several reviews and papers
[207–212]. Despite the low conversions obtained due to thermodynamic limitations, the selectivity to benzene, the desired product,
is high, and an effective separation of hydrogen during the reaction
may shift the equilibrium towards the aromatic products.
The methane dehydroaromatization (MDA) was ﬁrst presented
by Wang et al. in 1993. The catalyst proposed for this process was
a bifunctional Mo/H-ZSM-5, and the reaction was performed in the
absence of oxygen at 700 ◦ C and atmospheric pressure.
Mo, initially present as MoO3 , is converted during the reaction
to a carbide-species and is involved in the dehydrogenation steps,
while the zeolite acid sites catalyze cracking, oligomerization,
and cyclization reactions. Although this concept of bifunctional

C. Martínez, A. Corma / Coordination Chemistry Reviews 255 (2011) 1558–1580

activity and product yields for methane dehydroaromatization
obtained with a conventional MCM-22 is compared with that given
by nestlike hollow hierarchical MCM-22 microspheres [215].
The non-oxidative catalytic conversion of methane is usually
carried out at 700 ◦ C (or higher) applying plug-ﬂow hydrodynamics in a continuous ﬂow system under atmospheric pressure (or
slightly higher) and in the absence of oxygen. The reaction is limited by thermodynamic equilibrium (maximum conversion of 12%
at 700 ◦ C). Increasing the temperature increases the formation of
polyaromatics, coking and the difﬁculty of regeneration. The use
membrane reactors has been proposed as a possible solution to
overcome equilibrium limitations and application of measures to
reduce deactivation.
5.1.4.2. Aromatization of short (C2–C4) alkanes. The industrial conversion of short C2–C4 alkanes (LPG) into aromatics, mainly
benzene, toluene and xylenes (BTX), uses a zeolite based catalyst.
The overall process can be described as a dehydrocyclodimerization, and is thermodynamically favored at temperatures above
425 ◦ C. The rate determining step is the dehydrogenation of the
light parafﬁns. The oleﬁns formed are highly reactive and oligomerize to larger intermediates which then cyclize to naphthenes.
Finally the naphthenes are dehydrogenated to aromatics. One additional advantage of this process is the generation of large amounts
of H2 , a high value by-product that can be further used in other
reﬁning or petrochemical units. One of the commercial aromatization processes is the Cyclar process developed jointly by BP
and UOP, which employs a bifunctional Ga/HZSM-5 catalyst [217].
Typically, the optimum performance is obtained with catalysts containing 1–5 wt% Ga and Si/Al ratios in the range of 15–30, yielding
about 65% aromatics and 5% hydrogen.

performance is generally accepted, details on the possible reaction
mechanisms, as well as on the nature and role of the carbonaceous
deposits formed during the course of the reaction are still not fully
understood, and clear relationships between the nature of the catalyst and its performance have not yet been discovered. In all cases,
an induction period is observed at the early stage of the reaction,
probably related to the reduction of the MoOx species by methane
into Mo-carbide and/or Mo-oxocarbide species. During this period
only coke and gaseous products (CO, H2 O, H2 and CO) are observed,
with very little hydrocarbon formation. Thus, coking of the catalyst
occurs during the reaction, leading to a severe activity loss, and
this deactivation rate will be greatly inﬂuenced by the pore architecture and the acidity of the catalyst. Studies on the effect of the
Si/Al ratio of ZSM-5 or ITQ-2 zeolites on activity and selectivity have
been carried out by Martínez et al. in [213,214], respectively. It was
found that rate of aromatics formation increased when decreasing
Si/Al ratio, but maximum selectivity to benzene was obtained at
intermediate values, and improved when dealuminating the external surface. Some recent papers present the superior performance
of zeolites with hierarchical structures containing mesoporosity
[215,216]. The beneﬁts of these type of structures are a higher
catalytic activity due to better Mo dispersion, a higher selectivity
to benzene and a lower deactivation rate and increased catalyst
lifetime, due to an easier and faster diffusion of larger molecules.
This improved catalytic performance is illustrated in Fig. 13, where

5.1.4.3. Catalytic reforming of naphtha. Although the former processes for aromatics production are gaining interest, most of the
aromatics are obtained today by catalytic reforming of low octane
n-alkanes and cycloalkanes present in the petroleum naphtha. Catalytic reforming process results in the production of high octane
gasoline, hydrogen and BTX aromatics, and is present in almost 70%
of all reﬁneries [218]. For instance, the Aromax process, commercialized by Chevron, produces high yields of BTX from parafﬁnic
naphthas (C6–C8) by means of a Pt containing L zeolite [219]. At
present, some reforming technologies are combined with other
processes to upgrade the primary reforming products. For example
benzene and toluene, whose concentrations are limited in the ﬁnal
gasoline pool, are alkylated with the oleﬁns produced by cracking
during the process. The beneﬁt is double, as octane number and
liquid yield increase, due to a lower gas production. Following this
approach, Exxon-Mobil proposes the BTXtra process and the Benzene Reduction (MBR) process based on a ZSM-5 containing catalyst
[220]. A deeper insight into catalytic reforming processes can be
found in [152,204].
5.1.5. Isomerization processes
The isomerization process is equilibrium limited, and the formation of the branched isomers is thermodynamically favored at lower
reaction temperatures. Thus, highly active catalysts are needed to
achieve higher branching degree at lower temperatures, especially
when converting n-alkanes. A large number of the current commercial processes use chlorinated Pt/Al2 O3 , a catalyst that requieres the
continuous addition of chlorine during the process. Nevertheless,
an important number of units use a zeolite based bifunctional catalyst that avoids the use of chlorine derived additives and is more
resistant to the presence of sulfur in the feed. Other strong solid
acid catalysts such as modiﬁed zirconias and heteropolyacids have
been sought with the aim of operating at lower temperatures than
zeolites [221], but their implementation, if any, is very limited.

5.1.5.1. Isomerization of light straight run (LSR) naphtha. The isomerization of light naphtha fractions has gained importance in
the last decades due to the new gasoline speciﬁcations, and the
demand for isomerate as high octane blending component for the
gasoline pool is expected to grow. Isomerate is an environmentally
clean stream, free of aromatics, sulfur and oleﬁns, and it can be
obtained with relatively low investment costs. Moreover, the levels
of benzene are signiﬁcantly reduced in most of the isomerization
processes.
Chlorinated alumina catalysts, although more active than the
zeolite based catalysts, present the additional disadvantage of
being highly sensitive to all kinds of feed contaminants, especially water and sulfur. Zeolitic catalysts are much more tolerant to
these feedstock poisons, and this higher tolerance often compensates their lower activity. This was the basis for the development
of Süd-Chemie’s HYSOPAR® catalyst and the CKS ISOM process,
jointly offered by CEPSA, KBR and Süd-Chemie for light naphtha isomerization [222–224]. HYSOPAR is a platinum containing
modiﬁed mordenite that can operate commercially at sulfur levels exceeding 50 ppm [225]. It was applied commercially for the
ﬁrst time in a light naphtha isomerization plant of CEPSA’s reﬁnery in Algeciras (Spain) in 1993. Since then the catalyst has only
been replaced twice, and actually more than 20 reﬁneries around
the world employ this robust catalyst. UOP commercializes several light naphtha isomerization technologies, the PenexTM and the
Par-IsomTM processes, based on non-zeolitic catalysts, and their
Zeolitic isomerization process, which uses a platinum containing
mordenite catalyst.
5.1.5.2. Skeletal isomerization of linear butenes. Skeletal isomerization of light oleﬁns to isobutylene and isoamylenes produces
suitable feedstock for MTBE and TAME units or for the production of trimethylpentanes. The ISOMPLUSTM process is a ﬁxed bed
skeletal oleﬁn isomerization technology for converting n-butenes
and n-pentenes to isobutylene and isoamylenes, respectively. In
both cases a zeolite based catalyst is used [226] (Reﬁning Processes
2006), which, according to Rossini [227], is a non modiﬁed ferrierite
[228–230]. The feedstocks can be processed without steam or other
diluents, and the addition of catalyst activation agents to promote
the reaction is unnecessary.
Ferrierite, although modiﬁed, is also used as oleﬁn skeletal isomerization catalyst in the Isotex process by Texaco [231–234].
Together with ferrierite, alumina modiﬁed materials are also used
as catalysts in C4–C5 oleﬁns oligomerization, as for instance in the
SISP process by Snamprogetti [235,236].
5.1.6. Isobutane/butene alkylation
Alkylation processes are well known and widely used in the
reﬁning industry. In the case of isobutane/butene alkylation, the
objective is to obtain high octane gasoline fractions [237,238], and
the process is carried out in the presence of an acid catalyst.
The alkylate product is an ideal blending component for the
gasoline pool, as it is sulfur, oleﬁn and aromatic free, and contains exclusively high octane, low vapor pressure branched alkane
compounds. Currently, industrial alkylation processes use liquid
acids, i.e. HF and H2 SO4 , as catalysts [237,239,240]. In both cases
the main problems are related to corrosion, transport and handling,
and environmental risk related to the disposal of spent acid [241].
Undoubtedly, the substitution of these liquid acids by heterogeneous, environmentally more friendly solid acid catalysts is highly
desirable. An updated review on homogeneous and heterogeneous
alkylation chemistry and technology has been published recently
[240].
Although processes based on solid acids are still not operated
at industrial scale [240,242], several companies are developing
processes or offering technology for licensing. Rapid deactivation

of the solid catalyst has been the main concern of heterogeneous
alkylation processes during the last years, and the main challenge
is to achieve adequate catalyst stability. In any case, solid acid
catalysts have to be regenerated, and regeneration in the presence
of hydrogen seems to be the preferred solution. At present, the
solid acid alkylation technology developed seems to be able to
compete with the existing homogeneous processes, and their
commercial application in a near future will only depend on
environmental issues [240]. Some of the zeolite using technologies
available are the Exelus ExSact process, recently scaled up and
proven in a pilot plant [242–249], or the ABB Lummus Alkyclean
process schematized in Fig. 14 [250–252], whose catalyst is a noble
metal containing zeolite with low sensitivity towards feedstock
variation and common impurities [253,254]. The former is based
on a novel ﬁxed-bed reactor designed to enhance the performance
of a solid-acid catalyst [242], wherein the ﬁne-tuning of the micropores’ diameter improves catalyst life-time by 40% by enhancing
transport processes and reducing deactivation by coke formation
and pore mouth plugging. Moreover, the optimum strength and
distribution of the active sites enhances the product selectivity.
The AlkyClean process uses cyclic multi-staged reactors operation
(see Fig. 14), that alternates periods of on-line alkylation and
mild catalyst regenerations (rejuvenation), allowing the plant to
operate in a continuous mode maintaining the product quality.
Intermittently one of the reactors is taken off-line for higher
temperature H2 regeneration.
5.1.7. Dimerization and oligomerization processes
Oligomerization of light oleﬁns, such as propene and butenes, is
an important industrial route for producing synthetic liquid fuels
free of aromatics and sulfur. They are known to be ﬂexible processes, able to produce oleﬁnic mixtures, either in the range of
gasoline or diesel. Modifying the catalyst and the operation conditions it is possible to obtain these two fractions with the desired
characteristics regarding chain length and branching degree. Thus,
high temperatures (>300 ◦ C) and low pressures (≤30 bar) will favor
the formation of oligomers in the gasoline fraction, whereas lower
temperatures and higher pressures will increase the yield of heavier products in the diesel range. Concerning the catalyst, if based
on acid zeolites, the reaction mechanism involves carbenium ions
and, at least in the absence of steric constraints, the formation of

a highly branched product is favored. Thus, no shape selectivity is
required for production of gasoline, as trimethylpentenes are the
desired products. However, oligomerization of lower alkenes into
high quality diesel is a complex task. Two different strategies have
been proposed to face this problem: the ﬁrst approach is the modiﬁcation of the strength and environment of the acid centre, and the
second one is the application of the well-known concept of “shape
selectivity”. If zeolites with the adequate pore dimensions are used
it will be possible to control the chain growth and the branching
degree [227].
Medium pore zeolites are the most adequate for oleﬁn oligomerization to high quality middle distillates. Large pore zeolites, such
as HNaY [256] or Ni exchanged Y zeolite [257] have been described,
but fast deactivation and low selectivity to long, straight-chain
hydrocarbons desired for high quality diesel makes them not suitable for this process.
Although different 10MR structures are claimed for this process
in the patent literature, most of the articles are based on studies
using MFI. Shape selective oligomerization of C2–C5 oleﬁns to gasoline blending stocks is known since the 70s, but it was some years
later when researchers from Mobil and Chevron showed that, in
addition to gasoline, this zeolite converts propylene also to heavier compounds in the range of fuel oils [258,259]. One year later
Tabak et al. published a detailed description of the catalytic behavior of ZMS-5 in their MOGD process [260], and Table 3 shows
the product quality obtained for distillate and gasoline fractions.
Other oligomerization processes are offered by Sud-Chemie (COD
Sud-Chemie oligomerization process) [222,261] and ExxonMobil
(EMOGAS process) [262]. Both processes use a proprietary zeolite
based catalyst.
5.2. Petrochemistry
5.2.1. Production of para-xylene
Para-xylene (PX) is the most valuable xylene isomer, and is
used in the production of terephthalic acid (TPA) and dimethyl
terephthalate (DMT), two intermediates in the manufacture of
polyethylene terephthalate (PET) further used in polyester ﬁbers,
molded plastics, and ﬁlms. The C8 alkylaromatic mixtures obtained
from reformate and from the pyrolysis gasoline, are the main
sources of xylenes. In a ﬁrst step the p-xylene present is separated from the C8 aromatics mixture by selective adsorption on
molecular sieves or by crystallization, and the remaining mixture
is further upgraded to increase the yield of the desired para isomer
by catalytic isomerization. Ethylbenzene is also present in these
xylenes mixtures, its content may vary from 20 up to 50% according to the cut’s source, and is difﬁcult to separate from the xylenes

1571

mixture. Thus, xylenes isomerization units have to deal with these
high concentrations of EB that has to be converted. This is done by
hydro-isomerization of EB to xylenes, a process thermodynamically
limited, on a Pt-mordenite catalyst [263], or by hydro-dealkylation
to benzene and ethylene with the medium pore ZSM-5 [150,152].
Xylenes isomerization is a well known process, which is
performed with a ZSM-5 zeolite taking advantage of its shape selectivity properties and low coking tendency [204]. The combination of
conﬁgurational diffusion and restricted transition state selectivity
avoids the competing xylene disproportionation, reducing therefore xylene losses [264]. Fig. 15 illustrates the contribution of these
disproportionation reactions for zeolite structures of different pore
sizes, as well as the para-selectivity [265]).
Considering ZSM-5, para-selectivity can be further improved by
increasing the crystallite size or by selectivation of the external surface, which avoids unselective reactions to occur, but also by using
zeolites with larger crystallites [266] and/or by eliminating the acid
sites at the external surface through selective surface dealumination, chemical deposition of bulky organosilicon compounds, or
coke-selectivation treatments [267–271].
Other possible processes for production of xylenes are
transalkylation of toluene and C9+ aromatics, or toluene alkylation with methanol. In the ﬁrst case, the medium-pore zeolites are
usually replaced by large-pore zeolites, preferably mordenite [272].
Catalyst life may be increased by the addition of a metal function.
In the case of toluene alkylation with methanol the catalysts
used are ZSM-5, modiﬁed for increasing the selectivity to the
desired p-isomer [273], La-modiﬁed MCM-22 [274], SAPO-11 or
large pore mordenite or Y zeolite [275,276].
Finally, p-xylene can also be produced by disproportionation
of toluene [277]. This bimolecular acid catalyzed reaction is carried out with medium pore zeolites such as ZSM-5 or MCM-22
[278,279], and also in this case selectivation of the zeolite surface has a beneﬁcial effect [280], producing higher p-xylene yields
together with the high valuable benzene.
Several commercial technologies for p-xylene production are
detailed in [281]. The UOP Isomar and Parex processes are used
to produce the desired p-isomer from the C8-aromatics mixture,
and the PX-plus XP process produces p-xylene and benzene by
disproportionation of toluene. Exxon-Mobil Chemicals and Axens
also offer technologies for p-xylene production by toluene disproportionation. The former process uses an in situ coke selectivated
catalyst, increasing in this way the para-selectivity and the catalyst life. Axens has also an application for conversion of reformated
naphtha into aromatics, the ParamaX process.
5.2.2. Alkylation of aromatics
5.2.2.1. Ethylbenzene production. Ethylbenzene (EB) is mainly used
as intermediate for the production of styrene, an important
monomer from an industrial point of view. Most of the processes
synthesize EB from benzene and ethylene, and the worldwide
capacity amounts to 20 million tonnes/year. Traditional processes which produced ethylbenzene from benzene and ethylene
using Friedel-Crafts catalysts, e.g. AlCl3 –HCl, under mild conditions
(160 ◦ C) started operation in the 1930s. These processes, carried out
in liquid phase, present important corrosion problems, and reactors
were necessarily enameled or glass lined. To overcome these drawbacks supported catalysts were proposed in the 1960s, such as the
SPA gas phase operation or the AlkarTM process from UOP, based
on BF3 /Al2 O3 liquid phase operation. However, corrosion was not
totally avoided, the catalysts were not regenerable and were not
active for transalkylation. Thus, better alternatives, such as true
heterogeneous catalysts, were needed.
The Mobil/Badger process for gas phase ethylbenzene production in the presence of shape selective ZSM-5 zeolite was the ﬁrst
commercial zeolite based EB process. Its ﬁrst plant, with 1 MMM

lb/year capacity, came on-stream in 1980. Since then, Mobil has
been awarded 45 licenses [281] and the process accounts for 90%
of all new EB-processes installed according to [30]. Currently Mobil
Oil also licenses the Badger EB-Max technology based on a proprietary ExxonMobil alkylation and transalkylation catalyst [30,281],
which is claimed to be a MCM-22 type zeolite, very stable and very
selective to the monoalkylated product. This allows the process to
use low benzene to ethylene feed ratios (from 3 to 5) and to reduce
the benzene circulation rate [282].
Other ethylbenzene technologies are the liquid phase EB-One
process licensed by ABB Lummus Global and UOP LLC, based on a
proprietary modiﬁed Y zeolite catalyst from UOP, and the process
developed by CDTech and based on catalytic distillation principles,
also carried out in the presence of a zeolitic Y catalyst [30,281,282].
5.2.2.2. Cumene production. Cumene is an intermediate for phenol
and acetone production, and the worldwide capacity of this process
is around 8 million tonnes per year, distributed over around 40
plants.
The ﬁrst industrial process used free sulfuric acid as catalyst, which was replaced in the late 1940s by a new technology
based on solid phosphoric acid (SPA) developed by UOP. However,
SPA presents a negative environmental impact, besides corrosion
and handling problems. Thus, its substitution by environmentally
more friendly solid acids, such as zeolites, was desirable. Initially
the medium pore ZSM-5 zeolite, which was used in the MobilBadger ethylbenzene process, was studied as catalyst for gas phase
cumene synthesis, but it was only when efforts moved into large
pore zeolites and liquid phase operation, when results started to
appear attractive from an applied point of view. The zeolites based
processes produce higher cumene yields than conventional SPA
process as most of the diisopropylbenzene byproduct is converted
to cumene in separate transalkylation units. The absence of corrosion reduces operating and maintenance costs and zeolites can be
easily regenerated and safely disposed.
The zeolites employed for the cumene production processes
are generally large pore materials, which present no diffusional
restrictions for cumene through the 12MR pores. The exception is
MCM-22 (or MCM-56), a zeolite with medium pores and independent system of 12MR large cavities connected by 10MR windows,
that presents an unexpected good catalytic behavior, comparable to
that of a large pore zeolite. This has been explained by the complex
porous channel system of MWW structure, formed, as described
above, by two non-interconnected pore systems, both presenting

10 MR openings. One of them is formed by sinusoidal channels,
with a slightly elliptical section, and the other is constituted by
large supercages (18 A˚ long and 7.1 A˚ wide).
Perego et al. showed that the diffusion of cumene in the pores of
MCM-22 was hampered by a high energy barrier [283]. Moreover,
Sastre et al. [284] presented by means of molecular dynamic simulation that even benzene presented a low diffusivity in either of the
two pore systems of the MWW structure, and cumene could not diffuse through the 10 member ring channel system. In a comparative
study of zeolites Beta and MCM-22 it was shown that the alkylation of benzene on MCM-22 takes place mainly on the external
surface, which in this material is perfectly structured and formed
by ∼0.7 nm × 0.7 nm cups.
On the basis of this conclusion, the delaminated ITQ-2 zeolite [20,98], which combines external surface areas in the order
of 800 m2 g−1 with strong Brönsted acid sites of zeolitic type, was
studied as catalyst for ethylbenzene and cumene production, and
was proven to be highly active for alkylation of aromatics with
light oleﬁns, with increased activity and catalyst life as compared
to MCM-22 [285], as shown in Fig. 16.
Some of the commercial cumene processes based on large pore
zeolites which are currently available are the 3-DDM cumene process (Dow–Kellog) [286], the Mobil–Badger cumene process [287],
the CDTech (ABB Lummus [281], the Q-max (UOP) [281], or the Eni
Polimeri Europa cumene process [288,289].
5.3. Production of chemicals and ﬁne chemicals
The great variety of pore topologies and pore dimensions
together with the possibility to tailor their acid–base properties
as well as their easy and repeated regeneration, make zeolites very
attractive materials to be used as heterogeneous catalysts for synthesis of chemicals and ﬁne chemicals [290,291].
Many studies can be found in the open literature where zeolites are described as catalysts for acid catalyzed Friedel-Crafts
acylations, hydroxyalkylation of aromatic compounds, Diels-Alder
reactions, acetalization of carbonyl compounds, Fischer glycosidation reactions and isomerization reactions (isomerization of
␣-pinene and ␣-pinene oxide). Several reviews have been published by Chunshan Song related to the use of acid zeolites as shape
selective catalysts for the conversion of polycyclic hydrocarbons
to specialty chemicals (e.g. synthesis of 4,4 -dialkylbiphenyl compounds, with substituents ranging from isopropyl to methyl groups
on the bicyclic structure) [292–297].

An important acid catalyzed process, which is still performed
commercially with HCl, is the production of diamino diphenyl
methane (DADPM), a key intermediate for the production of
polyurethanes. The synthesis of DADPM, presented in Fig. 17,
involves the condensation of two aniline molecules with one
molecule of formaldehyde. Different solid acid catalysts have been
proposed for this process, such as ion exchange resins [298,299],
clays or amorphous silica–alumina [300]. Zeolites have also been

studied, and contribute with their characteristic shape selectivity,
favoring the formation of the 4,4 -DADPM isomer. Y, ZSM-5 Beta,
silylated Beta and ERB-1 zeolites have shown good catalytic properties [301–304]. They also present an additional advantage, their
resistance to water. However, even very small crystal size beta zeolites present diffusional and deactivation problems. This has been
very much improved by the use of delaminated zeolites, materials
with a much higher accessibility to the active sites, which maintain
the acidity, shape selectivity to 4,4 -DADPM and the water resistance of conventional zeolites. Their activity is higher than that of
the nanocrystalline beta, and their deactivation rate is considerably
slower [305].
The synthesis of ␧-caprolactam, an intermediate for the production of Nylon-6 is currently performed in the presence of highly
concentrated sulfuric acid, in a complex process with high environmental impact. An alternative route has been proposed where
zeolite based catalysts, e.g. ZSM-5 and TS-1, are used in the different
steps of the process, the hydration of cyclohexene to cyclohexanol and the oximation of cyclohexanone to cyclohexanone oxime
[306,307].
Sumitomo chemicals has developed a new production process
for caprolactam, by combining Sumitomo Chemical’s proprietary
catalysts with a new process from the Italian petrochemical company EniChem. The catalyst is a metal-containing pentasil-type
zeolite structure and the process, environmentally friendly, does
not generate ammonium sulfate [308,309].
An alternative route to ␧-caprolactam is the direct ammoximation of cyclohexanone proposed by Thomas and Raja [310,311].
The ﬁnal product is obtained by means of a one step solvent-free
conversion of cyclohexanone to ␧-caprolactam in the liquid phase
using oxygen (air) and NH3 . This reaction is catalyzed by structurally well deﬁned (MII MIII )AlPO-36 molecular sieve catalysts,
where M = Co, Mn. The framework MIII ions are the redox active centers, whereas the OH bonds attached to the framework and associated to the divalent MII ions are the Brönsted acid sites (see Fig. 18).
One of the most relevant applications of zeolites within the
chemical industry is as a red-ox catalyst in propylene epoxidation. Other oxidation reactions studied on zeolitic materials are
Baeyer–Villiger oxidations [312–316] or Meerwein–Ponndorf Verley reduction [317] and Oppenauer oxidation (MPVO) [318].
An interesting chemical process is the methanol carbonylation
for production of acetic acid, which is commercially performed by
means of an homogeneous iridium/iodide based catalyst [320]. In

the last years it has been shown that zeolites are able to catalyze
the carbonylation of methanol or dimethyl ether (DME) with CO,
in the practical absence of H2 O, with a high selectivity to methyl
acetate [321–327]. Different zeolite structures have been tested as
catalysts for the carbonylation of methanol, with mordenite being
the most active and selective, followed by ferrierite. Both zeolite
structures present 8-membered rings (8MR), and the reaction of
methoxy groups with CO has been suggested to selectively occur
within these 8MR pockets shown in Fig. 19 [323], whereas the acid
sites present at the 12MR channels would favor the formation of
hydrocarbons when working at higher temperatures. More details
on the contribution of the different sites to the overall carbonylation reaction are given in [319].
Large pore zeolites have been proposed for isomerization of
␣-pinene oxide to campholenic aldehyde, and important intermediate for the synthesis of certain fragrances. The highly dispersed
Lewis acid Al sites in a USY zeolite seem to be responsible for the
good performance of this catalyst [328]. High selectivity to the
desired products was obtained on Ti-beta, both in liquid and gas
phase [329].
Finally, zeolites in their basic form have also been described as
active for different C–C bond formation reactions, such as Knoevenagel condensation, Michael Additions and Aldol condensations,
and for side-chain alkylation of aromatics. Most of these processes are commercially manufactured using homogeneous bases.
One example of basic zeolite based process is the synthesis of 4methyl-thiazole (4-MT) using Cs2 SO4 /ZSM-5 claimed by Merck &
Co. researchers [31,330]. Although this process, as far as we know,

has not yet been commercialized, it reached the pilot plant stage in
2001 according to [29]. 4-MT is used in the production of thiobendazole, a systematic fungicide used for spoilage control of citrus
fruit and for preventing Dutch elm disease in trees and fungal disease in seed potatoes [331], and can be synthesized in one single
reaction step from acetone imine and SO2 over a basic zeolite. In
the presence of Cs-doped ZSM-5 (2 wt% Cs) this cyclization reaction
occurs at 470 ◦ C yielding 70% of 4-MT.
A revision of the current commercial applications of zeolites
in ﬁne chemicals can be found in [332]. Some of the processes
highlighted there are the synthesis of ␧-caprolactam, the synthesis
of trioxane, the isomerization of ␣-pinene oxide, the synthesis of
p-methoxyacetophenone, the production of 4-methylthiazole and
the production of methyl methacrylate.
Zeolites and, in general, structured molecular sieves, still offer
the scarcely explored possibility of multisite catalysts for selectively performing one-pot or cascade reactions, leading in this way
to process intensiﬁcation [333,334].
5.4. Emerging applications in energy and environment
5.4.1. Zeolites as catalyst for natural gas conversion
Natural gas appears as an attractive alternative source for fuels
and chemicals, due to its abundance in natural reservoirs, its high
H/C ratio and low undesired heteroatoms content. There are two
main routes for natural gas (methane) valorization, the single step
conversion of methane through direct routes, or the indirect routes,
where methane is converted to the more reactive synthesis gas

mixture, CO + H2 , in a previous process. The main direct routes are
methane dehydroaromatization (MDA) and the nonoxidative coupling of methane (NOCM), both of them very unfavorable from
the thermodynamic point of view. The low equilibrium conversions may be improved by selective extraction of H2 , one of the
main products [335]. Mo-containing zeolites, mainly ZSM-5 but
also MCM-22, have been thoroughly studied as catalysts for MDA
[207,212]. This topic has already been covered in Section 5.1 as one
of the processes for producing aromatics.
Processing of syngas offers many possibilities and a larger ﬂexibility towards the ﬁnal products. Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis (FTS) is
a well-known process for syngas conversion in to synthetic liquid
fuels. Moreover, the diesel fraction obtained in this way, formed
mainly by linear parafﬁns, has an outstanding quality, with cetane
numbers above 70, and very low contents of sulfur or polyaromatics. Conventional FTS catalysts are usually iron or cobalt promoted
porous inorganic oxides, such as SiO2 , Al2 O3 and TiO2 , and more
details can be found in [336]. Ordered mesoporous silicas and
delaminated zeolites (ITQ-2, ITQ-6) in their pure silica form have
also been described as supports for Co based FT catalysts. The
incorporation of the metal promoter is a key factor in the ﬁnal
catalytic behavior, and deposition of cobalt nanoparticles synthesized in the core of reverse micelles on previously silylated ITQ-2
has shown important beneﬁts [335]. However, non-delaminated
zeolites are less adequate than periodic mesoporous silicas as supports for conventional Co based FT catalysts for synthesis of long
chain hydrocarbons or waxes, due to the limited dimensions of their
pores. Moreover, acidity has to be avoided in this case.
Application of zeolites in syngas conversion has been contemplated for the so called modiﬁed FTS, which uses a hybrid or
composite catalyst, formed usually by a mechanical mixture of a
conventional iron or cobalt based FTS catalyst and a solid acid, such
as for instance a zeolite. The objective of the zeolite component
is to increase the yield and quality of liquid fuels, especially gasoline, by converting in situ the primary FTS hydrocarbons (␣-oleﬁns
and long-chain n-parafﬁns) through cracking and isomerization
reactions in a single stage process [335,337–339]. Beta, ZSM-5,
MCM-22 and delaminated ITQ-2 are some of the structures proposed. Fig. 20 shows the increased selectivity to isoparafﬁns when

combining FTS catalysts with ZSM-5. A detailed description of the
application of zeolites in FT processes is given by Martínez and
Prieto in [340].
5.4.2. Methanol to oleﬁns (MTO) and methanol to gasoline (MTG)
Methanol is produced from synthesis gas which, in turn, is
obtained by natural gas or coal reforming or even by gasiﬁcation
of lignocellulosic biomass. Although it could be used potentially as
a fuel, alone or blended with gasoline, this would involve technical problems difﬁcult to overcome. However, the conversion
of methanol into oleﬁns, highly valuable components within the
petrochemical industry, or into high-quality gasoline, are two interesting alternative processes [341]. The MTO process is ready for
commercialization, and UOP has already announced their SAPO34 based process for ethylene production. The MTG process has
been proven commercially, and the ﬁrst MTG plant was constructed in New Zealand in 1979 [342]. However, due to the relative
prices of methanol and gasoline, the plant currently only produces
methanol. The catalysts are based on ZSM-5 and SAPO-34, and more
details can be found in [342–346]. Fig. 21 shows a schematic representation of the dual cycle concept for the conversion of methanol
over H-ZSM-5 suggested in [344].
5.4.3. Sustainable energy applications
Catalytic production of high quality biodiesel is a topic of
increasing interest [347]. Some of the advantages of biodiesel
as compared to other fuels are: the non-contribution to the net
CO2 concentration when combusted, the absence of sulfur and its
biodegradability. As counterpart, for converting biomass into automotive fuels, a cheap and abundant biomass feedstock is needed,
and the high oxygen content of this alternative fuel source has to
be considered. Vegetable oils are triglyceride esters of fatty acids
that need to be converted to a mixture of fatty acid methyl esters
(FAME). Zeolites and mesoporous materials have been proposed
to carry out this process selectively. However, biomass conversion
involves the transformation of large and bulky molecules, which
will not be able to access the zeolite micropores. Thus, the role of
zeolites in the direct catalytic conversion of biomass is questionable [28], though they can be of interest for processing platform
chemicals obtained from biomass (ethanol, furfural, glycerol, levulinic acid) [348–350].

1576

Nevertheless, Perego and Bosetti [351] have recently presented
a route for hydroprocessing of tryglicerides with a bifunctional catalyst, the ECOFINING Technology jointly developed by ENI and UOP.
This process uses a catalytic hydroprocessing/isomerization technology for conversion of vegetable oils or animal greases into a
highly stable green diesel fuel, which is claimed to have better
properties than biodiesel [352].
A biomass pyrolysis process has been presented recently for
direct conversion of cellusosic biomass into liquid fuels in a single
step by catalytic pyrolysis [353,354]. The catalyst is based on ZSM-5
zeolite, and the ﬁnal product is a mixture of benzene, toluene and
xylenes. At present, the process has only been demonstrated at a
small scale.
5.4.4. Environmental applications
Environmental concern and development of catalytic processes
for environment protection started in the 1990s, and since then
a large number of technologies have been set forth. Centi and
Perathoner have given a very complete overview for the different applications of zeolites as environmental catalysts [355]. We
have seen in previous chapters that the substitution of less friendly
homogenous catalysts by zeolite based solid catalysts results in
environmentally compatible technologies and sustainable production processes. The same can be stated for the use of renewables
and conversion of biomass. Here we will focus on catalytic cleanup technologies for emissions coming from stationary sources
and for emissions from mobile sources (vehicle emissions). More
speciﬁcally, the conversion of nitrogen oxides together with the
elimination of VOCs from gas emissions are interesting ﬁelds for
zeolite based catalysts.
High temperature combustion of fossil fuels and biomass produces nitrogen oxides (NOx), which are responsible for acid rain
and for the presence of ozone in the troposphere. Thus, their
concentration in gaseous emissions from stationary sources, e.g.
thermal power plants, gas turbines and incinerators is limited.
Concerning the emissions from mobile sources, the main problem is related to diesel engines. Their CO emission is lower than that
of gasoline engines, the particle emission is solved by including a
particle ﬁlter, but NOx emissions should be avoided. The current
Euro V emission standards for passenger cars, applied since 2009,
limits the NOx emissions in diesel to 0.18 g/km, and to 0.06 g/km
in the case of gasoline. The level in the case of diesel will have to
be decreased to 0.08 g/km by 2014. Thus, catalytic technologies for
these exhaust gas treatments are facing an important challenge in
this ﬁeld.
An overall revision of the state of the art on catalytic removal
of NOx under lean conditions is given by Forzatti et al. in [356].
Currently the urea-ammonia selective catalytic reduction (SCR)
technology is well established and is largely employed for NOx
control in stationary sources emissions, but commercial catalysts
consist of homogeneous mixtures of tungsten and vanadium oxides
(or molybdenum oxide) supported on high surface area titania in
its anatase form, in the shape of honeycomb monoliths or plates to
overcome pressure drop problems. Up to now, commercial application of zeolites for NOx removal is still limited to adsorption
processes. However, SCR using zeolite based catalysts is a viable
option for reduction of NOx from diesel engines using urea as reductant [357], and Cu/MFI and Fe/MFI, together with 8MR zeolites seem
to be close to their commercial use for the control of diesel engine
exhaust emissions, according to [355].
When considering zeolitic catalysts for NOx SCR, the metals that
seem most adequate are copper, cobalt and iron. Concerning the
zeolite type, different structures have been described in the literature. Cu-ZSM-5 has been recognized for many years as a unique
catalyst for direct NO conversion [358]. Other zeolites claimed
were ZMS-11 or ZSM-12 [359,360]. However, recent in situ EPR

studies relate the higher activity of Cu-zeolites with an improved
accessibility of the active sites, rather than to the structure itself,
and shows a much higher activity on Cu-ZSM-11 and Cu-ZSM-12
than on Cu-ZSM-5. The advantage of ZSM-11 appears to be the
fact that it only contains straight 10MR pores, whereas ZSM-5 has
both straight and sinusoidal channels. Thus, in disagreement with
previous observations, the special pore structure of Cu-ZSM-5 is
not determinant for catalytic activity in NO decomposition [361].
Moreover, generation of mesoporosity in Cu-ZSM-5 and ZSM-11
signiﬁcantly improves the catalytic behavior, and again Cu-ZSM-11
performs better than Cu-ZSM-5 [362] (see Fig. 22).
More important than the zeolite structure itself, the key issue for
a good performing zeolite based SCR catalyst is the accessibility and
nature of the active metal ion sites, and this will be inﬂuenced by
the zeolite’s Si/Al ratio and the preparation conditions. Due to the
small size of the molecules involved in the process, shape selectivity
effects or electrostatic stabilization inside the zeolite structure will
not be signiﬁcant.
Other zeolites studied are beta, IM-5 or ITQ-7. An XPS and XAES
study of Cu-Beta with different Cu loadings, coupled with an in situ
type of catalytic experiments conducted in a high-pressure gas cell
installed in the preparation chamber of the spectrometer, showed
that the most active Cu-Beta zeolites for SCR of NOx were those in
which a rapid conversion between CuII and CuI species occurred
under reaction conditions, a conversion that was easier on overexchanged Cu-Beta samples. The authors found a good correlation
between the ratio of CuI to total Cu on the catalyst surface and
catalytic activity [363]. ITQ-7, with a topology similar to that of
zeolite beta, gave similar results when exchanged with Cu or Co
[364]. Finally, Cu-IM5 has been described as more active and more
stable hydrothermically than Cu-ZSM5 [365].
Very interesting results obtained with a physical mixture of tin
dioxide and the acid zeolite and a second metal such as manganese
or copper, as compared to tin-beta where the metal was introduced
in the framework by synthesis or by ion exchange, suggest that the
physical mixtures of metals with zeolites could be an interesting
and inexpensive way to prepare active catalysts for this reaction
[366]. Besides the high conversion for the NOx removal of this catalytic system, it is not deactivated by water at lean burn conditions
when the second metal is manganese, as shown in Fig. 23.
Researchers from Johnson Matthey Inc. presented a recent surface adsorption FTIR spectroscopy study on the differences in
transient response and the effect of NO:NO2 ratio on Fe or Cu
exchanged zeolites in the SCR of NOx with urea [367]. Still, the

main drawback concerning the industrial use of zeolite based SCR
catalyst is their long term hydrothermal stability [368–371]. Thus,
the trend is to use small 8MR pore zeolites, much more stable in the
highly demanding process conditions. Thus, cupper promoted SSZ13 and SAPO-34 (CHA structure) are some of the zeolites claimed
in the recent patent literature by BASF or PQ Corp for selective
reduction of NOx.
6. Future perspectives in commercial application of
inorganic molecular sieves as catalysts
The need to replace the currently remaining homogeneously
catalyzed commercial processes by heterogeneous alternatives,
and to improve existing technologies, offers to new molecular
sieves and modiﬁed existing ones the possibility to be commercially
applied. The use of high-throughput methodologies has already
proven to be highly efﬁcient, not only in the discovery of new
materials, but also for synthesis optimization to improve the characteristics of already existing zeolite structures, from the point of
view of the catalytic properties, as well as for reducing the synthesis
costs by employing less expensive SDAs or by completely avoiding
their use.
In the ﬁelds of reﬁning and petrochemistry the industrial zeolite
based processes are well established, but catalyst improvements
for higher selectivity or catalyst life time will have an important
economic impact. On the other hand, for the production of chemicals and ﬁne chemicals, the application of zeolites will have to
face important challenges, especially in the case of base catalyzed
processes. The discovery of new materials, the synthesis of known
zeolite structures by means of alternative, less expensive, synthesis
routes (OSDA free), and their modiﬁcation to generate nanocrystals,
mesopores or composites of different zeolites, will play a decisive
role for production of chemicals and ﬁne chemicals.
The conversion of alternative raw materials is a rather new
research line, and the use of zeolite based catalysts appears as a very
attractive option. Indeed, for biomass transformations, zeolites can
work in water media and their polarity (hydrophobicity–hydrophilicity) can be modulated. Furthermore, a very active research
ﬁeld in zeolites with high potential is related with the reduction
of nitrogen oxides by selective catalytic reduction, especially when
focused on small pore, highly hydrothermally stable zeolites.
7. Conclusions
More than 80% of all industrial processes are catalytic processes,
and many of them use zeolite based catalysts. The number of industrial processes based on heterogeneous catalysts is increasing, not
only in reﬁning and petrochemical areas, but also in new emerging

1577

ﬁelds. Some of the processes are well established, such as catalytic
cracking and hydrocracking, light parafﬁns isomerization or aromatic alkylation. They require relatively inexpensive zeolites and
probably only new zeolites with low cost production may have
an opportunity. This is not necessarily the case for production of
some chemicals and certainly not for ﬁne chemicals, in where the
impact of the catalyst cost on the ﬁnal product is relatively low.
The same could be said for the application of zeolites to automotive uses and for converting biomass derived products into higher
value chemicals. Finally, we believe there may be new opportunities for zeolites with more than one type of pore in the same
structure. Furthermore, one of the holy grails in the ﬁeld of zeolites
still is the synthesis of tridimensional extra-large pore hydrothermally stable zeolites. These materials may offer new possibilities
for processes in chemicals, ﬁne chemicals and biomass transformations. Meanwhile, for shape selectivity purposes, medium pore
zeolites (especially uni- and bidimensional) will probably continue
to play the most important role.
