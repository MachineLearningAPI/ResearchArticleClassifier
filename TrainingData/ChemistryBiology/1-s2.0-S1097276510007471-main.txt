Damage to our genetic material is an ongoing threat to both our ability to faithfully transmit genetic information to our offspring as well as our own survival. To respond to these threats, eukaryotes have evolved the
DNA damage response (DDR). The DDR is a complex signal transduction pathway that has the ability to sense
DNA damage and transduce this information to the cell to influence cellular responses to DNA damage. Cells
possess an arsenal of enzymatic tools capable of remodeling and repairing DNA; however, their activities
must be tightly regulated in a temporal, spatial, and DNA lesion-appropriate fashion to optimize repair and
prevent unnecessary and potentially deleterious alterations in the structure of DNA during normal cellular
processes. This review will focus on how the DDR controls DNA repair and the phenotypic consequences
of defects in these critical regulatory functions in mammals.
Since the discovery of the DNA structure more than 50 years
ago, the remarkable mechanisms that preserve the genetic information encoded by DNA and guarantee its faithful transmission
across generations have been the subject of extensive investigation. To maintain genomic integrity, DNA must be protected from
damage induced by environmental agents or generated spontaneously during DNA metabolism. Spontaneous DNA alterations
can be due to dNTP misincorporation during DNA replication,
interconversion between DNA bases caused by deamination,
loss of DNA bases following DNA depurination, and modification
of DNA bases by alkylation (Table 1) (Lindahl and Barnes, 2000).
Additionally, oxidized DNA bases and DNA breaks can be generated by reactive oxygen species (ROS) derived from normal
cellular metabolism. Altogether, it has been estimated that every
cell could experience up to 105 spontaneous DNA lesions per
day (Hoeijmakers, 2009).
Environmental DNA damage can be produced by physical or
chemical sources. Examples of physical genotoxic agents are
ionizing radiation (IR) and ultraviolet (UV) light from sunlight,
which can also induce up to 105 DNA lesions (pyrimidine dimers
and 6–4 photoproducts) per cell per day (Table 1) (Hoeijmakers,
2009). IR (from, e.g., cosmic radiation and medical treatments
employing X-rays or radiotherapy) can induce oxidation of DNA
bases and generate single-strand and double-strand DNA
breaks (SSBs and DSBs, respectively) (Table 1). Chemical
agents used in cancer chemotherapy can cause a variety of
DNA lesions: alkylating agents such as methyl methanesulfonate
(MMS) and temozolomide attach alkyl groups to DNA bases,
while crosslinking agents such as mitomycin C (MMC), cisplatin,
psoralen, and nitrogen mustard introduce covalent links
between bases of the same DNA strand (intrastrand crosslinks)
or of different DNA strands (interstrand crosslinks or ICLs). Other
chemical agents, such as the topoisomerase inhibitors camptothecin (CPT) and etoposide, which inhibit topoisomerase I or II,

respectively, induce the formation of SSBs or DSBs by trapping
topoisomerase-DNA covalent complexes. Cigarette smoking,
one of the most common mechanisms of self-inflicted DNA
damage, causes a wide variety of adducts and oxidative damage
in lung and other tissues. The measurement of lesions in smokers
in Table 1 is likely to be a vast underestimate of the total damage
produced per day, since smoke-induced DNA adducts present
in normal tissues adjacent to tumors are measured as a single
snapshot at the time of tumor removal, presumably hours or
days after the last cigarette exposure.
To counteract DNA damage, repair mechanisms specific for
many types of lesion have evolved. Mispaired DNA bases are replaced with correct bases by mismatch repair (MMR), and small
chemical alterations of DNA bases are repaired by base excision
repair (BER) through excision of the damaged base (Jiricny,
2006; Lindahl and Barnes, 2000). More complex lesions, such
as pyrimidine dimers and intrastrand crosslinks, are corrected
by nucleotide excision repair (NER) through the removal of an
oligonucleotide of approximately 30 bp containing the damaged
bases, while ICLs are excised by ICL repair with the assistance of
proteins involved in the genetic syndrome Fanconi anemia
(Hoeijmakers, 2009; Moldovan and D’Andrea, 2009). SSBs are
repaired by single-strand break repair (SSBR), whereas DSBs
are processed either by nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) or
homologous recombination (HR) (Caldecott, 2008; West,
2003). While NHEJ promotes the potentially inaccurate religation
of DSBs, HR precisely restores the genomic sequence of the
broken DNA ends by utilizing sister chromatids as template for
repair.
DNA repair is carried out by a plethora of enzymatic activities
that chemically modify DNA to repair DNA damage, including
nucleases, helicases, polymerases, topoisomerases, recombinases, ligases, glycosylases, demethylases, kinases, and phosphatases. These repair tools must be precisely regulated,

because each in its own right can wreak havoc on the integrity of
DNA if misused or allowed to access DNA at the inappropriate
time or place. Thus, eukaryotic cells have developed strategies
to recruit and activate the right factors in the right place at the
right time. Here, we describe the cellular mechanisms that regulate the recruitment of DNA repair factors to sites of DNA
damage, activate those factors, and coordinate the choice of
the pathways to employ for efficient DNA repair. Moreover, we
describe the pathological consequences that result from a defective response to DNA damage in humans.

Signal Transduction: Sending an SOS to Repair
The DNA damage response (DDR) is a signal transduction
pathway that senses DNA damage and replication stress and
sets in motion a choreographed response to protect the cell
and ameliorate the threat to the organism (Harper and Elledge,
2007; Jackson and Bartek, 2009). The DDR is primarily mediated
by proteins of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-like protein
kinase (PIKKs) family—ATM, ATR, and DNA-PK—and by members of the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) family. ATM
and DNA-PK are activated by DNA-damaging agents (e.g., IR)

that create DSBs (Figure 1A) (Harper and Elledge, 2007; Meek
et al., 2008). Unlike ATM, which has hundreds of substrates,
DNA-PK primarily regulates a smaller group of proteins involved
in DSB end joining. ATR, in complex with its partner protein
ATRIP, is activated following recruitment to RPA-coated ssDNA
regions generated at stalled replication forks (Figure 1B) and
DSBs (Cimprich and Cortez, 2008). The PARP family has 16
members, but only PARP1 and PARP2 have been implicated in
the DDR (Schreiber et al., 2006). PARP1 and PARP2 are activated by SSBs and DSBs and catalyze the addition of poly
(ADP-ribose) chains on proteins to recruit DDR factors to chromatin at breaks (Figure 1A) (Schreiber et al., 2006).
Much of the current understanding of the DDR is based on the
study of the ATM and ATR kinases. Following the recognition of
DNA lesions by sensor proteins, ATM and ATR initially phosphorylate mediator proteins, which can amplify the DDR by acting as
recruiters of ATM/ATR substrates (Zhou and Elledge, 2000).
Effector proteins of the DDR are either directly phosphorylated
by ATM/ATR or by the CHK1 and CHK2 kinases as well as other
kinases such as CK2, p38, and MK2 (Harper and Elledge, 2007).
The stability of ATM and ATR—and other PIKKs—is dependent
on the TEL2-TTI1-TTI2 (Triple T) complex, which has been reported to associate with the heat shock protein HSP90 and
possibly promote the maturation of newly synthesized PIKKs
(Hurov et al., 2010; Takai et al., 2007, 2010).
The DDR regulates physiological processes that involve
multiple layers of decisions. These include the determination to
undergo apoptosis or enter terminal differentiation through
senescence, the activation of heightened immune surveillance,
DNA damage prophylaxis through tanning, as well as DNA repair
itself (Cui et al., 2007; Gasser and Raulet, 2006; Zhou and
Elledge, 2000). ATM and ATR are required for NHEJ, HR, ICL
repair, and NER, as well as replication fork stability during
unperturbed DNA replication and in response to replication
blocks. While primarily mediated through relatively fast posttranslational modifications—such as phosphorylation and inhibition of the cell-cycle phosphatase CDC25 required for CDK
activation—a significant portion of the decision processes are
mediated through slower transcriptional responses that allow
integration of information over time. The most extensively
studied component of this response is p53, which is regulated
by ATM and CHK2 in response to DSBs (Figure 1A) (Zhou and
Elledge, 2000). p53 induces cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis, or
senescence in response to DNA damage by transcriptionally
regulating, among others, the CDK inhibitor p21 and the proapoptotic BAX and PUMA proteins (Riley et al., 2008). Moreover,
p53 directly activates repair pathways such as NER through
regulation of the NER factors XPC and DDB2 and induces
dNTP synthesis as described below (Ford, 2005). Importantly,
following DSB formation, p53 is activated by ATM in a cyclically
periodic manner through a transcriptional circuit involving the
WIP1 phosphatase and the MDM2 E3 ubiquitin ligase, both
p53 targets, which turn off ATM and p53, respectively (Batchelor
et al., 2009). This provides the cell with a time-measurement
mechanism that activates p53 transcriptional pulses in an oscillating fashion, depending on whether the initiating damage has
been repaired. This raises the interesting possibility that each
succeeding pulse occurs in a different proteome environment

and could impart distinct information to the cell on the persistence of damage, directing the cell to make different decisions,
such as apoptosis or senescence.
It is now clear that ATM and ATR coordinate a much wider
variety of cellular activities than initially anticipated, from DNA
replication and repair to transcription, metabolic signaling, and
RNA splicing (Bennetzen et al., 2010; Matsuoka et al., 2007;
Paulsen et al., 2009). Defective regulation of any of these activities results in genomic instability after DNA damage. In the next
sections, we will focus our attention on the mechanisms employed by the DDR to regulate DNA repair in order to preserve
genomic integrity.
Spatiotemporal Regulation of DNA Repair: Sensing the
Damage
Localization of DDR factors to sites of DNA damage is initiated by
sensor proteins that directly recognize specific DNA lesions and
activate the DDR (Zhou and Elledge, 2000). Interestingly, experiments performed both in yeast and mammalian cells have
demonstrated that forced tethering of sensor proteins to chromatin is sufficient to elicit the DDR cascade even in the absence
of DNA damage (Bonilla et al., 2008; Soutoglou and Misteli, 2008).
The next level of regulation of DNA repair resides in the DDRregulated recruitment of factors to sites of DNA damage, which
can be visualized as discrete nuclear foci by microscopy. DNA
damage-induced foci are highly dynamic structures subjected
to precise spatiotemporal regulation (Bekker-Jensen et al.,
2006). The precise order and timing of recruitment is thought to
provide a kinetic choice of repair options, presumably in an
optimized order. The assembly of the DDR cascade is dependent
on a broad spectrum of posttranslational modifications—phosphorylation, ubiquitination, sumoylation, poly(ADP-ribosylation),
acetylation, methylation—induced by the activation of the DDR
(Bergink and Jentsch, 2009; Harper and Elledge, 2007; Kleine
and Lu¨scher, 2009; Misteli and Soutoglou, 2009). These posttranslational modifications are specifically recognized by a wide
variety of protein domains, many of which mediate the recruitment to DNA damage sites. In the following sections, we will highlight the different mechanisms by which different lesions are
sensed, the different mechanisms by which the DDR factors
are recruited to sites of DNA damage, and the consequences of
DDR signaling on repair.
Single-Strand Break Repair
SSBs generated by IR and ROS or arising indirectly during BER
of abasic sites and altered DNA bases, such as 8oxoG and
3meA, activate PARP family members (Caldecott, 2008).
PARP1 and PARP2 act as molecular sensors of SSBs and
DSBs, which are recognized by two PARP1 zinc finger motifs.
Activation of PARP1 and PARP2 and subsequent synthesis of
poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) chains occurs within seconds at damage
sites and is one of the earliest events of the DDR. PAR chains are
rapidly disassembled by the PAR hydrolyzing enzyme PARG to
provide a quick transient response lasting minutes (Schreiber
et al., 2006). Upon DNA binding, PARP1/2 assembles PAR moieties from NAD+ on target proteins, including histones H1 and
H2B, and PARP1 itself (Schreiber et al., 2006). Histone PARylation is thought to contribute to chromatin reorganization and

recruitment of DNA repair and chromatin modifying complexes,
such as polycomb and histone deacetylase (HDAC) complexes,
at DNA damage sites (Polo et al., 2010; Schreiber et al., 2006;
Chou et al., 2010).
PAR Recruitment
PAR structures act as platforms upon which to recruit factors to
promote DNA repair. Three PAR-binding motifs have been
described: the macrodomain, PAR-binding zinc finger (PBZ),
and an 8 amino acid basic residue-rich cluster (Kleine and
Lu¨scher, 2009). Ten human proteins contain macrodomains,
including PARP9, PARP14, PARP15, the histone variant macroH2A1.1, and the chromatin remodeling factor ALC1 (Kleine
and Lu¨scher, 2009; Schreiber et al., 2006). Recent studies
have shown that macroH2A1.1 and ALC1 are recruited in
a PAR-dependent manner to sites of DNA damage, where they
contribute to the reorganization of chromatin structure (Ahel
et al., 2009; Gottschalk et al., 2009; Timinszky et al., 2009).
Several DDR factors contain the acid basic residue-rich
cluster, including p53, XRCC1, LIG3, MRE11, and ATM, whereas
PBZ motifs have recently been identified in the nucleases APLF
and SNM1 and in the cell-cycle checkpoint protein CHFR (Ahel
et al., 2008; Gagne´ et al., 2008). XRCC1 and LIG3 are recruited
to SSBs in a PARP1-dependent manner and promote SSB repair
following DNA end processing by XRCC1-interacting proteins,
such as DNA polymerase b, PNK, and the nucleases APE1,
APTX, and APLF (Caldecott, 2008). APLF is dependent on the
PBZ motif for its recruitment to DNA damage sites (Bekker-Jensen et al., 2007; Kanno et al., 2007; Rulten et al., 2008).
Double-Strand Break Repair
DSBs are life-threatening lesions whose repair is promoted by an
intricate network of multiple DNA repair pathways. At least four
independent pathways can repair DSBs: HR, NHEJ, alternative-NHEJ (alt-NHEJ), and single-strand annealing (SSA) (Figure 2). A main factor influencing the pathway choice is the extent
of DNA end processing. Classical NHEJ does not require DNA
end resection whereas alt-NHEJ (also known as microhomology-mediated end joining or MMEJ), HR, and SSA are dependent on DSB resection, which is limited for alt-NHEJ (5–25 nt)
and more extensive for HR and SSA (Hartlerode and Scully,
2009). In addition, at least four partially independent sensors
can detect DSBs: PARP, Ku70/Ku80, MRN, and with DSB processing, RPA.
DNA End Joining Promoted by Ku70/Ku80 and PARP
Double-strand DNA breaks are rapidly bound by the Ku heterodimer (Ku70 and Ku80), which has a toroidal structure with a hole
through which it loads onto DSB ends (Figure 2A) (Mahaney
et al., 2009). It also possesses a DNA end processing activity
(Roberts et al., 2010). Ku localizes within seconds to DSBs,

where it loads and activates the catalytic subunit of DNA-PK
(DNA-PKcs) to initiate NHEJ (Mahaney et al., 2009).
DNA-PKcs. During NHEJ, DNA-PKcs plays a critical role in
stabilizing DSB ends and preventing end resection through
a series of phosphorylation reactions (Figure 2A) (Meek et al.,
2008). Following DSB binding, DNA-PKcs autophosphorylation
on the six-residue ABCDE cluster (also known as the T2609
cluster) results in destabilization of the DNA-PKcs interaction
with the DNA ends, thus providing access to end processing
enzymes, such as ARTEMIS (Meek et al., 2008). Excessive end
processing is then prevented by DNA-PKcs autophosphorylation on the five-residue PQR cluster (also known as the S2056
cluster), which helps protect the DNA ends (Meek et al., 2008).
Interestingly, ABCDE phosphorylation, which can also be
induced by ATM, has been shown to facilitate the access of
DNA ends to DSB resecting enzymes in order to promote HR
when NHEJ fails (Shrivastav et al., 2008). Conversely, PQR phosphorylation has an inhibitory effect on HR by preventing end
resection (Meek et al., 2008). After DNA-PKcs is loaded,
XRCC4/LIG4 is recruited, which promotes the religation of the
broken ends with the help of the stimulatory factor XLF (Figure 2A) (Mahaney et al., 2009). DNA termini that contain nonligatable end groups are processed by the ARTEMIS and APLF
nucleases and the PNK kinase/phosphatase prior to DNA ligation (Mahaney et al., 2009). All three factors are phosphorylated
in an ATM-dependent manner, and ARTEMIS is a substrate for
DNA-PKcs (Macrae et al., 2008; Mahaney et al., 2009; Matsuoka
et al., 2007). ATM has been shown to play a role in 10% of NHEJ
through ARTEMIS (Jeggo and Lo¨brich, 2005). This may be an
underestimate because ATM and ATR often play redundant
roles. Supporting this, telomeres deprotected by loss of TRF2
and POT1 resemble a DSB and undergo end-to-end fusion via
NHEJ (Denchi and de Lange, 2007). This process requires either
ATM or ATR as the double mutant abrogates end fusions (Denchi
and de Lange, 2007).
PARP. As noted above, PARP1/2 also senses DSBs. PARP
acts to promote alt-NHEJ, which functions as backup to the
classical pathway of NHEJ described above (Figure 2C) (Wang
et al., 2006). PARP1 also competes with Ku binding to DNA
ends to promote HR (Figure 2B) (Hochegger et al., 2006). During
DSB repair, PARP1 is thought to mediate the initial accumulation
of the MRN complex to DSBs in a gH2AX- and MDC1-independent manner (Haince et al., 2008). Recruitment of ATM by MRN
and PARP1 could then contribute to the activation of the gH2AX
cascade and stabilization of DDR factors at sites of damage as
discussed below (Figure 1A) (Haince et al., 2007). Indeed,
PARP1 plays an initial role in the DDR by facilitating ATM activation, as indicated by the delayed phosphorylation of ATM
substrates observed in the absence of PARP1 following

Figure 1. Schematic Model for ATM and ATR Activation in Response to DNA Damage
(A) Formation of DSBs following IR treatment activates PARP1, which mediates the initial recruitment of the MRN/ATM complex at DSBs. Activation of the ATM
kinase activity by MRN and TIP60 leads to the phosphorylation of CHK2 and p53, in addition to a large number of other DDR factors, and the induction of the
gH2AX-dependent signaling cascade, which results in the recruitment of MDC1, RNF8, RNF168, BRCA1, and 53BP1 to DSBs, as described in greater detail
in the main text.
(B) DNA lesions induced by UV light or replication stress (denoted by red rectangular shapes) lead to replication fork stalling and accumulation of RPA-coated
ssDNA regions, which recruit the ATR/ATRIP and the RAD17/RFC2-5 complexes. Loading of the 9-1-1 complex by RAD17/RFC2-5 and stimulation of the ATR
kinase activity by the 9-1-1-associated protein TOPBP1 result in the activation of the ATR signaling cascade and CHK1 phosphorylation. Posttranslational modifications of the DDR factors depicted here are represented by different colored shapes, as indicated by the legend at the bottom of the figure.

treatment with DNA-damaging agents (Haince et al., 2007).
However, PARP1/2 and ATM also have independent functions,
as shown by the synthetic lethality of PARP1 (or PARP2) deletion
with ATM deficiency in mice (Huber et al., 2004).
Homologous Recombination Repair through MRN-ATM
and RPA-ATR
DSBs can also be recognized by the MRE11-RAD50-NBS1
(MRN) complex, which promotes the activation of ATM and the
preparation of DNA for HR (Figures 1 and 2) (Williams et al.,
2007). RAD50, a member of the SMC family, contains ATPase
domains that interact with MRE11 and associates with the
DNA ends of the DSB (Williams et al., 2007). In addition to stabilizing DNA ends, MRE11 has endonuclease and exonuclease
activities important for the initial steps of DNA end resection
that is essential for HR, as described below (Williams et al.,
2007). The third subunit of the MRN complex, NBS1, interacts
with MRE11 and contains additional protein-protein interaction
domains important for MRN function in the DDR. NBS1 associates with ATM via its C-terminal region, which promotes the
recruitment of ATM to DSBs, where ATM is activated by the
MRN complex by yet to be defined mechanisms, possibly
involving the formation of ssDNA oligos during end resection
(Figure 1A) (Jazayeri et al., 2008; Kanaar and Wyman, 2008;
Lee and Paull, 2005).
Resection Control. DNA end resection is regulated by ATM
through CtIP, which interacts with BRCA1 and MRN in the
BRCA1-C complex (Figure 2B) (Huen et al., 2010b). DSB resection is primarily induced in the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle,
when sister chromatids can be used for HR (You and Bailis,
2010). Limited DSB resection is carried out by CtIP in G1 in
a BRCA1-independent manner to promote alt-NHEJ, which is
mediated by the annealing of ssDNA microhomology regions,
followed by LIG3-dependent DNA end ligation (Figure 2C) (You
and Bailis, 2010; Yun and Hiom, 2009). In S and G2, CtIP associates with BRCA1, which ubiquitinates CtIP and facilitates its
association with damage sites (Huen et al., 2010b). CtIP recruitment is also dependent on MRN and ATM kinase activity, helping
explain ATM’s role in DSB resection (You and Bailis, 2010). Two
and seven ATM phosphorylation sites have been identified in
CtIP and BRCA1, respectively, but their precise function remains
to be elucidated (Ouchi, 2006; You and Bailis, 2010). In addition,
EXO1, which is involved in the processive stage of DSB resection
together with BLM following the initial resection carried out by
CtIP, is also stimulated by ATM phosphorylation (Figure 2B) (Bol-

derson et al., 2010). Moreover, ARTEMIS, which is also regulated
by ATM, has been suggested to play a role in DSB resection
(Beucher et al., 2009).
Pathway Choice. The orderly progression of choices between
alternative DNA repair pathways could be facilitated by negative
regulation of one pathway by another. Indeed, DSB resection
promoted by CtIP and ATM can be inhibited by 53BP1
(Figure 2B) (Bunting et al., 2010). 53BP1 has been suggested
to promote NHEJ by increasing the stability and mobility of
DSBs to find each other for productive ligation (Difilippantonio
et al., 2008; Dimitrova et al., 2008). Loss of 53BP1 partially
rescues the HR defect of BRCA1 mutant cells, suggesting that
BRCA1 might somehow overcome 53BP1 function at DSBs in
order to promote DSB resection (Bouwman et al., 2010; Bunting
et al., 2010). Defective DSB resection in BRCA1 mutant cells
results in NHEJ-dependent chromosomal rearrangements,
whose formation could be prevented by 53BP1 loss (Bunting
et al., 2010). Interestingly, DSB resection induced by 53BP1
deletion was shown to increase alt-NHEJ and decrease classical
NHEJ during immunoglobulin maturation in G1 phase B cells
(Bothmer et al., 2010). It is known that abnormal activity of altNHEJ in the absence of functional NHEJ induces chromosomal
translocations in mammalian cells (Simsek and Jasin, 2010).
Altogether, these observations indicate that alterations of the
correct balance between DSB repair pathways can lead to
genomic instability. Another case in point, the chromosomal
instability defects and DNA damage sensitivity of Fanconi
anemia (FA) mutant cells have recently been shown to be due
to aberrant NHEJ, indicating that FA proteins might promote
HR and suppress NHEJ (Adamo et al., 2010; Pace et al., 2010).
Thus, in the absence of the proper repair pathway choice, incorrect pathway choices can be deleterious.

ends leads to RPA accumulation (Figure 2B). RPA is an essential
heterotrimeric complex (RPA1, RPA2, RPA3) that stabilizes
ssDNA regions generated during DNA replication and repair
(Wold, 1997). RPA-ssDNA complexes play a critical role in activation of the ATR pathway, as described in greater detail below.
In the presence of repetitive DNA sequences that are repaired by
SSA, annealing of the resected 30 ssDNA could be catalyzed by
RAD52, followed by removal of DNA flaps by XPF/ERCC1
(Figure 2D) (Hartlerode and Scully, 2009; Motycka et al., 2004).
Alternatively, assembly of RAD51 filaments on RPA-coated
ssDNA mediated by BRCA2 can lead to HR (Figure 2B) (West,

Figure 2. Alternative DNA Repair Pathways Involved in the Repair of Double-Strand Breaks
(A) Rapid association of Ku to DSBs promotes NHEJ by recruiting DNA-PKcs. Sequential phosphorylation events on multiple DNA-PKcs amino acid clusters
favors the initial processing of DNA ends by ARTEMIS, followed by DNA-PKcs-dependent protection of DNA ends required for DNA ligation.
(B) Alternatively to NHEJ, MRN, which is initially recruited to DSBs by PARP in competition with Ku, mediates the initial stages of DSB resection together with CtIP
and BRCA1 to promote homologous recombination in S and G2. 53BP1 has an inhibitory role on DSB resection and is negatively regulated by BRCA1 by unknown
mechanisms. The MRN/CtIP/BRCA1 complex can also promote DSB resection following deprotection of DNA ends when NHEJ fails. Extensive DSB resection
and formation of RPA-coated 30 ssDNA ends is induced by EXO1 and BLM. ATM plays a central role in the regulation of DSB resection, as described in the main
text. Displacement of RPA from the 30 ssDNA ends and assembly of RAD51 filaments mediated by BRCA2 leads to strand invasion into homologous DNA
sequences. Recruitment of RAD51 to ssDNA ends is regulated by the ATR pathway, which is activated following DSB resection. D loop structures formed after
strand invasion can be cleaved by MUS81/EME1 or displaced by RTEL1 during SDSA to generate crossover or noncrossover events, respectively. Noncrossovers are generated also by dissolution of Holliday junctions (HJs) by the BLM/TOPOIII complex, whereas HJ resolution by the nucleases GEN1 and SLX1/SLX4,
which associates with MUS81/EME1, can generate both crossover and noncrossover events.
(C) Limited DSB resection carried out by CtIP and MRN in G1 results in alternative NHEJ.

Review
2003). The interaction between RAD51 and BRCA2 C terminus,
which is important for HR, is thought to be limited to S and G2
phases of the cell cycle by CDK-dependent phosphorylation of
BRCA2 (Esashi et al., 2005). Further regulation of HR is provided
by RAD51 phosphorylation mediated by CHK1, which is required
for RAD51 recruitment to damage sites (Sørensen et al., 2005).
BRCA2 is also phosphorylated by ATM/ATR (Matsuoka et al.,
2007). Moreover, RPA2 undergoes ATM/ATR-mediated hyperphosphorylation followed by PP4-dependent dephosphorylation, which was shown to be important for HR (Lee et al.,
2010a). Furthermore, sumoylation of RPA1 was recently suggested to promote HR by facilitating the recruitment of RAD51
(Dou et al., 2010).
Crossover Regulation. Following RAD51-dependent strand
invasion into homologous sequences of the sister chromatid
and formation of D loop structures, the 30 invading strand could
be extended by DNA polymerases and then reanneal to the processed second end of the break (West, 2003). This pathway,
which is known as synthesis-dependent strand annealing
(SDSA), is thought to be promoted by the RTEL helicase after
displacement of the RAD51 filament and D loop dissociation
(Figure 2B) (Barber et al., 2008). Alternative to this pathway,
double Holliday junctions (dHJs) could be formed after ligation
of the invading strand with the second end captured by D loop
branch migration (West, 2003). HJ intermediates could be dissolved by the BLM/TOPOIII complex or cleaved by the endonucleases GEN1, MUS81/EME1, or SLX1/SLX4 to generate either
crossover or noncrossover of the markers flanking the dHJ
(Figure 2B) (Andersen et al., 2009; Ciccia et al., 2008; Fekairi
et al., 2009; Ip et al., 2008; Mun˜oz et al., 2009; Svendsen et al.,
2009). Crossover events, which could be generated by GEN1,
MUS81/EME1, or SLX1/SLX4, are highly regulated, as they can
lead to loss of heterozygosity and genomic rearrangements in
mitotic cells. Indeed, the high increase in the number of crossover events, which can be visualized as sister chromatid
exchanges or SCEs, displayed by BLM defective cells causes
genomic instability (Chu and Hickson, 2009). It is known that
BLM and SLX4 are ATM/ATR substrates and yeast MUS81 is inhibited by phosphorylation by the yeast CHK2 ortholog (Bachrati
and Hickson, 2008; Kai et al., 2005; Svendsen et al., 2009). How
phosphorylation of BLM, SLX4, and MUS81 might affect their
activity on HJ intermediates has not been determined. Nonetheless, the importance of both ATM and ATR in HR is indicated by
the strong recombination defects displayed by cells with ATM or
ATR deficiency (Beucher et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2004).
gH2AX: Phosphorylation-Dependent Recruitment and
Modification Cascades
ATM and ATR promote DSB repair in part through phosphorylation-dependent recruitment of DDR factors to sites of DNA
damage. A critical aspect of this process involves the phosphorylation of Ser139 on the specialized histone H2AX called gH2AX
(Figure 1A) (Rogakou et al., 1998). H2AX phosphorylation
spreads for distances up to 1–2 megabases around DSBs in an
ATM- and MDC1-dependent manner and initiates a cascade of
factor assembly (Harper and Elledge, 2007). MDC1 directly binds
the phospho-Ser139 of H2AX through its C-terminal BRCT
repeats (Figure 1A) (Stucki, 2009). H2AX Tyr142 is constitutively
phosphorylated by the kinase WSTF, a member of the BAZ/
186 Molecular Cell 40, October 22, 2010 ª2010 Elsevier Inc.

WAL family of chromatin remodeling enzymes, and blocks
MDC1 recruitment (Xiao et al., 2009). Following DNA damage,
Tyr142 is dephosphorylated by the tyrosine phosphatases
EYA1 and EYA3 (Cook et al., 2009; Krishnan et al., 2009). Interestingly, MDC1 binding to gH2AX was shown to depend on Tyr142
dephosphorylation by EYA1/3, whereas the proapoptotic kinase
JNK1 was reported to associate with H2AX phosphorylated on
both Ser139 and Tyr142 (Cook et al., 2009). This observation
has led to the proposal that Tyr142 phosphorylation of gH2AX
might provide a molecular switch between JNK-mediated
apoptosis and MDC1-dependent DSB repair (Stucki, 2009). In
particular, MDC1 has been reported to facilitate both NHEJ and
HR in H2AX-dependent manner (Hartlerode and Scully, 2009).
The MDC1 Platform. MDC1 associates with the FHA and
BRCT motifs of NBS1 through multiple SDTD sites that are
constitutively phosphorylated by CK2 (Chapman and Jackson,
2008; Melander et al., 2008; Spycher et al., 2008; Wu et al.,
2008). Moreover, MDC1 binds ATM through its FHA domain to
further propagate gH2AX spreading (Figure 1A) (Lou et al.,
2006). Formation of extensive gH2AX regions is important for
sustaining the DDR, as H2AX is not required for the initial localization of NBS1, BRCA1, and 53BP1 at DSBs via PARP but rather
for the maintenance of these DDR factors at sites of damage
(Celeste et al., 2002). Stabilization of DDR factor recruitment to
gH2AX nucleosomes is achieved through the recruitment of an
intricate network of chromatin modifying enzymes regulating
ubiquitination, sumoylation, acetylation, and methylation, as
described below. In addition, experiments in yeast and mammalian cells have shown that chromatin remodeling enzymes, such
as the SNF2 family protein INO80 and SWI/SNF, are recruited to
DSBs in a gH2AX-dependent manner (Lee et al., 2010b; van Attikum and Gasser, 2009). INO80 is thought to promote nucleosome eviction to facilitate DSB resection and HR. Similarly,
SWI/SNF is known to stimulate chromatin relaxation at DSBs.
Accumulation of SWI/SNF at DNA damage sites is facilitated
by its interaction with the BRCT domain-containing protein
MCPH1/BRIT1, which directly associates with gH2AX in an
MDC1-independent manner (Lin et al., 2010).
Ubiquitin-Mediated Recruitment. DDR-dependent MDC1
phosphorylation and recruitment to gH2AX initiates a ubiquitination cascade at sites of DNA damage that primarily involve
protein monoubiquitination or Lys63 (K63)-linked polyubiquitination (Messick and Greenberg, 2009). The ubiquitin ligase RNF8
associates to MDC1 phospho-TQ sites through an N-terminal
FHA domain and activates a DDR-induced ubiquitination
cascade by K63-linked ubiquitination of H2A and gH2AX
(Figure 1A) (Huen et al., 2007; Kolas et al., 2007; Mailand et al.,
2007). The E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF168 then binds these chains
through its motifs interacting with ubiquitin (MIU) to stimulate
K63 ubiquitination (Doil et al., 2009; Stewart et al., 2009). A third
E3 ubiquitin ligase, HERC2, interacts with the FHA domain of
RNF8 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner and facilitates
the assembly of the RNF8/UBC13 complex, further stimulating
K63-linked ubiquitin ligase activity (Bekker-Jensen et al.,
2010). The K63-ubiquitin chains generated by RNF8 and
RNF168 are recognized by the ubiquitin-interacting motif (UIM)
of RAP80, which recruits the BRCA1-A complex, itself an E3
ligase, through the interaction with the scaffold protein ABRA1

Molecular Cell

Review
(Figure 1A) (Huen et al., 2007; Kolas et al., 2007; Wang and Elledge, 2007). The BRCA1-A complex additionally includes the
ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme variant (UEV) motif containing
protein BRE, the ubiquitin protease BRCC36, and the adaptor
protein NBA1 and has structural similarities to the proteasome
lid (Feng et al., 2009; Shao et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2009). Ubiquitin binding activity has been shown for several subunits of the
BRCA1-A complex, including ABRA1, BRE, BRCC36, NBA1,
and RAP80 (Wang et al., 2009). Interestingly, recent observations have shown that the deubiquitinating enzyme OTUB1
suppresses RNF168-dependent ubiquitination by direct inhibition of UBC13 (Nakada et al., 2010).
SUMO-Mediated Recruitment. It has recently been reported
that the accumulation of the BRCA1-A complex at DSBs is
also dependent on sumoylation (Galanty et al., 2009; Morris
et al., 2009). Indeed, the SUMO ligases PIAS1 and PIAS4 have
been shown to localize at sites of DNA damage, and PIAS4
was reported to stimulate the ubiquitin ligase activity of the
RNF8/UBC13 complex, thus promoting the recruitment of
RNF168 and BRCA1 to sites of DNA damage (Figure 1A).
PIAS1 has instead been proposed to directly sumoylate
BRCA1 and stimulate its ubiquitin ligase activity (Galanty et al.,
2009; Morris et al., 2009). Therefore, PIAS1 and PIAS4 might
function as regulators of the ubiquitin ligase activity of RNF8
and BRCA1, respectively. In addition, 53BP1 recruitment to
DSBs depends on the SUMO ligase PIAS4, which is also thought
to directly sumoylate 53BP1 (Figure 1A) (Galanty et al., 2009).
Given that 53BP1 does not display ubiquitin binding activity, it
has been proposed that RNF8/RNF168 ubiquitination might
induce chromatin relaxation and subsequent exposure of
dimethyl H4K20—and possibly dimethyl H3K79—which are
recognized by 53BP1 tudor domains (FitzGerald et al., 2009).
H3K79 and H4K20 dimethylation levels do not appear to change
after DNA damage, indicating that de novo histone methylation is
not promoting 53BP1 recruitment (FitzGerald et al., 2009).
53BP1 is known to associate with the deubiquitinating enzyme
USP28 and PTIP, a six-BRCT motif-containing protein, in a phospho-dependent manner (Mohammad and Yaffe, 2009; Zhang
et al., 2006). Despite the interaction with 53BP1, PTIP appears
to be recruited to damage sites in a 53BP1-independent but
RNF8/UBC13-dependent manner (Mohammad and Yaffe,
2009).
All of the complexities in modifications that are responsible for
recruiting these many factors to sites of DNA damage or replication stress pose a significant conundrum for the field. Why do we
need so many different modifications to build these structures?
Is this an evolutionary accident or is there method in this
madness? One possibility is that each layer of modification,
i.e., phosphorylation, ubiquitination, sumoylation, and acetylation, recruits a different constellation of factors with distinct
repair capabilities. Since the focus of proteins is built in
layers, there could be a kinetic ordering of repair choices
evident in each layer. Furthermore, since multiple E3 ligases
(RNF8, RNF168, HERC2, BRCA1/BARD1) and deubiquitinating
enzymes (USP28, BRCC36) are simultaneously recruited, phosphorylated, and modified themselves, significant regulation
of modifications could occur within these structures, thereby
directing repair choices as events unfold. For example, if

a DSB is clean, it can be directly religated. If it is not, nucleolytic
restructuring must occur. If the break is not held together, factors
that promote end searching may be required to bring the ends
into proximity for repair, as proposed for 53BP1. If this attempt
fails, unwinding or resection of the ends might occur to allow
a search for microhomologies for alt-NHEJ or more extensive
homologies as for classical RAD51-mediated HR. These choices
require different, often competing repair activities that must be
temporally and structurally coordinated in a manner that optimally deals with the eventualities that occur with different repair
events. Multiple modification layers may allow exquisite control
of these choices. Clearly, it will be critical to dissect the contribution of each individual focus component to different repair pathways in order to understand how these dynamic structures
influence repair choices.
DNA Replication Stress, Fork Stalling, and ICLs
Perhaps the most dangerous lesion facing cells is the stalling of
a replication fork. Failure to properly overcome such lesions
leads to an inability to complete chromosome duplication and
can lead to mitotic catastrophe, complex chromosomal rearrangements, and cell death. Cells have evolved multiple mechanisms to sense and respond precisely to these catastrophic
types of lesions.
RPA: Sensor of DNA Replication Stress
Bulky DNA lesions can lead to arrest of leading strand synthesis
at the replication fork and formation of extensive RPA-coated
ssDNA regions due to the uncoupling between the MCM helicase and the DNA polymerase (Figure 1B) (Byun et al., 2005).
RPA1 polymerizes on this ssDNA to generate a platform that
activates the central signaling pathway orchestrating DNA replication responses, the ATR pathway. RPA-ssDNA complex
recruits the ATR/ATRIP complex through direct interaction with
ATRIP to localize it to the fork (Figure 1B) (Zou and Elledge,
2003). Furthermore, it stimulates binding and activation of the
RAD17-RFC2-5 clamp loader, which loads the PCNA-related
RAD9-HUS1-RAD1 (9-1-1) heterotrimer bound to the ATRactivating TOPBP1 protein and stimulates ATR kinase activity
(Cimprich and Cortez, 2008; Ellison and Stillman, 2003; Kumagai
et al., 2006; Mordes et al., 2008; Zou et al., 2003). The 9-1-1
complex is loaded onto 50 or 30 DNA ends adjacent to RPAcoated ssDNA regions (Cimprich and Cortez, 2008). It is the
colocalization of these two RPA-dependent complexes that
sets in motion the ATR signaling cascade, which results in the
activation of CHK1 and CHK2 kinase signaling and phosphorylation of many chromatin bound factors to promote fork stability
and restart of stalled or collapsed replication forks in order to
complete chromosome replication (Cimprich and Cortez, 2008).
Restart of Stalled or Collapsed Replication Forks
Replication forks are fragile DNA structures that must be stabilized when fork progression is arrested by DNA lesions. Fork
stability is promoted by the TIM/TIPIN complex and CLASPIN,
both ATR targets (Errico and Costanzo, 2010). TIPIN and its
partner protein, TIMELESS, associate with RPA2 to stabilize
stalled forks and promote the accumulation of CHK1 and its
regulatory protein CLASPIN to RPA-ssDNA regions where
CHK1 can be activated by ATR (Figure 1B) (Kemp et al., 2010).
Restart of stalled replication forks is dependent on several

DNA helicases or translocases, including BLM, WRN, FANCM,
HLTF, and SMARCAL1, many of which are recruited to forks
by RPA or interact with RPA at forks (Bachrati and Hickson,
2008; Driscoll and Cimprich, 2009; Luke-Glaser et al., 2010;
Unk et al., 2010). In particular, SMARCAL1 interacts with RPA2
through an RPA2 interaction motif common to TIPIN, RAD52,
XPA, and UNG2 (Bansbach et al., 2009; Ciccia et al., 2009;
Postow et al., 2009; Yuan et al., 2009; Yusufzai et al., 2009).
SMARCAL1, BLM, WRN, and FANCM undergo ATM/ATRdependent phosphorylation after DNA damage (Bachrati and
Hickson, 2008; Bansbach et al., 2009; Postow et al., 2009;
Whitby, 2010; Yuan et al., 2009). BLM phosphorylation by ATR
was shown to be important for recovery after replication stress,
and FANCM phosphorylation results in its tighter association
with chromatin (Bachrati and Hickson, 2008; Kim et al., 2008).
BLM, WRN, FANCM, and HLTF have been suggested to regress
replication by favoring the annealing of the leading- and laggingstrands and generating a HJ-like structure also known as
‘‘chicken foot,’’ which could allow the restart of DNA synthesis
by template switching and lesion bypass (Atkinson and
McGlynn, 2009; Blastya´k et al., 2010). SMARCAL1 might also
promote replication fork regression, given the similarity between
the helicase domain of SMARCAL1 and yeast Rad5, which
was shown to regress replication forks (Atkinson and McGlynn,
2009; Blastya´k et al., 2007). Future studies will be needed
to uncover the coordination between these enzymes at the
replication fork.
SSBs encountered by the replication fork can be converted
into DSBs during DNA synthesis, thus inducing fork collapse.
Replication fork collapse could also be induced by direct fork
cleavage by the MUS81/EME1 endonuclease following replication arrest (Ciccia et al., 2008; Hanada et al., 2007). Different
from DSBs formed in nonreplicating regions, collapsed replication forks contain one-ended DSBs. Repair of one-ended
DSBs is carried out by the break-induced replication (BIR)
pathway, which involves DSB resection, strand invasion, and
reassembly of a new replication fork at RAD51-generated D
loop intermediates (Llorente et al., 2008). PARP1/2 could facilitate processing of DSBs generated after replication stress
by recruiting MRN (Bryant et al., 2009). Incorrect regulation
of BIR could lead to multiple rounds of strand invasion and
DNA synthesis at nonperfectly homologous DNA sequences,
thus leading to chromosomal rearrangements (Llorente et al.,
2008). BIR has been observed in yeast; however, its role in
replication fork recovery in higher eukaryotes has not yet been
visualized.

PCNA and Postreplication Repair of ssDNA Gaps
Replication restart of stalled replication forks could be accomplished by reinitiation of leading- and lagging-strand synthesis
downstream of the DNA lesion, as demonstrated in bacteria
and yeast (Figure 3A) (Branzei and Foiani, 2010). Replication
restart would leave behind the replication fork ssDNA gaps,
which in yeast have been shown to be subsequently repaired
by either translesion synthesis (TLS) or error-free postreplication
repair (PRR) in a manner dependent on the RAD6/RAD18 ubiquitin ligase complex (Branzei and Foiani, 2010; Daigaku et al.,
2010; Karras and Jentsch, 2010). Whereas TLS involves the
direct bypass of the DNA lesion using the 30 end of the DNA filament arrested, error-free PRR is thought to promote strand invasion and repair of the ssDNA gaps by template switch and HR
(Budzowska and Kanaar, 2009). TLS and error-free PRR are
thought to be dependent, respectively, on monoubiquitination
or K63-linked polyubiquitination of PCNA (Figure 3A) (Ulrich
and Walden, 2010). PCNA monoubiquitination is promoted by
the RAD6/RAD18 complex, which is recruited by RPA to unreplicated ssDNA regions (Davies et al., 2008). Monoubiquitinated
PCNA can be further subjected to K63-linked polyubiquitination
by the ubiquitin ligases UBC13, HLTF, and SHPRH (Unk et al.,
2010). HLTF and SHPRH are the mammalian orthologs of yeast
Rad5 (Unk et al., 2010).
The PCNA Platform. PCNA is a homotrimeric DNA sliding
clamp that functions as processivity factor for DNA polymerases
(Moldovan et al., 2007). PCNA, which is loaded by the clamp
loader RFC at 30 primer-template junctions, tethers DNA polymerases to DNA and serves as loading platform for proteins
that operate in conjunction with DNA synthesis. PCNA accumulates rapidly at sites of DNA damage, where it recruits DDR
factors containing PCNA interaction motifs (Moldovan et al.,
2007). How PCNA accumulates on DNA and whether that is
regulated by the DDR is not yet clear, although RFC is phosphorylated in response to DNA damage (Matsuoka et al., 2007). Three
PCNA interaction motifs are known: the PCNA-interacting
protein (PIP)-box, the AlkB homolog 2 PCNA-interacting motif
(APIM), and the KA-box (Gilljam et al., 2009; Moldovan et al.,
2007; Xu et al., 2001). More than 400 human proteins with putative PIP-box or APIM motif have been identified based on bioinformatic analyses (http://tare.medisin.ntnu.no/pcna/index.php).
Approximately 30 PIP-box-containing proteins have currently
been shown to directly interact with PCNA, including TLS polymerases and NER, BER, and MMR factors (Moldovan et al.,
2007). Following DNA damage, the accumulation of PIP-boxcontaining proteins, such as TLS polymerases, was shown to

Figure 3. Repair of DNA Lesions Encountered during DNA Replication
(A) Postreplication repair of ssDNA gaps. Leading strand synthesis arrested at DNA lesions (red rectangular shapes) can be reprimed downstream of lesions,
leaving ssDNA gaps behind the replication fork. Repair of ssDNA gaps is mediated by RAD6 and RAD18, which are recruited by RPA to ssDNA gaps, where
they monoubiquitinate PCNA. Monoubiquitinated PCNA associates with translesion polymerases, which promote lesion bypass. Alternatively, polyubiquitination
of PCNA by SHPRH, HLTF, and UBC13 induces template switching and strand invasion into homologous sequences of the sister chromatid. Template switching
could possibly involve proteins interacting with polyubiquitinated PCNA. Resolution of Holliday junctions (HJs) formed after strand invasion can then result in
sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs), whereas HJ dissolution and SDSA do not generate SCEs.
(B) Repair of interstrand crosslinks. Converging replication forks blocked by interstrand crosslinks (red rectangle) activate the FA pathway. The FA core complex
associated to blocked replication forks through the FANCM complex promotes the monoubiquitination of the FANCD2/FANCI (ID) complex. Phosphorylation of
FANCI by ATR regulates the ubiquitination of the ID complex and its subsequent relocalization to blocked replication forks. Monoubiquitinated ID complex
promotes fork cleavage, probably through the interaction with FAN1 and possibly other nucleases, translesion synthesis, and crosslink excision. DSB resection,
which could be dependent on FAN1, in addition to CtIP/MRN, BLM, and EXO1, leads to strand invasion and homologous recombination with or without formation
of SCEs as described in (A). Posttranslational modifications are indicated as in Figure 1.

be dependent on a functional PIP-box (Moldovan et al., 2007).
Given the intense competition among PIP-box-containing
proteins for the same binding pocket of PCNA (the interdomain-connecting loop that connects the PCNA monomers), the
PCNA binding affinity of specific DDR factors after DNA damage
is regulated by DDR-induced PCNA posttranslational modifications, including RAD6/RAD18-dependent PCNA ubiquitination.
Indeed, TLS polymerases associate with monoubiquitinated
PCNA through UBZ or UBM ubiquitin binding motifs, which
then provide an additional PCNA interaction surface required
to target TLS polymerases to sites of DNA damage (Bienko
et al., 2005; Ulrich and Walden, 2010). Monoubiquitination of
the TLS polymerase h (Polh) has been proposed to promote
the intramolecular interaction between ubiquitin and the UBZ
domain of Polh, thus impairing its association with monoubiquitinated PCNA (Bienko et al., 2010). Whether PCNA K63-linked
polyubiquitin chains might serve as a signal to recruit factors
involved in error-free PRR is currently unknown.
A key question in this field for both RPA and PCNA, which
have many, many interacting factors, is how does the cell
decide which factor to recruit? It is possible that everything is
recruited simultaneously as a repair toolkit, and then the proper
tool is selected based on geometrical constraints at the damage
site. One parameter that could influence the selection of the
proper tool might be the amount of ssDNA present or whether
the recruitment is occurring in the context of a replication fork.
This remains a significant challenge to unravel in the future.
The Fanconi Anemia Pathway for Interstrand Crosslink
Repair
ICLs that covalently connect the two strands of DNA are a formidable bidirectional barrier to replication fork progression and
require no less than four incision events, TLS polymerases,
and recombination events to be circumvented (Figure 3B).
Central components of the ICL repair pathway are 13 genes
mutated in the genetic syndrome Fanconi anemia (FA) (Moldovan and D’Andrea, 2009). Eight of the FA proteins (FANCA, B,
C, E, F, G, L, and M) form the FA core complex, an E3 ubiquitin
ligase, with the addition of four associated factors (FAAP24,
FAAP100, and the heterodimer MHF1/MHF2) (Thompson and
Jones, 2010). The histone-fold heterodimer MHF1/MHF2 has
recently been shown to stimulate FANCM fork reversal activity,
whereas FAAP24 could target the FANCM complex to ssDNA
regions (Ciccia et al., 2007; Singh et al., 2010; Yan et al., 2010).
FANCM has DNA binding activity and has been implicated in targeting the core complex to DNA (Figure 3B) (Kim et al., 2008).
Moreover, FANCM has been suggested to associate with the
BLM complex and also contribute to the activation of the ATR
pathway at blocked replication forks (Collis et al., 2008; Deans
and West, 2009; Huang et al., 2010; Schwab et al., 2010).
The FANCI-FANCD2 Platform. The FANCI-FANCD2 (ID)
complex lies at the heart of the FA pathway and becomes monoubiquitinated on both subunits by the FANCL ubiquitin ligase
within the FA core complex (Moldovan and D’Andrea, 2009).
Once monoubiquitinated, the ID complex accumulates at sites
of crosslinks and colocalizes with three additional FA proteins,
BRCA2/FANCD1, PALB2/FANCN, and BACH1/FANCJ (Figure 3B) (Moldovan and D’Andrea, 2009). The DDR tightly regulates the ID complex through ATR-dependent phosphorylation

of both FANCI and D2 and several other components of the FA
core complex, like FANCM (Smogorzewska et al., 2007; Sobeck
et al., 2009). Phosphorylation of FANCI was recently shown to
play a critical role in promoting the monoubiquitination of
FANCD2 and itself, thus acting as a molecular switch of the FA
pathway (Ishiai et al., 2008). ID phosphorylation might facilitate
the recruitment of the ID complex to the FA core complex for
monoubiquitination. Monoubiquitinated ID complex is required
for the incision and translesion synthesis steps of ICL repair
(Figure 3B) (Knipscheer et al., 2009). The monoubiquitinated ID
complex promotes the recruitment of DDR factors required for
ICL repair. These include the newly identified FAN1 endo- and
exonuclease, which was shown to associate with the monoubiquitinated ID complex through a UBZ domain, and possibly the
MUS81/EME1 and XPF/ERCC1 nucleases (Kratz et al., 2010;
Liu et al., 2010; MacKay et al., 2010; Smogorzewska et al.,
2010). Monoubiquitinated ID could also recruit the TLS polymerases REV1 and Polz for the translesion step as they contain ubiquitin interaction domains (Moldovan and D’Andrea, 2009).
Factors involved in HR are also likely to be recruited subsequent
to these steps to repair the DSBs created in this process. Once
the lesion has been repaired, the ID complex is deubiquitinated
by the USP1-UAF1 complex, which also acts on monoubiquitinated PCNA when associated to the RFC subunit ELG1 (Cohn
et al., 2007; Lee et al., 2010c). The FA pathway is one of the clearest examples of how the DDR, through ATR/ATRIP localization
and activation at the sites of replication stress, controls the enzymatic toolbox of repair at the right time and location to promote
the appropriate repair event.
Additional DDR-Regulated Pathways
that Promote DNA Repair
dNTP Biosynthesis for DNA Replicational
Repair Processes
Deoxyribonucleotides (dNTPs) are required for many aspects of
DNA repair, and their levels are tightly regulated. In yeast through
humans, dNTP synthesis is increased in S phase to meet the
demands of DNA replication. However, occasionally, levels of
dNTPs are insufficient, in particular for DNA repair outside of S
phase. The enzyme ribonucleotide reductase (RNR), which
controls the rate-limiting step in the synthesis of dNTPs, is one
of the most highly regulated proteins in response to DNA
damage. RNR is a tetramer containing a dimeric small and large
subunit and is highly cell-cycle regulated (Nordlund and Reichard, 2006). The transcription of many RNR subunits is highly
inducible in response to DNA damage and replication stress in
eukaryotes. Mutations that decrease the activity of yeast RNR
or the failure to induce it result in sensitivity to DNA damage
(Elledge and Davis, 1989). Mammals induce a specialized small
subunit, p53R2, through the ATM/ATR-p53 pathway in response
to DNA damage (Nordlund and Reichard, 2006). While RNR is
primarily cytoplasmic, in response to DNA damage it is acetylated by TIP60 and is localized to sites of DNA damage in the
nucleus in a manner dependent on TIP60 (Niida et al., 2010). In
theory, this produces dNTPs at the site of repair synthesis
outside of S phase and may provide high local concentrations
of dNTPs required for optimal function of TLS polymerases
(Nordlund and Reichard, 2006).

Review
DNA Repair of Transcribed Regions
Active transcription can provide obstacles to DSB repair
because of possible collisions between the RNA polymerase
and the HR machineries. Formation of DSBs in the highly repetitive nucleolar rDNA has been reported to induce transcriptional
arrest and displacement of RNA polymerase I from rDNA in an
ATM-, NBS1-, and MDC1-dependent manner (Kruhlak et al.,
2007). The mechanism by which ATM regulates RNA polymerase
transcription has not been defined. However, several nucleolar
factors have been shown to be potential ATM/ATR substrates
(Matsuoka et al., 2007). Recent observations have suggested
that DSB formation leads to ATM-dependent repression of transcription in the vicinity of the DSB (Shanbhag et al., 2010). This
could be reinforced by histone methyltranferase complexes,
such as polycomb proteins, histone deacetylases (HDACs and
sirtuins), and DNA methyltransferases, which have been shown
to be recruited to sites of DNA damage (O’Hagan et al., 2008;
Polo et al., 2010; Chou et al., 2010). Transcriptional repression
could also be achieved by the RecQ helicase RECQ5, which
prevents chromosomal rearrangements by both inhibiting RNA
polymerase II and preventing excessive HR (Aygu¨n et al., 2008,
2009; Islam et al., 2010).
Bulky DNA lesions, such as UV-induced pyrimidine dimers, in
transcribed genes can lead to RNA polymerase II stalling (Hanawalt and Spivak, 2008). Removal of stalled RNA polymerase and
repair of these lesions is promoted by transcription-coupled NER
(TC-NER), which is initiated by the Cockayne syndrome proteins
CSA and CSB. Once RNA polymerase has been removed, the
repair of the DNA lesions is catalyzed by the Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) proteins (Hanawalt and Spivak, 2008). TC-NER is
distinct from global genome NER (GG-NER), which is initiated
by XPC and operates throughout the genome (Hoeijmakers,
2009). Following UV radiation, XPC is phosphorylated by ATM/
ATR and polyubiquitinated by the cullin ligase complex
CUL4-DDB1-DDB2; however, the significance of these modifications is still unknown (Bergink and Jentsch, 2009; Matsuoka
et al., 2007).
DNA Repair of Heterochromatic Regions
Heterochromatic regions, such as centromeric regions and inactive X chromosome in females, pose a particular problem to DNA
repair because of extreme chromatin compaction. Establishment and maintenance of heterochromatin is dependent on
H3K9me3 marks, which are recognized by the chromodomain
of the heterochromatin protein HP1 (Fischle, 2009). Recent
studies have shown that the chromodomain of HP1 is phosphorylated by CK2 after DNA damage, thus releasing HP1 from
H3K9me3 (Ayoub et al., 2009). Association of TIP60 with
exposed H3K9me3 through its chromodomain has been suggested to stimulate its acetyltranferase activity (Figure 1A) (Sun
et al., 2009). TIP60 acetylation of histones H3 and H4 could
then induce chromatin relaxation and facilitate the DSB repair
of heterochromatic regions (Sun et al., 2010). TIP60 could also
promote chromatin remodeling at DSBs by acetylating gH2AXmodified histones, which are then removed following ubiquitination by the UBC13 ubiquitin ligase (van Attikum and Gasser,
2009). TIP60 is also known to interact with ATM and stimulate
its kinase activity by directly acetylating ATM (Sun et al., 2010).
Activation of ATM leads to very rapid phosphorylation of the tran-

scriptional repressor KAP1, which accumulates at heterochromatic DSBs in a 53BP1-dependent manner, where it contributes
to chromatin relaxation (Noon et al., 2010). Moreover, 53BP1
interacts with the chromatin remodeling factor EXPAND1, which
induces chromatin decondensation at sites of DNA damage
(Huen et al., 2010a). Altogether, these observations point toward
a critical role of the ATM signaling for the repair of DSBs in
heterochromatin regions (Sun et al., 2010).
The DNA Damage Response and Human Disease
The central role of the DDR in human physiology is indicated by
the broad spectrum of defects displayed by individuals carrying
mutations in DDR genes. DDR genetic syndromes primarily
affect the homeostasis of the nervous, immune, and reproductive systems and can also lead to premature aging or cancer
predisposition (Table 2) (Jackson and Bartek, 2009). In this
section, we will describe the pathologies associated with DDR
defects.
Neurological Defects
The nervous system relies heavily on an intact DDR for functionality. Given that neurons display limited capacity of replacement,
they must overcome DNA damage lesions often on a lifetime
basis. Neurons exhibit high oxygen consumption by mitochondrial respiration, which can result in oxidative stress and subsequent DNA damage, such as DNA base lesions and DNA breaks
(Jackson and Bartek, 2009). Consistent with this observation,
defects in the regulation of oxidative stress and repair of DNA
lesions often result in neuronal death and neurodegeneration.
Several DDR syndromes affect primarily the cerebellum, which
is responsible for motor coordination (Table 2) (Katyal and
McKinnon, 2008). The cerebellum is composed of three classes
of neurons—granule cells, Purkinjie cells, and interneurons—
which account for approximately 50% of the neurons of the
whole brain (Katyal and McKinnon, 2008). Degeneration of cerebellar neurons often results in ataxia (impaired motor coordination), oculomotor apraxia (eye movement defect), and dysarthria
(speech disorder). One of the most extensively studied neurodegenerative diseases is ataxia telangiectasia (A-T), which is
caused by mutations in the ATM gene (Biton et al., 2008). A-T
patients develop profound ataxia due to the progressive loss
of granule and Purkinjie cells and are confined to a wheelchair
before 10 years of life. Similar symptoms, although characterized
by later onset and slower progression, are developed by patients
with the ataxia telangiectasia-like syndrome (A-TLD), which is
caused by mutations in MRE11. The similarity between ATMand MRE11-deficient syndromes is consistent with the previously described role of MRE11 in ATM activation. The mechanism by which ATM deficiency causes cerebellar degeneration
is still the object of extensive debate. ATM has been shown to
regulate oxidative stress, as indicated by the increased ROS
levels in the absence of ATM (Biton et al., 2008). Neurodegeneration could then be caused by excessive ROS-induced DNA
damage in ATM-deficient cerebellar neurons. Interestingly, treatment with antioxidant agents was reported to enhance the
survival of ATMÀ/À Purkinjie cells in vitro (Biton et al., 2008).
Moreover, A-T patients subjected to steroid therapy showed
improved cerebellar functions associated with reduction of
ROS levels (Russo et al., 2009).

Defects in repair of SSBs, one of the primary ROS-induced
lesions, have also been associated with cerebellar degeneration
and ataxia (Table 2). The neurodegenerative disorders ataxia
with axonal neuropathy (SCAN1) and ataxia with oculomotor
apraxia 1 (AOA1) are caused by mutations of the DNA end-processing enzymes TDP1 and APTX, respectively (Caldecott,
2008). TDP1 processes 30 ends linked to TOP1, which are
generated by abortive release of the topoisomerase from DNA,
and other nonligatable 30 ends induced by ROS and other
DNA-damaging agents, whereas APTX is a 50 end processing
enzyme that removes abortive ligation intermediates from
ssDNA and dsDNA ends (Rass et al., 2007). The helicase
SETX, which is mutated in ataxia with oculomotor apraxia 2
(AOA2), has also been linked to the repair of SSBs generated
by oxidative damage, but its precise role is still unknown (Rass
et al., 2007).
Accumulation of mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA),
which can lead to defects in oxygen metabolism and increased
ROS levels, has also been associated with neurodegenerative
disorders (Table 2). Indeed, mutations in the mitochondrial polymerase Polg and its DNA helicase TWINKLE have been identified
in the spinocerebellar ataxia-epilepsy syndrome (SCAE), which
is characterized by neuropathy, dysarthria, and epileptic
seizures (Copeland, 2008). Defects in Polg, TWINKLE, and the
RNR subunit RRM2B have also been linked to progressive
external ophthalmoplegia (PEO), a disorder leading to degeneration of the external eye muscle (Copeland, 2008). Mutations
and deletions of mtDNA have also been found in Parkinson’s,
Alzheimer’s, and Huntington’s diseases and amyotrophic lateral
194 Molecular Cell 40, October 22, 2010 ª2010 Elsevier Inc.

sclerosis (ALS), and they have been correlated with an increase
in oxidative damage in the brain (Druzhyna et al., 2008). ALS,
which causes progressive degeneration of motor neurons, resulting in paralysis, can be induced by mutations of the ROS
detoxifying enzyme SOD1 and the helicase SETX (Chen et al.,
2004; Valdmanis and Rouleau, 2008). Recently, genes causing
another motor neuron disorder, the Charcot-Marie-Tooth
(CMT) syndrome, which leads to myelination defects and motor
and sensory neuropathy, have been shown to prevent accumulation of DNA damage (Paulsen et al., 2009). Whether CMT genes
might prevent oxidative damage or might regulate other DDR
pathways has not been yet defined.
In addition to maintaining the homeostasis of the nervous
system, the DDR plays a critical role during brain development.
Indeed, a wide number of DDR syndromes display microcephaly,
a reduced head circumference resulting from defective proliferation of neuroprogenitor cells during fetal development (Table 2)
(O’Driscoll and Jeggo, 2008). Microcephaly is one of the typical
phenotypes of Seckel syndrome (SS) patients, in addition to
dwarfism and ‘‘bird-like’’ facial dysmorphism (Kerzendorfer and
O’Driscoll, 2009). Mutations of four different loci—SCKL1
through SCKL4—have been found in SS patients. SCKL1 SS is
caused by a hypomorphic ATR mutation that decreases ATR
protein levels due to aberrant splicing of the ATR transcript,
whereas the centrosomal protein PCNT, which has been shown
to function in the ATR pathway, is mutated in SCKL4 patients
(Kerzendorfer and O’Driscoll, 2009). PCNT mutations have
recently been found in the microcephalic osteodysplastic
primordial dwarfism type II (MOPDII), a disorder similar to SS

Molecular Cell

Review
(Kerzendorfer and O’Driscoll, 2009). Given that SS appears to be
a disorder of defective ATR pathway, the uncharacterized genes
responsible for SCKL2 and SCKL3 are probably novel ATR
pathway components. Another protein shown to mediate the
activation of the ATR pathway, MCPH1/BRIT1, has been shown
to be defective in patients with primary microcephaly (O’Driscoll
and Jeggo, 2008). Moreover, defects of the ATR pathway have
been proposed to cause the microcephalic phenotype of the blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome, MillerDieker lissencephaly syndrome, and the Williams-Beuren
syndrome, which are haploinsufficient for ATR, RPA1, and
RFC2, respectively (Kerzendorfer and O’Driscoll, 2009).
Microcephaly is also characteristic of the Nijmegen breakage
syndrome (NBS) and the Nijmegen breakage syndrome-like
disorder (NBSLD), which are caused by hypomorphic mutations
of NSB1 and RAD50, respectively (Katyal and McKinnon, 2008;
Waltes et al., 2009). Similar to SS, NBS and NBSLD patients
display growth retardation and ‘‘bird-like’’ face. These phenotypes are remarkably different from the A-T-like symptoms due
to MRE11 hypomorphic mutations in A-TLD patients, as
mentioned above. This might reflect the complex functions of
the MRN complex in both ATM activation and regulation of
ATR-mediated processes, such as replication fork stabilization
and restart. Therefore, the different impact of the hypomorphic
mutations in MRE11, NBS1, and RAD50 on the ATM or ATR
pathways might give rise to the distinct phenotypes of A-TLD
and NBS/NBSLD patients. Interestingly, it has been recently
reported that A-TLD mutant mice display loss of ATM-dependent apoptosis in the nervous system after DNA damage, thus
causing faulty incorporation of damaged cells in the brain,
whereas NBS mutant neurons still exhibit ATM-dependent
apoptosis, which could result in cell loss after damage and
microcephaly (Shull et al., 2009). Therefore, the level of ATM
residual activity in the brain might determine the outcome
between neurodegeneration and microcephaly.
Syndromes with defective HR, such as Bloom syndrome,
which is caused by mutations in the RecQ helicase BLM, or
impaired ICL repair, like FA and the XFE syndrome, which is
due to XPF mutations, lead to microcephaly (O’Driscoll and
Jeggo, 2008). Moreover, microcephaly could also be caused
by disorders that exhibit defective replication fork restart after
DNA damage, as the Schimke immunosseous dysplasia
(SIOD), which is caused by mutations of the SMARCAL1 helicase
or by NHEJ defective disorders with LIG4, XLF, or PNKP mutations (Driscoll and Cimprich, 2009; O’Driscoll and Jeggo, 2008;
Shen et al., 2010). Defective neuronal development is also
observed in Ku-deficient mice (Gu et al., 2000). Altogether, these
observations have led to the proposal that the developing brain,
and especially neuroprogenitor cells, might be particularly sensitive to the presence of DSBs, which could be formed following
replication stress or oxidative damage (O’Driscoll and Jeggo,
2008). Defective DSB repair could then lead to microcephaly
as a consequence of ATM-dependent apoptosis of damaged
neural cells. Interestingly, prenatal exposure to IR is known to
cause microcephaly in humans, as indicated by the reduced
brain size of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bomb survivors
that were in utero at the time of the radiation exposure (Fernandez-Capetillo, 2010).

Infertility and Immunological Defects
The DDR plays an essential role in the generation of gametes and
the development of the immune system. The generation of
gametes during meiosis requires the exchange of genetic material between homologous chromosomes, which involves the
formation of DSBs by the nuclease SPO11 and their subsequent
repair by HR (Neale and Keeney, 2006). Defective DSB repair
during meiosis results in infertility. A large number of DDR-deficient mice and various human DDR syndromes, such as A-T,
BS, and FA, display aberrant meiotic progression and infertility
(Table 2) (Biton et al., 2008; Bohr, 2008; Matzuk and Lamb,
2008). Given the requirement of a functional DDR for meiotic
progression, a significant proportion of human infertility could
be due to DDR defects (Jackson and Bartek, 2009).
The development of a functional immune system necessitates
the generation of a wide number of unique immunoglobulins and
T cell receptors. This is obtained by joining different combinations of variable (V), diversity (D), and junction (J) DNA sequences
through V(D)J recombination (Gennery, 2006). V(D)J recombination is initiated by the nucleases RAG1 and RAG2, which introduce specific DSBs at the segments to be rearranged. The
ends of the RAG1/RAG2 DSBs are generated as hairpin loops
that are opened by the nuclease ARTEMIS prior to end joining
by NHEJ factors (Gennery, 2006). Mutations of RAG1 and
RAG2 have been identified in patients with severe combined
immunodeficiency (SCID) caused by profound lymphopenia
with diminished or absent immunoglobulins (Table 2) (Sobacchi
et al., 2006). Similarly, ARTEMIS mutations give rise to SCID,
which is, however, accompanied by radiosensitivity (RS-SCID)
due to the role of ARTEMIS in the repair of radiation induced
DSBs (Gennery, 2006). Hypomorphic mutations of RAG1,
RAG2, or ARTEMIS have been found in the Omenn’s syndrome,
a less severe immunodeficiency disorder characterized by low
levels of V(D)J recombination and clonal expansion of limited
set of T lymphocytes (Sobacchi et al., 2006). Low immunoglobulin levels, lymphopenia, and radiosensitivity are also characteristic of the ligase IV and immunodeficiency with microcephaly
syndromes, which are defective in the NHEJ factors LIG4 and
XLF, respectively (Gennery, 2006). As mentioned above, LIG4
and XLF, unlike ARTEMIS, are also required for brain development, thus reflecting a more essential role of LIG4 and XLF in
NHEJ. No mutations in Ku70, Ku80, and DNA-PKcs, which are
all essential for V(D)J recombination, as indicated by the SCID
phenotype of knockout mouse models, have yet been reported
in human immunodeficiency syndromes (Brugmans et al.,
2007; Gennery, 2006).
Diversification of V(D)J variable domains is further achieved by
class switch recombination (CSR) and somatic hypermutation
(Stavnezer et al., 2008). CSR promotes the switch between the
constant regions of immunoglobulins, whereas somatic hypermutation introduces point mutations in the V(D)J variable
domains. Both CSR and somatic hypermutation are triggered
by the AID enzyme, which deaminates cytosines to uracil (Stavnezer et al., 2008). In CSR, DNA breaks are then generated by the
combined action of the uracil DNA glycosylase UNG and the AP
endonuclease APE1. Classical NHEJ or alt-NHEJ could then

syndrome, which is characterized by normal IgM levels but few
or no IgG, IgA, and IgE isotypes (Stavnezer et al., 2008).
Immunodeficiency has also been reported for A-T patients,
who display lymphopenia and decreased levels of IgG, IgA,
and IgE isotypes (Gennery, 2006). Indeed, it has been shown
that ATM stabilizes DNA repair complexes during V(D)J recombination and facilitates CSR (Stavnezer et al., 2008). Defective
CSR has also been reported for mice deficient for H2AX,
MDC1, 53BP1, and NBS1 (Stavnezer et al., 2008). Given that
other DDR syndromes with defects of the ATM pathway—
A-TLD, NBS, and the Riddle syndrome, which is due to
RNF168 mutation—lead to immunodeficiency resulting from
reduced efficiency of V(D)J recombination and/or CSR, the
ATM pathway appears to play an important role in the development of the immune system in humans (Gennery, 2006; Stewart
et al., 2007). Interestingly, the recently identified SIOD syndrome
leads to deficiency of T but not B lymphocytes (Boerkoel et al.,
2002). The specific role of the SIOD protein SMARCAL1 in
T cell development or maturation awaits further investigation.
Premature Aging and Stem Cell Exhaustion
Accumulation of DNA damage can lead to premature aging, as
indicated by several DDR syndromes with progeroid phenotypes
(Table 2). Deficiency in multiple DDR pathways, including NER,
BER, and DSB repair, has been linked to premature aging. The
progeroid syndromes Cockayne syndrome (CS), cerebrooculo-facio-skeletal syndrome (COFS), and trichotiodystrophy
(TTD) are caused by defects in TC-NER, whereas the related
cancer-prone syndrome Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP)—classified into eight complementation groups, XPA through XPG and
XPV—is associated with defects in GG-NER or TLS (Hoeijmakers, 2009). CS, which can be caused by mutations of the
TC-NER factors CSA and CSB, the TFIIH helicases XPB and
XPD, and the NER endonuclease XPG, is characterized by
hearing loss, cataracts, weight loss with muscle atrophy
(cachexia), and retinal defects associated with microcephaly
and neurodegeneration. Mutations in XPD, XPG, and CSB can
also be found in COFS, an early-onset form of CS with severe
symptoms apparent at birth (Garinis, 2008). Moreover, some
XPB and XPD mutations are associated with TTD, which has
symptoms similar to CS with the addition of brittle hair and nails,
and with an XP and CS combined syndrome (XP-CS) (Schumacher et al., 2008).
Deficiency in the RecQ helicase WRN leads to the development of Werner syndrome (WS), one the best examples of progeroid syndromes for its remarkable resemblance to normal aging
(Bohr, 2008). WS patients prematurely develop gray hair, osteoporosis, cataracts, type II diabetes, and atherosclerosis and
generally die in the fifth decade of life because of cancer or
cardiovascular diseases. Premature aging features, such as
gray hair and cataracts, have also been associated with the
Rothmund-Thomson syndrome (RTS), which is caused by mutations of the RecQ helicase RECQL4 (Chu and Hickson, 2009). It
has been proposed that WRN and RECQL4 might participate in
the removal of oxidative lesions by BER (Bohr, 2008). Moreover,
WRN can promote HR and telomere maintenance (Chu and
Hickson, 2009). Indeed, telomere shortening is known to lead
to DDR activation and induction of senescence (Sahin and
Depinho, 2010).
196 Molecular Cell 40, October 22, 2010 ª2010 Elsevier Inc.

The impact of telomere dysfunction on organismal aging is
further demonstrated by the progeroid syndrome dyskeratosis
congenita (DKC), which is due to mutations of the telomeraseassociated TERC RNA or its interacting protein DKC1
(Schumacher et al., 2008). DCK patients develop progressive
bone marrow failure and pancytopenia, accompanied by growth
defects, osteoporosis, and abnormal skin pigmentation due to
telomere shortening, resulting in the deprotection of telomeres
and the activation of the DDR. Bone marrow failure and pancytopenia are also found in FA patients, who additionally display
skeletal abnormalities, renal dysfunction, abnormal skin pigmentation, sensitivity to ICL agents, and infertility, as mentioned
above (Moldovan and D’Andrea, 2009). The bone marrow failure
in DKC and FA patients is probably due to exhaustion of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) caused by telomere shortening or
DNA damage, respectively (Park and Gerson, 2005).
Depletion of HSCs has been observed in a variety of mouse
models defective for DDR components, including ATM,
BRCA2, ERCC1, FANCC, Ku80, LIG4, MSH2, XPD, and mouse
telomerase RNA (mTR) (Niedernhofer, 2008; Park and Gerson,
2005; Sharpless and DePinho, 2007). Spontaneous DNA
damage accumulated in mice deficient for ATM, LIG4, XPD,
mTR, or Ku80 was shown to impair HSC self-renewal
(Niedernhofer, 2008). In ATM-deficient mice, HSC failure was
reported to depend on increased oxidative damage, which
induces the accumulation of the CDK inhibitor p16INK4A (Sharpless and DePinho, 2007). p16INK4A, which functions together
with the tumor suppressor Rb to induce cell-cycle arrest and
cellular senescence, has been shown to accumulate with age
in adult stem cells, thus reducing their regenerative capacity
(Collado et al., 2007). Deficiency of p53, which also regulates
cellular senescence, was shown to rescue many of the progeroid
features displayed in mTR-deficient mice due to defects of HSC
and stem cells from the intestinal crypt and testis (Sharpless and
DePinho, 2007). Similarly, the accelerated aging phenotypes of
mice defective for BRCA1, Ku80, and ZMPSTE24, a nuclear
membrane protease mutated in the Hutchinson-Gilford progeria
syndrome, were rescued by TP53 deletion (Sahin and Depinho,
2010). Deficiency of p53 in these mouse models led to increased
cancer formation, indicating that p53 rescues aging at the
expense of cancer. Interestingly, TP53 deletion was shown to
exacerbate the progeroid phenotypes of a SS mouse model
with ATR deficiency (Fernandez-Capetillo, 2010). Given that
the progeroid features of SS mice might be due to replication
stress during embryonic development, the increased proliferation rate induced by p53 deficiency could further increase the
amount of replication stress and therefore accelerate the aging
phenotype. Deletion of ATR in adult mice was also shown to
lead to stem cell loss and premature aging (Ruzankina et al.,
2007).
Analysis of several DDR mouse models, including mouse
models for SS, CS, and XFE progeria, have revealed a reduction
of the growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor 1 (GH-IGF1)
axis (Schumacher et al., 2008). Attenuation of the GH-IGF1
pathway is known to lead to extended life span and increased
stress resistance and occurs during natural aging. The
decreased function of the GH-IGF1 pathway after DNA damage
might represent an attempt to reduce further damage

accumulation by shifting the organismal resources from growth
to tissue maintenance (Schumacher et al., 2008).
Cancer Development and Therapy
Cancer is an evolutionary disease fueled by genomic instability
(Negrini et al., 2010). The majority of cancers display chromosomal instability (CIN), which is characterized by alterations of
chromosomal numbers and/or structure. Other forms of
genomic instability include accumulation of DNA base mutations
and microsatellite instability (MIN), which results in contraction or
expansion of the number of repetitive microsatellite sequences
(Negrini et al., 2010). Maintenance of genomic integrity by the
DDR is critical to prevent tumorigenesis, as indicated by the
cancer-prone phenotype of several DDR syndromes (Table 2).
Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), also known
as Lynch syndrome, is caused by heterozygous mutations of
MMR genes, such as MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and in fewer cases,
PMS2 (Spry et al., 2007). HNPCC is associated with MIN, which
predisposes primarily to the development of colorectal cancer,
with additional possible carcinomas of the endometrium, ovary,
stomach, and kidney. The risk of colorectal cancer is increased
also in the MYH-associated polyposis (MAP), which is caused
by defective repair of oxidative lesions due to mutations of the
DNA glycosylase MYH (David et al., 2007). The mechanism by
which deficiency of MMR factors and MYH preferentially affects
intestinal cells has not been determined. Instead, deficiency of
NER factors in the XP syndrome is known to greatly increase
the risk of skin cancer and melanoma because of defective repair
of UV lesions in skin cells following sun exposure (Hoeijmakers,
2009).
Familial breast cancer accounts for approximately 5%–10% of
breast cancer cases (Fackenthal and Olopade, 2007). The most
prevalent mutations leading to hereditary breast and ovarian
cancer affect the HR genes BRCA1 and BRCA2. Heterozygous
individuals carrying mutations of the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes
have a 40%–80% risk of developing breast cancer (Fackenthal
and Olopade, 2007). Patients with BRCA2 mutations have
increased incidence of male breast, pancreas, and prostate
cancer (Moynahan and Jasin, 2010). Tumors with BRCA1 or
BRCA2 mutations are significantly associated with low level of
53BP1, indicating that 53BP1 mutation might confer a survival
advantage in the absence of BRCA1 and BRCA2 (Bouwman
et al., 2010). This is probably due to partial restoration of HR in
BRCA1 mutant tumors, as previously described. Recently,
mutations in three additional HR genes, BACH1, PALB2, and
RAD51C, have been identified in approximately 3% of familial
breast cancer patients and have been associated with a 2-fold
increased risk of breast cancer (Levy-Lahad, 2010; Walsh and
King, 2007). Mutations of CHK2, ATM, NBS1, and RAD50
have also been associated with a doubled risk of breast
cancer, indicating the importance of the ATM pathway, together
with HR, in preventing breast cancer formation (Walsh and King,
2007).
The strong connection between familial breast cancer and FA
syndrome has recently become apparent (Levy-Lahad, 2010).
Indeed, BRCA2, BACH1, and PALB2 mutations predispose
carriers to breast cancer formation when monoallelic and lead
to FA syndrome—complementation groups D1, J, and N,
respectively—when biallelic. Similarly, biallelic mutations of

RAD51C have been identified in an FA-like disorder (Levy-Lahad, 2010). FA is also associated with increased cancer risk, in
particular for the development of myelodisplasia (preleukemic
syndrome) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (Moldovan and
D’Andrea, 2009). Hematological neoplasia is also found in A-T
patients (lymphomas and leukemias) and NBS patients (B cell
lymphomas) (Gennery, 2006; Spry et al., 2007). Some cases
of hematological malignancies, such as EBV-associated
lymphomas, have been associated with LIG4 syndrome and
RS-SCID defective in ARTEMIS (Gennery, 2006). The preferential
development of lymphoid tumors in A-T, NBS, and NHEJ defective syndromes is due to their critical role during lymphocyte
development. Lymphoid tumors are often caused by chromosomal translocations, which can lead to aberrant expression of
oncogenes, such as c-Myc, or generation of deregulated
chimeric proteins with enhanced activity (Nussenzweig and
Nussenzweig, 2010). Experiments in mice have shown that
NHEJ defective mice in the absence of p53 develop B cell
lymphomas harboring translocations between the Ig locus and
c-Myc, which are dependent on the unrepaired breaks created
by RAG1/RAG2 during V(D)J recombination (Nussenzweig and
Nussenzweig, 2010). Similarly, ATM deficiency was shown to
lead to persistent RAG-induced breaks, which could join other
DSBs, such as breaks induced by aberrant activity of AID, to
generate translocations and promote tumorigenesis (Nussenzweig and Nussenzweig, 2010).
A broad spectrum of malignancies is displayed by the DDR
disorders Bloom syndrome (BS) and Li-Fraumeni syndrome
(LFS). The high level of CIN of BS patient cells due to hyperrecombination can lead to the development of lymphomas, leukemias, and carcinomas (Chu and Hickson, 2009). LFS, which is
primarily caused by germline TP53 mutations, predisposes
carriers to breast cancer, brain tumors, leukemia, sarcomas,
melanomas, and gastrointestinal cancers (D’Orazio, 2010).
Sporadic cancers arise from the accumulation of stochastic
DNA lesions that increase the fitness of cancer cells. It is known
that early stages of human tumors have elevated levels of DNA
damage (Bartek et al., 2007). DNA damage could be generated
by exposure to carcinogens, as confirmed by the complex mutational signature identified in the lung cancer genome of a smoker
and in the genome of a malignant melanoma (Pleasance et al.,
2010a, 2010b). Moreover, DNA damage can be induced by telomeric shortening, increased oxidative damage, or replication
stress induced by oncogene activation (Bartek et al., 2007; Luo
et al., 2009). Activation of the DDR could normally prevent tumorigenesis by inducing cellular senescence or apoptosis of early
tumor cells (Bartek et al., 2007). However, mutation of DDR
genes, such as TP53 or ATM, could predispose carriers to
cancer formation by facilitating senescence and apoptosis
bypass and cellular proliferation despite accumulation of DNA
damage (Luo et al., 2009). Activation of p53 occurs in response
to multiple stimuli. However, it is likely to be its role in responding
to DNA damage that provides the majority of its tumor suppressive function, as demonstrated by the observation that more
than 50% of sporadic human cancers harbor somatic TP53
mutations and another 15% have ATM mutations in a mutually
exclusive manner, indicating that they function in the same
pathway (Ding et al., 2008).

Molecular Cell

Review
In an attempt to develop better cancer therapeutic
approaches, the concept of targeting nononcogene addiction
(NOA) for cancer therapy has recently been proposed (Luo
et al., 2009). This idea is based on the observation that the
cancer cells rely on many nononcogenic pathways, which are
not essential for the survival of normal cells. Therefore, targeting
NOA pathways would provide more selective cancer treatments.
In particular, given the elevated levels of DNA damage in cancer
cells compared to normal cells, further increasing the amount of
DNA damage by inhibiting DDR components, in combination
with other chemotherapeutic drugs, could lead to cancer cell
death. Indeed, recent studies have shown that ATM, DNA-PK,
and CHK1 inhibitors have preferential toxicity toward cancer
cells following treatment with genotoxic agents (Bolderson
et al., 2009). Interestingly, ATM and DNA-PK depletion have
been shown to sensitize TP53 and ATM mutant tumor cells to
genotoxic agents, respectively (Jiang et al., 2009). Moreover,
PARP1 inhibitors have been successfully used to treat tumors
that carry mutations in HR genes, such as BRCA1 and BRCA2
(Jackson and Bartek, 2009). This effect has been proposed to
be caused by the accumulation of unrepaired DNA breaks in
the absence of both PARP-dependent SSBR and HR. Recently,
methotrexate, an inhibitor of DNA base synthesis, has been
shown to selectively kill MMR-deficient cancer cells by leading
to accumulation of oxidative DNA lesions (Martin et al., 2010a).
Interestingly, depletion of the BER polymerase Polb and the
mitochondrial polymerase Polg was shown to be synthetic lethal
in combination with MSH2 and MLH1 deficiency in tumor cells
because of an increased number of oxidative lesions (Martin
et al., 2010b).
In summary, the coordination of DNA repair processes plays
a critical role in allowing the proper development and survival
of organisms. They are responsible for preventing numerous
human diseases and conditions, including cancer and aging.
We envision that the further understanding of the molecular
mechanisms through which the DDR operates, in combination
with the elucidation of the genetic interactions between different
DDR pathways and between DDR pathways and other cellular
pathways, will provide therapeutic opportunities for many human
diseases.
