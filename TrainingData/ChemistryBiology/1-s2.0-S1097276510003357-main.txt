SUMMARY

Expression of the INK4b/ARF/INK4a tumor suppressor locus in normal and cancerous cell growth
is controlled by methylation of histone H3 at lysine
27 (H3K27me) as directed by the Polycomb group
proteins. The antisense noncoding RNA ANRIL of
the INK4b/ARF/INK4a locus is also important for
expression of the protein-coding genes in cis, but
its mechanism has remained elusive. Here we report
that chromobox 7 (CBX7) within the polycomb
repressive complex 1 binds to ANRIL, and both
CBX7 and ANRIL are found at elevated levels in prostate cancer tissues. In concert with H3K27me recognition, binding to RNA contributes to CBX7 function,
and disruption of either interaction impacts the ability
of CBX7 to repress the INK4b/ARF/INK4a locus and
control senescence. Structure-guided analysis
reveals the molecular interplay between noncoding
RNA and H3K27me as mediated by the conserved
chromodomain. Our study suggests a mechanism
by which noncoding RNA participates directly in
epigenetic transcriptional repression.

INTRODUCTION
Transcription of the INK4a/ARF locus is tightly controlled in part
by Polycomb group (PcG) protein complexes that initiate and
maintain the silenced state (Gil and Peters, 2006). Initially identified as regulators of Hox genes during development, PcG
proteins and their activating counterparts, the Trithorax group
(TrxG) proteins, play an important role in gene silencing, development, stem cell self-renewal, and differentiation (Mu¨ller and
Verrijzer, 2009; Ringrose and Paro, 2004; Schuettengruber
et al., 2007; Sparmann and van Lohuizen, 2006). As negative
regulators, PcG proteins have been best characterized as two
multiprotein complexes, polycomb repressive complex 1
(PRC1) and 2 (PRC2). PRC2 contains EED, Suz12, and the lysine

methyltransferase EZH2 and initiates long-term repression of
target genes by trimethylating histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27).
PRC1, which typically consists of Bmi1/Mel18, mPh1/2,
Ring1a/b, and Pc/Chromobox (CBX), has been referred to as
the maintenance system of silenced chromatin; it is responsible
both for monoubiquitination at histone H2AK119 by Ring1b and
recognition of methylated H3K27 via the Pc protein. Mammalian
forms of PRC1 may achieve additional contextual specificity by
substituting for one of the multiple homologs of Pc/CBX. Of
the chromobox proteins, CBX7 has been characterized as a
regulator of cellular life span by directly repressing the INK4a/
ARF locus (Bernard et al., 2005; Gil et al., 2004). Consistent
with this, CBX7 is upregulated in follicular lymphoma (Scott
et al., 2007) and certain prostate cancers (Bernard et al., 2005),
although its downregulation or loss of expression in other carcinomas suggests a more complex scenario.
In recent years, noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) have been recognized for their major role in gene expression (Bernstein and Allis,
2005; Lee, 2009; Morris, 2009; Ponting et al., 2009; Umlauf et al.,
2008; Zaratiegui et al., 2007), believed to control gene silencing
by recruiting histone methyltransferases, such as by Air (Nagano
et al., 2008) and Kcnq1ot1 (Pandey et al., 2008), or by creating
a repressed nuclear compartment to which target genes are
relocated, such as by Xist (Chaumeil et al., 2006). Both short
and long ncRNAs can contribute to the recruitment of PcG
complexes to target genes and the regulation of PcG protein
expression (Hekimoglu and Ringrose, 2009; Khalil et al., 2009).
In mammals and Drosophila, RNA-directed regulation may be
dependent on direct interactions with PcG proteins such as
EZH2, Suz12, and CBX (Bernstein et al., 2006; Pandey et al.,
2008; Rinn et al., 2007; Zhao et al., 2008). Further, long ncRNAs
can be transcribed adjacent to or within PcG target genes of
which the expression of HOTAIR (Rinn et al., 2007) and Kcnq1ot1
(Pandey et al., 2008) is correlated with target silencing.
Given that CBX7 (and other CBX homologs) bind RNA in vitro
(Bernstein et al., 2006), we postulated that both H3K27me- and
RNA-binding activities might mediate CBX7 function, although it
is unclear whether these two modes of regulation are analogous
or cooperative. ANRIL is a long noncoding antisense RNA transcript overlapping the INK4b/ARF/INK4a locus (Pasmant et al.,
2007) (Figure 1A) with estimates of the transcript spanning over

30–40 kb in length (Mattick et al., 2009). This transcript promotes
and maintains the epigenetic state of the CDKN2B (INK4b) gene
and is an antisense transcript to INK4b (Yu et al., 2008), and
single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with ANRIL have
been linked to enhanced risk of atherosclerosis (Broadbent
et al., 2008; Samani et al., 2008). To determine whether ANRIL
is a signature transcript for docking PcG proteins, we sought
to characterize repression at the INK4b/ARF/INK4a locus by
Polycomb CBX7 in the context of H3K27me and ANRIL interactions. We show that, in vivo, CBX7 is specifically associated with
ANRIL, and levels of both are elevated in prostate cancer tissues;
in vitro, CBX7 employs overlapping yet distinct regions within its
chromodomain for binding to H3K27me and RNA. Introduction
of antisense transcripts to ANRIL, or structure-guided mutations
of CBX7 of PRC1 that disrupt H3K27me or RNA binding, affects
cellular life span. Our results demonstrate how PcG proteins
integrate the regulation of the INK4b/ARF/INK4a locus by two
epigenetic factors—histone modification and ncRNA.

reveal that expression of ANRILas-4, and to a much lesser extent
ANRILas-1, caused a marked increase in the expression of
p16INK4a over cells infected with the vector alone. The effects
on p15INK4b expression were much less profound, and tubulin
remained constant (Figure 2B). Notably, RNA transcript levels
of INK4a and INK4b following passages showed patterns of
changes similar to those of proteins (Figure 2C). Moreover, occupation of H3K27me3, CBX7, and EZH2 probed by chromatin
immunoprecipitation (ChIP) at the transcription start site (position III) in the INK4a gene (Figure 1A) showed a similar reduction
over the control, whereas occupation of H3K4me3 exhibited little
change if not a slight increase (Figure 2D). Finally, we observed
that ANRILas-4 competes effectively against in vitro-transcribed
ANRIL binding to nuclear proteins in a concentration-dependent
manner in an RNA electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA)
(Figure 2E). Taken together, these results strongly support the
existence of a direct role of ANRIL and ANRIL-associated factors
that reinforce transcriptional control and are critical in the decision to repress the INK4b/ARF/INK4a locus.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
ANRIL RNA and CBX7 Are Upregulated in Prostate
Cancer Tissues
Previous studies have shown that CBX7 is overexpressed in
some prostate carcinomas (Bernard et al., 2005), which may
collaborate with the overexpression of EZH2 (Varambally et al.,
2002). Therefore, we analyzed several tissue specimens from
prostate using quantitative PCR (qPCR) for expression of ANRIL
ncRNA and from INK4a, CBX7, and EZH2 genes (Figure 1B). In
comparison to preneoplastic (PIN) and untransformed (normal)
prostate epithelium tissues, we observed elevated expression
of ANRIL, CBX7, and EZH2 and a corresponding decrease in
INK4a expression. Higher levels of ANRIL expression were
seen in prostate cancer (PC3 and PCa) relative to normal prostate epithelial cells (Figure 1C) and other cancer tissues (data
not shown). RNA-FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization)
imaging helps visualize the elevated expression of ANRIL in
PCa, contrasting sharply with normal prostate cells where ANRIL
is undetectable (Figure 1D). Additionally, we detected ANRIL
coinciding with higher levels of occupancy of EZH2, CBX7, and
RNA polymerase II (Pol II) near the promoter regions of INK4a
and ARF in PC3 cells than in IMR90 diploid fibroblasts (Figure 1E). Collectively, these results argue that in addition to
both being upregulated in prostate cancer, CBX7 and ANRIL
expression are likely correlated. Further, within the region of
the locus separating the ANRIL and INK4a start sites, we
observed an inverse correlation of Pol II occupation, suggesting
a highly dynamic function of Pol II on the opposing DNA strand
that may negatively impact INK4a transcription.
To investigate whether ANRIL influences INK4a transcription,
we examined the effects of transcripts antisense to ANRIL on
life span of IMR-90 diploid fibroblasts, which were transduced
with retrovirus expressing each of two antisense cDNAs, one
(ANRILas-4) targeting a site upstream to ARF and INK4a, and
the other (ANRILas-1) upstream to INK4b (Figure 1A). Cell
population doublings were measured and showed a 2- and
1.5-fold reduction, respectively, compared to the control at
passage 20 (Figure 2A). Western blots of cells from passage 20

ANRIL RNA Is Associated with Polycomb Protein
Recruitment to the INK4a/ARF Locus
Using a modified RNA-ChIP method, we confirmed that CBX7
forms a stable association with endogenous ANRIL in vivo in
PC3 cells (Figure 3A). To ensure contextual RNA binding by
CBX7 in the PRC1 complex, we purified PRC1 from the nuclear
extracts of PC3 cells transfected with FLAG-tagged CBX7 and
confirmed CBX7 association with endogenous PRC1 by
MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and western blot analyses
(Figures 3B and 3C). An RNA EMSA using 50 -biotinylated ANRIL
transcript further demonstrates that the purified PRC1 forms
a stable complex with ANRIL but not an anti-ANRIL transcript
(Figure 3D, lanes 2 and 3 versus lane 6; Figure 3E); the former
can be competed off by a nonbiotinylated ANRIL (Figure 3D,
lanes 4 and 5). Based on genomic mapping of ncRNA association with CBX7, EZH2, and Pol II with RNA ChIP (Figure 1E), we
detected that the ANRIL transcript initiates at start sites
upstream of the INK4a and ARF genes on the opposing strand,
preceding previously reported start sites by several hundred
bases (Pasmant et al., 2007; Sharpless and DePinho, 2007; Yu
et al., 2008). Mapping of the start site of ANRIL transcription
by 50 RACE confirms its proximity to the promoter of INK4a,
which is also supported by the RNA ChIP analysis (see
Figure S1 available online). These results confirm that ANRIL
interacts with CBX7 of the PRC1 complex at the INK4b/ARF/
INK4a locus.
We then evaluated occupancy of CBX7 and other PRC
proteins on the INK4b/ARF/INK4a locus by performing ChIP
(Bracken et al., 2007) (Figure 1A). After treatment of PC3 cell
nuclei with ribonuclease A (RNase A), site occupation by
CBX7, PHC2, and Bmi1 of PRC1 as well as Suz12 of PRC2
was dramatically reduced, while total levels of H1 and H3
remained about the same (Figure 4A). Levels of trimethylated
H3K27 and ubiquitinated H2AK119, known as histone marks
associated with PcG-mediated repression, were also greatly
reduced at the corresponding CBX7 occupation sites. Moreover,
RNAi knockdown of genes encoding the key PRC1 or PRC2
proteins individually or in combination with EZH2 results in a

reduction of transcriptional repression of the INK4b/ARF/INK4a
locus (Figures S2A–S2C). Reinstallation of H3K27 methylation
in the EZH2 knocked down PC3 cells with controlled expression
of a H3K27 methyltransferase vSET (Mujtaba et al., 2008)
confirms the occupancy of CBX7, and to a lesser extent CBX8
but little if any CBX4, at the different sites in the INK4a/ARF
locus, as revealed by ChIP analysis (Figure S2D). Finally, the
depleted levels of CBX7 upon whole-cell treatment of
a-amanitin, a peptide inhibitor of RNA Pol II, support the notion
that the RNA associating with CBX7 is a Pol II nascent transcript
and is sensitive to Pol II inhibition more so at INK4a than at INK4b
(Figure 4B, I–IV). This result is consistent with in vitro transcription analysis of whole-cell nuclei isolated from PC3 cells treated
with a-amanitin, confirming that ANRIL is a nascent transcript
generated by Pol II (Figure 4C). Collectively, these data illuminate

a possible role of the ANRIL transcript in PcG recruitment and
control of the INK4a/ARF locus.
CBX7 Chromodomain Employs Structurally Distinct
Modes to Bind RNA and H3K27me
To confirm that CBX7 directly associates with RNA, we first
examined the in vitro interaction between purified CBX7 and
a 26 nt RNA identified from a modified RNA ChIP protocol using
antisera against CBX7 in HeLa cells. RNA EMSA shows that
purified CBX7 binds to this RNA, as does the chromodomain
alone (CBX7CD) (Figure 5A). Because CBX7CD binds RNA in
a manner similar to the full-length CBX7, and it is also the
methyl-lysine recognition module of PRC1, we continued our
in vitro studies with the chromodomain. CBX7CD binds RNA
but not DNA (Figure 5A), but does not exhibit preference for

different sequences of non-ANRIL RNA that we tested in vitro
(data not shown), despite the observed contextual binding specificity for ANRIL by CBX7 (Figure 3A). Nevertheless, the CD of
HP1g, which shares approximately 50% sequence similarity to
CBX7CD, does not bind RNA, while the CD of CBX8, the
homolog most similar in sequence (82%) to CBX7, binds
RNA more weakly than CBX7CD, as indicated by the reduced
intensity of band shifts (Figure 5A, right panel, lane 6 versus lanes
7 and 8). An EMSA dually stained for RNA (SYBR Green) and
protein (SYPRO Ruby) illuminates the RNA/CBX7CD species in
yellow in a concentration-dependent manner (Figure 5B). We
observed increased viscosity of the protein/RNA complex at
CBX7CD concentrations >0.8 mM, leading to decreased ability
of the complex to migrate through the gel. However, CBX7CD/
RNA binding is detected by reduction of free RNA signal (green
dye at the bottom of the gel) as a function of protein concentration. The affinity for CBX7CD/RNA binding is estimated to be
51 mM.
We next examined CBX7CD binding to RNA and methylated
H3K27 in 2D [1H,15N]-HSQC (heteronuclear single quantum
correlation) NMR spectra. Upon titration of an H3K27me3

peptide, some protein amide peaks shift slightly, while others
undergo line broadening (Figure 5C, left panel); the latter effect
was less severe with an H3K27me2 peptide (Figure S3A).
Because of this, we carried out detailed structural and biochemical binding studies (see below) using the H3K27me2 peptide.
Based on the extent of peptide binding-induced NMR resonance
perturbations, we observed a slight preference of CBX7CD for
H3K27me3 over H3K27me2, and H3K27me3 over H3K9me3
(Figures S3A–S3C). Biological significance for CBX7CD/
H3K9me3 binding, also reported in an in vitro study (Bernstein
et al., 2006), remains unclear. Consistent with the RNA EMSA,
CBX7CD binds RNA but not DNA (Figure 5C, middle panel), resulting in severe NMR line broadening at molar stoichiometry
of CBX7CD/RNA as low as 1:0.1, which is more profound than
that by the H3K27me peptide. Such an effect was noted
for RNAs of different lengths (data not shown), and the HSQC
spectrum was restored upon addition of RNase A (Figure 5C,
right panel), indicating that the CBX7CD/RNA interaction is
specific.
In an attempt to establish how this specificity is achieved, we
further analyzed a fragment of the target region of ANRILas-4

H3K27me2 binding site (Figure 6B), which was confirmed by
our nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) data. Indeed, NOEs were
only observed for residues 23–29 of H3, indicating the flexible
nature of the two ends of the peptide in the complex structure.
We next mapped the residues undergoing the strongest line
broadening at the earliest RNA titration points onto the structure
(Figure 6C) and found that while common residues are also perturbed in peptide binding, a distinct and contiguous surface perturbed in RNA binding is somewhat distal to the peptide binding
site.
We designed point mutations of CBX7CD to abolish either
H3K27me (F11A, W32A, W35A) or RNA binding (E14A, R17A,
K31A, K33A). These residues were chosen based on their location in the methyl-lysine binding site or their NMR resonance
perturbation upon RNA binding (Figure 6C, dark blue). From
comparative binding studies by EMSA (Figure 6D), NMR
(Figure 6E), and fluorescence anisotropy (Table S1), an R17A
mutation showed a nearly complete loss of RNA binding but retained H3K27me binding at a level comparable to that of the
wild-type. Conversely, a W35A mutation adversely affected
binding to H3K27me (Figure 6E), but not RNA (Figures 6D and
6E). Moreover, an R17AW35A double mutant exhibited inability
to bind either H3K27me or RNA (Figure S6A). We also evaluated
RNA binding by CBX7 fusions to the DNA binding domain of the
GAL4 transactivator (CBX7/GAL4) in nuclear extracts recovered
from HeLa cells and observed strongly reduced RNA-protein
complex mobility by both R17Q and R17QW35A mutants, but
not by wild-type or W35A mutant (Figure S1D). Finally, we ruled
out mutation effects on any major conformational changes in the
protein, as the HSQC spectra of the mutants show spectral
changes localized to the mutation sites (Figure 6E and
Figure S6B).

of interaction for the trimethyl group by CBX7CD is likely the

Relative Contribution of CBX7 Interactions
with H3K27me and RNA to Senescence Regulation
Consistent with our previous results, we observed that ANRIL
expression declined during serial passage of IMR90 cells,
correlating with increased levels of INK4a transcription as cells
reached senescence (Figure 7A). To dissect the effect of CBX7
interaction with H3K27me and RNA on its function, we expressed wild-type or mutant versions of CBX7 in MEFs
(Figure 7) or IMR90 cells (Figure S7) and analyzed their effects
on replicative life span and expression of the INK4b/ARF/INK4a
locus. Expression of wild-type Cbx7 (mouse) resulted in
extended cellular life span and increased cell growth as
observed in growth curves, colony formation assays (Figures
7B and 7C), or by quantifying BrdU incorporation at different
passages (Figure S7D). However, expression of a Cbx7
W35A mutant, which affects Cbx7 ability to bind to
H3K27me, resulted in premature growth arrest with characteristics of senescence, similar to the effect observed upon
expression of oncogenic RasV12. We also tested a Cbx7
R17A mutant, which specifically affects Cbx7 ability to bind
to RNA. Expression of this mutant resulted in extended life
span of MEFs when compared with vector-infected controls,
but cells did not grow as vigorously as those expressing
Cbx7 wild-type (Figures 7B and 7C and Figure S7D). The
defects in growth of the RNA binding-deficient Cbx7 R17A

mutant were more obvious in colony formation assays
(Figure 7C) and resulted in decreased BrdU incorporation
when compared to Cbx7 WT (Figure S7D). Analysis of the
effect of the different CBX7 mutants on the expression of the
products of the Ink4b/ARF/Ink4a locus by western blot or RTPCR (Figures 7D and 7E) showed that the W35A mutation
caused an upregulation of p19Arf, p16Ink4a, and to a lesser
extent p15Ink4b. Conversely, expression of Cbx7 wild-type
repressed p19Arf, p16Ink4a, and to a lesser extent p15Ink4b
when compared with vector-infected control cells. Consistent
with its effects on cell growth, the expression of a Cbx7
R17Q mutant resulted in less effective repression of p16Ink4a
and p19Arf compared to Cbx7 wild-type. Expression of
p15Ink4b was similar in Cbx7 R17Q infected cells to that in
the vector controls (Figures 7D and 7E). Similar results were
observed in the IMR-90 cells (see Figures S7A–S7C). Although
mutations affecting Cbx7 binding to H3K27me have a more
dramatic effect on cellular life span than those affecting its
ability to bind RNA, overall these data confirm that ablation
of either H3K27me or RNA-binding activity of CBX7 compromises its capacity to repress the INK4b/ARF/INK4a locus and
control senescence.

Concluding Remarks
Growing evidence argues that RNA,
particularly long ncRNAs, is actively
engaged in gene transcription (Hirota
et al., 2008; Sessa et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2008; Zhao et al.,
2008), but how ncRNAs function mechanistically in concert
with histone modifications in gene regulation has remained
elusive. Recently, PRC2, which methylates H3K27 through its
component EZH2, has been suggested to be recruited to its
target gene by virtue of its association with HOTAIR, a 2.2 kb
ncRNA in the HOXC locus (Rinn et al., 2007), which could be
a general mechanism for in trans recruitment of PRC complexes
at non-HOX loci. Our identification of the ncRNA transcript ANRIL associated with the INK4a/ARF locus argues that the
nascent ncRNA transcripts could be involved in in cis recruitment of PRC complexes for gene silencing. In this capacity,
long ncRNA likely functions as an architectural matrix in addition
to its instructional role to recruit and retain the PRC complexes at
the target gene locus (Bracken et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2008) in
conjunction with the spreading of chromatin structure compaction that is associated with gene repression. In principle, the
nascent RNA produced by Pol II may also recruit a H3K4 methyltransferase, identified as mixed leukemia lineage (MLL) of the
activating Trithorax complex (Trx) (Lee et al., 2007; Rinn et al.,
2007), which in turn recruits a JmjC family H3K27 demethylase
leading to a reversal of gene repression. We therefore propose

Molecular Cell 38, 662–674, June 11, 2010 ª2010 Elsevier Inc. 671

Molecular Cell
Mechanism of ncRNA ANRIL in Epigenetic Gene Silencing

a general model in which ncRNA, always present at the locus,
recruits both PRC1 and PRC2 to the target gene for silencing;
in balance with Trx, the modification, modification-mediated
interactions, and demodification of H3K27me is likely dynamically modulated by these multiprotein complexes (Jensen
et al., 2009; Ringrose and Paro, 2004) along with ncRNA
(Figure 7F).
It is interesting to note that in Drosophila, PRC1 can be recruited to PREs independent of the H3K27 methylation induced
by PRC2, and that repression might require H3K27me in regions
flanking, rather than within PREs (Jensen et al., 2009). It is
unclear, however, whether ncRNA is directly required for repression in this case, or whether the effects observed are due to
compromised recruitment to the locus. This argues that the
contextual specific binding of CBX7 to ANRIL we observed,
which may be manifested through RNA structure-mediated
interactions with the CBX chromodomain, is likely dictated by
other subunits of CBX7/PRC1 capable of binding RNA or even
other RNA-binding proteins, which together provide greater
complexity to the organization of ncRNAs in regulating chromatin
structure (Wilusz et al., 2009). This notion is supported by the
purification of PRC1 through CBX7 that identifies multiple
RNA-binding proteins (Figure 3B). Further studies are required
to determine their role in augmenting RNA-binding specificity.
In conclusion, our study reported here provides a molecular
mechanism of how ncRNA transcripts functionally coordinate
with the chromatin-associated factors that modify and interact
with H3K27 methylation, a repressive mark for gene transcription.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
RNA Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization
Prostate specimens received as a generous resource from the New York
University Langone Medical Center’s Department of Pathology (Drs. Eva
Hernando and Jonathan Melamed) were obtained with prior IRB approval
following all HIPAA guidelines. Ten millimeter sections were fixed in 4% formaldehyde, 5% acetic acid, and 150 mM NaCl prior to drying. Antisense RNA
probe preparation, probe denaturation, hybridizations, and detection were
performed using the FISH Tag RNA Red Kit (Invitrogen).
RNA Recovery and qPCR of ANRIL Transcripts from Human
Prostate Specimens
Frozen specimens recovered from dissected tissue surrounding normal
prostate epithelium, prostate intraepithelial neoplasias, and malignant prostate duct tumors as described above were prepared as total RNA using
QuantiTect Whole Transcriptome Kit (QIAGEN). qPCR was performed with
TaqMan probes and quantitation of ANRIL transcripts by SYBR Green
labeling.
Genomic Mapping of CBX7, EZH2, and RNA Polymerase II
across the INK4a/ARF Locus
Using standardized ChIP methodology and the MagnaChIP kit (Millipore), the
genomic mapping of CBX7, EZH2, and RNA Pol II was performed at the
positions relative to key transcript start sites overlapping the position of human
chr 9 (chr9:21,710,518-22,301,141). DNA isolated from ChIP experiments was
subjected to quantitation by real-time PCR using Brilliant SYBR Green master
mix (Stratagene). Primers were identified using Geneious Pro 4.0 for primer
alignment of genomic regions.
RNA-Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay
PC3 cells were cultured under normal growth conditions (Li et al., 2005).
Following UV crosslinking, isolation of chromatin from the treated PC3

cells was performed using standard nuclear chromatin isolation techniques
(Kuo and Allis, 1999). CLIP was performed using a previously established
procedure (Ule et al., 2005) with modifications.
RNA Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay
The fragment of ANRIL cDNA generated by reverse transcription PCR was
cloned into pTOPO into the correct orientation. Radiolabeled transcripts
were generated by in vitro transcription using the Riboprobe System with T7
RNA Polymerase (Promega) and [32P]-UTP (UTP, [a-32P]-3000Ci/mmol
10mCi/ml; Perkin-Elmer). Biotin UTP-labeled RNA transcripts were generated
using in vitro transcription translation (Promega) for detection by the LightShift
kit (Pierce).
50 Primer Extension Analysis of ANRIL Transcripts
Primer extension analysis was carried out with RNA isolated from nuclei of PC3
cells and using the primer extension system with AMV reverse transcriptase
(Promega). Isolation of nuclear RNA (hnRNA) from PC3 cells was carried out
using a cytoplasmic/nuclear RNA separation and preparation system (Norgen
Biotek Inc.).
In Vitro Transcription Analysis of ANRIL from Whole Nuclei
Whole nuclei from 5 3 107 PC3 cells were collected as described previously
(Walsh et al., 1987) and kept on ice. Nuclei numbers were obtained by staining
with 40 , 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and counted with a hemacytometer
using fluorescence microscopy.
NMR Structure Determination
The three-dimensional solution structure of the CBX7CD/H3K27me2 complex
(1:2 molar ratio) was determined in PBS buffer (pH 7.4) containing 5 mM DTT,
90% H2O/10% 2H2O at 25 C, using established 2D and 3D NMR methods
(Clore and Gronenborn, 1994). Distance restraints were obtained from 3D
15
N and/or 13C-edited, as well as 15N/13C-filtered/-edited NOESY spectra.
Dihedral angle and hydrogen bond restraints were derived from TALOS
analysis (Cornilescu et al., 1999), and the structures of the complex were
calculated using ARIA/CNS (Brunger et al., 1998; Rieping et al., 2007).
Retrovirus Production, Infection, and Proliferation Assays
Mouse CBX7 was cloned into the MSCV-iresGFP vector to express Cbx7-GFP
fusion protein. Retroviral production, infection, growth curves, colony formation assays, BrdU incorporation, and western blot and qPCR analysis of
members of the INK4b/ARF/INK4a locus were performed as described (Barradas et al., 2009; Gil et al., 2004). Growth kinetics and p16 expression in normal
diploid fibroblasts were performed using established methods.
ACCESSION NUMBERS
Accession numbers for the coordinates of the CBX7CD/H3K27me2 complex
structure and the NMR resonance assignments deposited in the Protein
Data Bank and the BioMagResBank are 2KVM and 16778, respectively.
