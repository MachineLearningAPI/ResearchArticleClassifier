The current great interest in preparing functional metal-organic materials is inevitably associated with
tremendous research efforts dedicated to the design and synthesis of new families of sophisticated multinucleating ligands. In this context, the N-donor triazole and tetrazole rings represent two categories
of ligands that are increasingly used, most likely as the result of the recent dramatic development of
“click chemistry” and Zeolitic Imidazolate Frameworks (ZIFs). Thus, azole-based complexes have found
numerous applications in coordination chemistry.
In the present review, we focus on the utilization of 1,2,3-triazole, 1,2,4-triazole and tetrazole ligands
to create coordination polymers, metal complexes and spin-crossover compounds, reported to the end of
2009. In the ﬁrst instance, we present a compendium of all the relevant ligands that have been employed
to generate coordination polymers and Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs). Due to the huge amount
of reported MOFs and coordination polymers bearing these azole rings, three representative examples
for each category (therefore nine in total) are described in detail. The second section is devoted to the
use of the bridging abilities of these azole ligands to prepare metal complexes (containing at least two
metal centers). Given the large number and the great structural diversity of the polynuclear compounds
found in the literature, these have been grouped according to their nuclearity. Finally, in the last section,
the triazole- and tetrazole-containing coordination compounds exhibiting spin-crossover properties are
presented.

1. Introduction
Triazoles and tetrazoles are aromatic ﬁve-membered heterocycles containing respectively three and four nitrogen atoms.
1,2,3-Triazoles have been known since the end of the 19th century,
when Werner and Stiasny described 2-phenylbenzotriazole 1oxide [1]. In 1937, the binding ability of the triazole ring was noted
[2], and the ﬁrst crystallographically characterized coordination
compound was reported in 1976 [3]. The isomeric 1,2,4-triazole
ring was ﬁrst mentioned by Bladin as early as 1885 [4,5]. The aptitude of the 1,2,4-triazole ring to bind metal ions was established
a few decades later [6], and the ﬁrst crystal structure of one of
the resulting adducts was published in 1962 [7]. In 1886, Bladin
proposed the term tetrazole for a ﬁve-membered heteroarene
including four nitrogens [8], and in 1910, the potential binding
of this heterocycle to metal ions was shown [9]. The ﬁrst tetrazole complex characterized by X-ray diffraction was described in
1971 by Mason [10]. It can be noticed that although the chemistry
of these three azole rings is known since about a century, their
coordination behaviour has not been extensively investigated [6].
Actually, structural reports of triazole- and tetrazole-based coordination compounds have become increasingly common in the
literature only since the early 1980s [11], and the present review
will tend to demonstrate the growing importance of these families
of nitrogen-donor ligands in topical ﬁelds of Inorganic Chemistry.
1,2,3-Triazole derivatives are typically prepared by a 1,3-dipolar
cycloaddition reaction between an alkyne and an azide [12]. This
cyclization reaction, also known as the azide alkyne Huisgen
cycloaddition [13,14], was developed in the early 1960s by Huisgen [15]. This reaction became highly popular when Sharpless and
Meldal separately reported its Cu(I)-catalyzed version, allowing a
dramatic improvement of both the rate and regioselectivity of the
process, yielding 1,4-disubstituted 1,2,3-triazoles under mild reaction conditions (Scheme 1) [16,17]. This copper-catalyzed reaction,

commonly named “click reaction” [18], has found many applications in various areas of chemistry [19–22].
1,2,4-Triazoles are usually prepared using either of two reactions, i.e. the Einhorn–Brunner reaction (Scheme 2)[23] and the
Pellizzari reaction (Scheme 3) [24]. The Einhorn–Brunner reaction
occurs between an alkyl hydrazine and an imide. This cyclization reaction is catalyzed by an organic acid, such as acetic acid
(Scheme 2) [25].
In the Pellizzari reaction, an acyl hydrazide is condensed with
an amide at high temperature (Scheme 3) [26].

Scheme 3. Preparation of 1,2,4-triazoles via the Pellizzari cyclization reaction [4].

Scheme 4. Preparation of tetrazoles using a three-component reaction.

Tetrazoles can be prepared through a cyclization process involving three reactant partners, namely an amine, triethyl orthoformate
and sodium azide (Scheme 4). This three-component reaction may
be carried out at high temperature [27], and can be catalyzed by a
Lewis acid like ytterbium(III) cations [28].
These three simple azole rings may act as polydentate ligands
since they exhibit potentially three or four nitrogen-donor atoms.
In addition, these small heterocycles may function as bridging
ligands, therefore allowing the preparation of (polymeric) coordination compounds with potentially interesting physicochemical
properties resulting from interactions between metal ions. This will
be illustrated extensively in the following sections.
The scope of the present review encompasses the utilization up
to the year 2009, of 1,2,3-triazole-, 1,2,4-triazole- and tetrazolecontaining ligands to prepare (porous) polymeric coordination
materials, metal coordination complexes and spin-crossover complexes.

its protonated form, this heteroarene can act as a dinucleating
ligand (␮2,3 - and ␮1,3 -binding modes; Scheme 5A). The deprotonated ring may function as a dinucleating (␮1,2 - and ␮1,3 -binding
modes; Scheme 5B) or a trinucleating ligand (␮1,2,3 -binding mode;
Scheme 5B), thus providing for a high versatility in the preparation
of coordination materials.
By the end of 2009, more than ﬁfty papers describing the
single-crystal X-ray structures of 1,2,3-triazole-containing coordination polymers were published (CSD version 5.30; November
2008 + 4 updates) [39], involving twenty different ligands (Fig. 2
and Table 1). For instance, the ﬁrst X-ray structure of a coordination polymer bearing this heteroaromatic ring was reported in 1981
[40], with the utilization of 1,2,3-benzotriazole (HL3; Table 1 and
Fig. 2) to prepare [Zn2 (L3)4 ]n exhibiting a three-dimensional (3D)
architecture.
The twenty 1,2,3-triazole-based ligands so far employed to generate coordination networks have been roughly classiﬁed in three
categories, namely the ligands containing a sole coordinative ring
(HL1–L6 in Fig. 2), the bridged ligands (L7–L16 in Fig. 2), characterized by the presence of two or more coordinative rings linked
by a spacer, and the mixed ligands (H3 L17–L20 in Fig. 2), having two or more donor groups (for example a triazole ring and
a carboxylic acid function). The names of all twenty ligands are
given in Table S1 (see Supporting Information). Table 1 summarizes
the metals with which the ligands depicted in Fig. 2 have formed
structurally characterized coordination polymers described until
the end of 2009.
As is demonstrated in Table 1, the number of polymeric coordination compounds including 1,2,3-triazole moieties is huge;
therefore, a representative example for each type of ligands will
be presented below.

2. Coordination polymers
Coordination polymers are hybrid inorganic/organic structures
formed by metal cation centers that are linked by organic ligands, in
form of one-, two- or three-dimensional architectures [29]. For the
past ﬁfteen years, this area of chemistry has received a great deal of
attention from the scientiﬁc community [30,31], especially after the
development of the so-called Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs)
[32], which are composed of two major components, namely a cluster of metal ions or secondary building unit (SBU), connected by an
organic linker [33]. Typically, MOFs are built from O-donor ligands
[32,34], but the use of N-donor linkers, such as azole-based ligands,
is increasingly reported [35,36], most likely because they allow the
preparation of inorganic/organic materials, like the Zeolitic Imidazolate Frameworks (ZIFs) [37], with exceptional chemical and
thermal stability [38]. Thus, triazole- and tetrazole-based coordination polymers have been exponentially described in the literature
since the early 2000s, as is demonstrated in Fig. 1. More than 950
crystal structures (end 2009) are found in the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD version 5.30; November 2008 + 4 updates)[39]
for coordination polymers with these three families of ligands (i.e.
1,2,3-triazoles, 1,2,4-triazoles and tetrazoles). Therefore, in the following three sub-sections, three representive examples for each
category will be presented in detail.

coordination polymers found in the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD version

2.1. 1,2,3-Triazole-containing ligands

Fig. 2. Non-exhaustive list of 1,2,3-triazole ligands (HL1–L20) used to prepare coordination polymers.

The hydrothermal reaction of Zn(OAc)2 ·2H2 O with 1,2,3benzotriazole (HL3) in water (pH 5), at 170 ◦ C under autogenous
pressure for ﬁve days, yields the compound [Zn(L3)2 ]n , which
exhibits a 2D layer structure (Fig. 3) [41]. This 2D network
is constituted of dizinc(II) units bridged by two deprotonated ␮1,2 -benzotriazolato ligands, that are linked to each
other through four deprotonated ␮1,3 -benzotriazolato ligands.
[Zn(L3)2 ]n displays a strong ﬂuorescence emission in the blue
region, which is ascribed to the ␲ → ␲* transition of the L3− ligand
[41].

The category of bridged 1,2,3-triazole ligands is nicely represented by the molecule 1,3-bis(1,2,3-benzotriazol-1-yl)propane
(L12). Indeed, the equimolar reaction of CuCl2 ·2H2 O with L12
in methanol at room temperature produces single crystals of
[Cu(L12)Cl2 ]n [42]. Fig. 4 shows a perspective view of the crystal
packing of this compound. The compound is formed by dicopper(II)
units doubly bridged by ␮-chlorido ligands. These dinuclear metal
moieties are connected to each other via four bridging L12 ligands,
generating a complicated two-dimensional network that exhibits
large 44-membered fused metallacyclic ring-systems as Cu6 (L12)4

entities (Fig. 4). This framework appears to be stabilised by ␲–␲
stacking interactions between the benzotriazole rings separated by
the Cu2 Cl2 units (Fig. 4) [42].
The ﬁnal group of 1,2,3-triazole ligands is beautifully illustrated
by a remarkable MOF obtained from 1,2,3-benzotriazole-5carboxylic acid (H2 L19). Actually, the solvothermal reaction of
Co(NO3 )2 ·6H2 O with H2 L19 in acetonitrile/water at 150 ◦ C yields
the hydrated MOF [Co3 (L19)2 (OH)2 ]·3.7H2 O [43]. Fig. 5A shows
the coordination mode adopted by the doubly deprotonated ligand L19− in this compound. The carboxylic part of L19− acts as a
bridging dinucleating ligand and the triazolate moiety binds three
cobalt(II) ions in a ␮1,2,3 -fashion (Scheme 5B). The metal centers are
further bridged by ␮-hydroxido groups, forming Co3 (OH)2 chains.
The interconnection of these chains via L19− linkers creates a neutral 3D framework, featuring 1D nanosized rhombic channels along
the crystallographic c axis (Fig. 5B).
Interestingly, this porous homometallic MOF material can be
easily dehydrated at 95 ◦ C and the resulting water-free nanoporous
MOF is stable up to 310 ◦ C. Furthermore, the original hydrated
phase shows ferrimagnetism (through its ferrimagnetic cobalt
hydroxide chains) and single-chain-magnet like behaviour while
the dehydrated MOF exhibits ﬁeld-induced metamagnetism from
antiferromagnetism to ferrimagnetism [43]. This host material

represents an outstanding case of guest-induced switching of
(magnetic) properties, which is one of the potential, promising
developments of MOF chemistry.
2.2. 1,2,4-Triazole-containing ligands
Compared to 1,2,3-triazoles, a signiﬁcantly larger variety of
1,2,4-triazole-based ligands have been used so far to prepare
polymeric coordination networks. Similarly to 1,2,3-triazole, the
1,2,4-triazole ring can bridge metal ions through ﬁve different coordination modes, as is demonstrated in Scheme 6. Thus, protonated
1,2,4-triazole may function as a dinucleating ligand (␮1,2 - and ␮2,4 binding modes; Scheme 6A) while deprotonated 1,2,4-triazolate
can coordinate two or three metal ions (␮1,2 - and ␮1,4 - and ␮1,2,4 binding modes; Scheme 6B).
All these bridging coordination types provide inﬁnite possibilities for the design and preparation of hybrid inorganic/organic
architectures. Coordination polymers presenting 1,2,4-triazole
units were initially reported in 1979 by Engelfriet and co-workers,
who described the ﬁrst crystal structures of the isomorphous 2D compounds [Cu(HL21)(NCS)2 ]n , [Zn(HL21)(NCS)2 ]n and
[Co(HL21)(NCS)2 ]n [44]. Since then, 82 distinct 1,2,4-triazolecontaining ligands (whose names are listed in Table S2; see Supporting Information) have been employed to synthesize polymeric
coordination frameworks, giving rise to the publication of about
300 articles by the end of 2009 (Table 2).
As for the 1,2,3-triazole ligands, the 1,2,4-triazole-based ligands
have been organized in three categories, namely those containing a
sole coordinative ring (HL21–L39), the bridged ligands (L40–L62),
possessing two or more coordinative rings linked by a spacer,
and the mixed ligands (L63–HL102), having two or more functional groups. Table 2 summarizes the metals with which the

1,2,4-triazole ligands reported until 2009 have formed structurally
characterized coordination polymers.
The 1,2,4-triazole ligands of the ﬁrst group (HL21–L39) are
depicted in Fig. 6.
An illustrative example for the ﬁrst group of ligands (depicted
in Fig. 6) is obtained by reaction of the simple 1,2,4-triazole ring
(HL21) with CuSO4 ·5H2 O in water, at 200 ◦ C for two days [45].
This hydrothermal reaction leads to the formation of [Cu3 (␮3 OH)(L21)3 (OH)2 (H2 O)4 ]n ·4.5n(H2 O), featuring a triangular CuII
complex (Fig. 7A) acting as the building block of a 3D framework
(Fig. 7B). This microporous MOF encompasses a considerable solvent accessible volume in its channels along the crystallographic a
axis (Fig. 7B), and exhibits host–guest properties [45]. In addition,
this material shows unusual magnetic behaviour, with the presence
of both intra- and intercluster antiferromagnetic interactions.
The second group of 1,2,4-triazole-based ligands (L40–L62) is
shown in Fig. 8. A remarkable coordination material exemplifying
this category is achieved by reaction of Cu(NO3 )2 ·2.5H2 O with the
ligand 1,4-bis(1,2,4-triazol-4-yl)benzene (L51) in water at 130 ◦ C
[46].
The resulting porous coordination polymer, i.e. [Cu2 (␮L51)4 (␮4 -L51)]n (NO3 )4n ·2nH2 O, shows a crystal arrangement
driven by the intercalating packing principle (Fig. 9). The L51
ligands display two distinct coordination modes, namely a
tetradentate (␮4 -L51; light grey ligands in Fig. 9A and B) and a
N1,N2-bidentate (␮-L51; dark grey ligands in Fig. 9A and B) coordination fashion with a ratio of 1: 4, respectively. The ␩2 -triazole
(␩2 -trz) units self-assemble with copper(II) ions to generate 1D
[Cu2 (␩2 -trz)3 ]n inﬁnite chains along the crystallographic c axis
(Fig. 9B). In the perpendicular direction (i.e. along the crystallographic b axis), the coordination chains are connected by means of
␮4 -L51 ligands leading to 2D zigzag sheets (Fig. 9B) [46]. These 2D
layers are linked to each other through noncovalent ␲–␲ interactions (see rectangle in Fig. 9C; the closest intermolecular contact
˚ between the intercalated uncoordinated trz-C6 H4 arms
is 3.455 A)
(dark grey L51 ligands in Fig. 9A and 9B). This structural organization results in a framework in which each Cu-axis is surrounded
by six triangular channels of two kinds, whose corresponding edge
distances between the copper vertices are 15.8 × 16.1 × 16.1 A˚ 3 and
13.2 × 13.2 × 15.8 A˚ 3 (Fig. 9C). The voids between the layers are
ﬁlled by uncoordinated nitrate anions and water molecules. Interestingly, one half of the NO3 − ions, occupying the smaller channels,
are located above and below the phenylene rings of the tetradentate L51 ligands (circles in Fig. 9C), forming anion–pi–anion[47,48]
˚
double-stacks (nitrate···arene contact distance of 3.46 A).
Fourty ligands compose the last category, namely the mixed
1,2,4-triazole ligands (L63–HL102; Fig. 10).
This category of ligands is well represented by 4-(3-pyridinyl)1,2,4-triazole (L64). Actually, the reaction between Cu(BF4 )2 ·6H2 O,
L64 and excess NaClO4 ·2H2 O in water/ethanol/acetonitrile for

6 h produces the coordination polymer {[Cu3 (␮3 -L64)3 (␮3 O)(H2 O)3 ](ClO4 )4 ·4.5H2 O}n (Fig. 11) [49]. The self-assembly of the
bifunctional ligand and copper(II) ions leads to the formation of
Cu24 (L64)12 cages (Fig. 11B and C). This framework is built from
trinuclear Cu3 (␮3 -O)(L64)6 units with three-fold symmetry. These
tricopper(II) complexes, bridged by the ␮-triazole rings of three
L64 ligands, are connected to each other through the pyridyl donor
group of the L64 ligands (Fig. 11A).
The M24 L12 cage building units are linked by extra ligands to
yield an extended 3D framework with formula Cu24 (L64)24 that
exhibits a CaB6 topology (Fig. 12A) [49]. The volume of the cavity is about 1.6 nm3 ; this nano-sized M24 L12 cage hosts 16 large
anions (ClO4 − ). Interestingly, this material possesses remarkable
anion-exchange properties (BF4 − ↔ ClO4 − , Fig. 12B) [49], which is
one of the very interesting, potential applications of coordination
polymers.
2.3. Tetrazole-containing ligands
The last family of azole ligands described in the present review,
namely the tetrazoles, hold an additional nitrogen atom. Consequently, compared to the triazole rings, the tetrazole unit exhibits
more bridging coordination possibilities, i.e. 10 different coordination modes (Scheme 7). Thus, neutral tetrazole may function

both as a dinucleating ligand (␮2,3 -, ␮2,4 -, and ␮3,4 -binding modes;
Scheme 7A) and a trinucleating ligand (␮2,3,4 -binding mode;
Scheme 7A). Deprotonated tetrazolate can bridge two, three and
up to four metal ions (dinucleating ␮1,2 -, ␮2,3 - and ␮1,3 -, trinucleating ␮1,2,3 - and ␮1,2,4 -, and tetranucleating ␮1,2,3,4 -binding modes;
Scheme 7B).
These numerous bridging coordination modes afford great
synthetic possibilities for the design and preparation of hybrid inorganic/organic architectures. In fact, by the end of 2009, no less
than 90 tetrazole-based ligands have been described in more than
160 publications. Table 3 summarizes the metals with which these
tetrazole ligands (whose names are listed in Table S3) have formed
structurally characterized coordination polymers. The ﬁrst X-ray
structures of coordination polymers obtained from tetrazole ligands were reported in 1982. Thus, Yu and co-workers described the
solid-state structure of the 3D framework [Hg(L122)2 ]n . The same
year, Pierce-butler reported the crystal structure of [Pb2 (L141)(␮OH)2 ]n , which reveals a 2D sheet network [50].
As done earlier for the triazole-based ligands, the tetrazoles
have been classiﬁed in three categories, namely those containing a sole coordinative ring (HL103–L124), the bridged ligands
(H2 L125–H4 L147), possessing two or more coordinative rings
linked by a spacer, and the mixed ligands (HL148–L192), having
two or more functional groups.

Fig. 8. Non-exhaustive list of bridged 1,2,4-triazole ligands (L40–L62) used to prepare coordination polymers.

The tetrazole ligands of the ﬁrst group (HL103–L124) are
depicted in Fig. 13. An excellent example for this ﬁrst category of
ligands is provided by the layering reaction of an ethanolic solution of the simple tetrazole ring (HL103) with an aqueous solution
of silver(I) nitrate (1.5 equiv.), at room temperature for 2 h [51]. A
double salt, namely Ag(L103)·AgNO3 , is obtained that consists of
a non-interpenetrated 3D cationic framework with large channels.
This structural architecture contains triconnected and biconnected
silver centers (Fig. 14A) in a 2:1 ratio. The metal ions are linked by
exo-tetradentate L103− anions, generating single undulated layers
of (4·82 ) topology, which are connected through N–Ag–N bridges
to produce a 3D network with large channels along the crystallographic c axis, containing nitrate anions (Fig. 14B). This hybrid
organic/inorganic material is stable up to 248 ◦ C, thus demonstrating that tetrazoles can be used to prepare robust interesting
polymeric networks, which may be used as anion exchangers.
The bridged tetrazole-containing ligands (H2 L125–H4 L147)
used to prepare coordination polymers are shown in Fig. 15.
A beautiful example for this category of ligands is achieved with
the ligand 1,4-bis(tetrazol-5-yl) benzene (H2 L137). Thus, Long and
co-workers have used this bis-tetrazole ligand to synthesize a series
of remarkable porous MOFs with BET surface areas in the range
200–640 m2 g−1 [52]. For instance, the reaction of Zn(NO3 )2 ·6H2 O
with H2 L137 in methanol/dimethylformamide (1/1; vol/vol), at
room temperature for 4 days, produces large, colorless crystals
of [Zn3 (L137)3 (DMF)4 (H2 O)2 ]n ·3.5nCH3 OH [52]. Its single-crystal

structure contains linear Zn3 units linked via L1372− bridges to
form a neutral, 3D architecture (Fig. 16). The Zn3 complex consists of a central, octahedral Zn2+ ion coordinated by six tetrazolate
nitrogen atoms (␮2,3 -binding mode) and two outer Zn2+ ions, each
octahedrally coordinated by three tetrazolate nitrogen atoms, two
dimethylformamide molecules, and one water molecule (Fig. 16A).
The trizinc(II) moieties and the linear L1372− ligands self-assemble
to generate a 4,6 3D net, deﬁning inﬁnite 1D channels (Fig. 16B),
which are occupied by dimethylformamide, water, and disordered
methanol molecules [52].
[Zn3 (L137)3 (DMF)4 (H2 O)2 ]n ·3.5nCH3 OH exhibits an estimated
surface area of 640 m2 g−1 . Once degassed under mild conditions,
this material with permanent porosity can uptake 1.46 wt% of H2 .
These results clearly demonstrate the utility of tetrazoles for producing robust MOFs with permanent porosity, and with topologies
and gas adsorption properties comparable to those of the pioneering, carboxylate-based MOF materials.
The last category, i.e. the mixed ligands (Fig. 17), is elegantly
represented by the trifunctional ligand 5-(tetrazol-5-yl)isophthalic
acid (H3 L187).
The solvothermal reaction between Cu(NO3 )2 ·2.5H2 O and
H3 L187 in dimethylformamide/ethanol at 85 ◦ C for 12 h, produces
the 3D compound [Cu6 O(L187)3 (H2 O)9 (NO3 )]n ·15nH2 O [53]. The
single-crystal structure of this compound reveals that both the
carboxylato and tetrazolato groups of deprotonated L1873− act
as bridging dinucleating ligands, thus coordinating 6 copper(II)

ions (Fig. 18A). The two carboxylato units of L1873− generate
[Cu2 (O2 CR)4 ] paddlewheels (Fig. 18B), and the triazolate moiety
is involved in the formation of trigonal [Cu3 O(N4 CR)3 ] trimers
(Fig. 18C).
24 Functionalized isophthalate ligands are connected by 12 copper dimer centers, i.e. [Cu2 (O2 CR)4 ] paddlewheels, to form ﬁnite
truncated cuboctahedra, which are linked through the trigonal
[Cu3 O(N4 CR)3 ] trimeric Secondary Building Blocks (SBBs). This selfassembly results in a 24-connected rhombicuboctahedral Tertiary
Building Unit (TBU). Thus, the TBU are formed via the isophthalate unit, linked to 12 neighboring TBUs (Fig. 18B) through 24
3-connected trigonal SBUs (tricopper(II) complexes; Fig. 18C). The
resulting MOF is a (3,24)-connected network having rht-like topology. This porous material is characterized by large 1D channels
(along all three crystallographic axes; Fig. 19). The total solventaccessible volume for this material was estimated to be 75% [53].
The large accessible cavities and its cationic nature make this
framework a potential porous material for gas storage, like H2 .
Actually, up to 2.4 wt% of H2 can be uptaken by this compound
at 77 K and atmospheric pressure.

thirds are made with 1,2,4-triazole derivatives, whereas only about
8% involve tetrazoles. The predominant nuclearity is dinuclear (40%
of compounds), followed by trinuclear (19%) and pentanuclear (6%).
The analysis is organized according to the number of metal centers
of the molecule, starting from the smallest systems. Many of the
ligands discussed in this section have already been seen in the previous section and are represented in ﬁgures of that section. Ligands
not yet shown are collected on Fig. 20.
3.1. Dinuclear complexes

3. Metal complexes

The dominance of this nuclearity for the ligands reviewed here
is caused by the tendency of triazole and tetrazole rings to show
the [M–N–N–M] bridging moiety (see Schemes 5–7), most often in
the absence of conditions that could lead to further growth of the
complex. This moiety, however, is less common with 1,2,3-triazole
ligands, and has been found within dinuclear systems only in
the complex [Cu2 (L7)4 Cl4 ] (Fig. 21) [54], involving a 1-substituted
methylpyridine benzotriazole (L7), which acts as bridging as well
as chelating ligand. It needs to be mentioned at this point that the
[M–N–N–M] fragment is extremely commonplace among discrete
complexes of ligands containing a pyrazole fragment (596 hits on
the CSD). This area is, however, not the topic of this review.

Ligands bearing the triazole (any of its two isomers) or the tetrazole ring have served to help stabilize molecular complexes of
transition metals exhibiting a large variety of structures and nuclearities, the latter ranging from 2 to 26. We show in this section an
overview of the various structural types obtained with 3d metals,
based primarily on a search on the Cambridge Structural Database
(CSD version 5.30; November 2008 + 4 updates) [39]. Together with
this we include a brief discussion of the magnetic properties arisen
from these compounds. We employ during this description the
H = −2JSi Sj convention for the phenomenological description of the
magnetic coupling. Of the circa 216 species examined, nearly two

3.1.1. Dinuclear complexes with triple [–N–N–] bridge
A family of at least seven dinuclear complexes exhibiting
a triple [–N–N–] bridge has been identiﬁed, all of them with
1,2,4-triazole. All these compounds contain a pair of six coordinate M(II) centers: we have found this structure for the case of
Ni(II), [Ni2 (L193)4 (NCS)4 (H2 O)] [55] and [Ni2 (L31)3 (tp)2 (H2 O)4 ]
(H2 tp = terephthalic acid) [56]; Co(II), [Co2 (L194)4 (NCS)4 (H2 O)]
[57], [Co2 (L195)5 (NCS)4 ] [58] and [Co2 (L31)6 (tp)2 (H2 O)4 ] [56];
Mn(II), [Mn2 (L196)5 (NCS)4 ] (Fig. 22) [59] and Fe(II) (see Section 4). In these complexes, the 1,2,4-triazole rings are disposed
with their plane parallel to the molecular axis and with mutual

dihedral angles of approximately 120◦ , as in a paddlewheel
(Fig. 22).
The three fac coordination sites remaining on the external side
of each metal are occupied by anionic ligands (compensating the
charge of the metals), solvent molecules and/or the corresponding triazole acting as a monodentate ligand. The ␮-triazole units
keep the metals separated by distances that range from 3.747 A˚
([Ni2 (L31)3 (tp)2 (H2 O)4 ]) [56] to 4.139 A˚ ([Mn2 (L196)5 (NCS)4 ])
[59]. It is worth noting that this list of compounds is relatively small
compared with the series of related trinuclear complexes comprising three metals disposed linearly, also linked to each other by
triple [–N–N–] bridges (see below). The reasons for the formation of
either the dinuclear or the trinuclear system are not clear. It is likely
that the [M2 ] and [M3 ] species co-exist in solution (perhaps along
with larger oligomers) while the compound ﬁnally obtained is the
one that crystallizes or precipitates ﬁrst or better. The magnetic
properties of these complexes when the metal is cobalt, have been
studied and reviewed [60]. This has allowed studying the interaction through the triple bridge independently of other inﬂuences
(such as the possible coupling between both external metals in the
trinuclear analogues). The coupling was always antiferromagnetic,
and in general, weaker than for the pyrazole-based analogues. The
reason is, presumably, the electron withdrawing effect of substituting a carbon atom in the ring by a more electronegative nitrogen
atom [60].

3.1.2. Dinuclear complexes with double [–N–N–] bridge
The longest list of dinuclear compounds corresponds to
complexes showing two ␮1,2 bridging moieties (from trior tetrazole ligands), in most cases as the only type of
bridge between metals. There are however a few complexes
exhibiting a molecule of H2 O as an additional bridge. This
is the case of [Cu2 (HL30)2 (SO4 )(H2 O)5 ](SO4 ) (Fig. 23) [61],
[Ni2 (L33)4 (H2 O)5 ](SO4 )2 [62], [Ni2 (L32)2 (piv)4 (H2 O)3 ] [63] and
[Ni2 (L33)2 (piv)4 (H2 O)] (Hpiv = pivalic acid) [63]. The copper complex (Fig. 23) exhibits one square pyramidal and one octahedral
Cu(II) center.
The magnetic coupling between both Cu(II) ions (J = −47.2 cm−1 )
results from the direct overlap between the dx2 −y2 magnetic orbitals
of the metals and the ␴-orbitals of the triazole bridges. The nickel
systems show the metallic centers in the octahedral geometry,
with terminal ligands (H2 O, L33 or piv− ) completing their coordination sphere. In complex [Ni2 (L33)2 (piv)4 (H2 O)], two of the
terminal piv− ligands act as chelates to the Ni(II) centers. This
compound and [Ni2 (L32)2 (piv)4 (H2 O)3 ] exhibit similar magnetic
coupling (J = −6.88 and −5.63 cm−1 , respectively) and they constitute the only examples with this core where the magnetic exchange
has been investigated.
When both metals are linked only by two ␮1,2 -azole bridges,
these occupy almost always, two equatorial positions of each metal.
The outer equatorial sites are often occupied by substituents on the

heterocycles while the axial sites are usually ﬁlled by monodentate ligands (in general, anions or solvent molecules). Both azole
rings are generally disposed, together with the metallic centers,
approximately in a planar arrangement. Signiﬁcant deviations from
planarity only occur when the assembly lacks sufﬁcient degrees
of freedom and is structurally constrained. This might happen for
example if the tri- or tetrazole rings are integrated within a macrocyclic structure, as observed in the complex [Co2 (L98)Cl2 ] (Fig. 24)
[64].
The ligand H2 L98 is a macrocycle containing two facially disposed 1,2,4-triazole rings, and four imine functions, suited for the
encapsulation of transition metal ions. In the complex, two Co(II)
ions are trapped through their coordination to this ligand. The Co–N
distances however, are too long for the metals to ﬁt perfectly within
the cavities of the ligand (averages of 2.07 and 2.13 A˚ for distances
to Ntriaz and Nimin , respectively), forcing them to lie slightly away
from their respective equatorial planes. A consequence of this is the
bending of the bridging triazole rings with respect to one another,
exhibiting an almost right dihedral angle (85.52◦ ). By contrast,
the Co(III) quasi-analogue, [Co2 (L98)Cl2 (CH2 NO2 )2 ] (Fig. 25) [64],
which involves smaller metals and thus shorter Co–N distances
˚ respectively), has the cations perfectly
(averages of 1.83 and 1.93 A,
accommodated within the ligand cavities, the whole assembly
exhibiting a very ﬂat conﬁguration.
The Cu(II) complexes of H2 L98, [Cu2 (L98)(MeCN)2 ](ClO4 )2 and
[Cu2 (L98)(NCS)2 ] also display bent conﬁgurations [65]. Shorter
coordination bonds (with average distances of 1.968/2.007 and
˚ respectively, in the Cu–Ntriaz /Cu–Nimin notation)
1.969/2.019 A,
explain wider angles between triazole planes (110.64◦ and 110.89◦ ,

respectively, thus closer to planarity). Complexes of a related
macrocycle with a longer aliphatic backbone (butylene fragments instead of propylene), [Co2 (L197)(H2 O)3 (MeCN)](ClO4 )2 ,
[Co2 (L197)(NCO)2 ] and [Co2 (L197)Cl2 ] [66], exhibit Co–N distances
very similar to these in the [Co(II)2 ] complex but a larger dihedral
angle between triazole rings because of the larger ﬂexibility of the
cyclic ligand. The ligand H2 L198 is even larger than the two macrocycles discussed, thus furnishing a ﬂat structure with Mn(II) in form
of the complex [Mn2 (L198)(H2 O)4 )]Cl2 [67].
A large group of dinuclear complexes exhibiting the double
␮1,2 -azoles has been described using symmetrically di-substituted
1,2,4-triazole rings, where the substituents are coordinating (a
very complete review on the complexes made of this type of
ligands is available) [68]. These multi-donors are suited to act
as ditopic ligands, by both chelating and bridging two metals.
These ligands, however, do not limit the degrees of freedom of
the ﬁnal assembly as do the macrocyclic donors discussed above.
Usually, two di-substituted rings locate in front of each other,
“sandwiching” two metals in between them, with the metals and
the triazole rings sharing approximately the same plane, while
additional monodentate donors occupy axial positions. The most
numerous group is formed by complexes of 3,5-bis-(pyridin-2-yl)1,2,4-triazole (HL75) or very close derivatives, incorporating Fe (see
Section 4), Mn [69], Ni [70,71], Co [72] and Cu [73] as metals. Examples with the parent ligand HL75 are [Mn2 (L75)2 Cl2 (H2 O)2 ] [69],
[Mn2 (L75)2 (NCS)2 (H2 O)2 ] [69] and [Ni2 (L75)2 (NCS)2 (H2 O)2 ] [71].
Interestingly, this ligand is not used as a reagent in the synthesis of
any of the three complexes but is formed in situ from solvothermal
reactions. In the case of the manganese complexes, the reaction sys-

tems are made originally of 2-cyanopyridine and hydrazine in EtOH
in the presence of MnCl2 , or formed by 2-pyridylamidrazone (2-pa)
together with Mn(SO4 )2 and KSCN in ethanol. The latter reaction
was in fact conducted to proof that 2-pa is a key intermediate in
the formation of the ligand HL75 from the corresponding organonitrile and hydrazine. Interestingly, [Mn2 (L75)2 Cl2 (H2 O)2 ] is present
in the crystal as two topological isomers (Fig. 26) that vary in the
positions of the Cl− and H2 O ligands on the complexes. Both Mn
complexes of HL75 exhibit severely distorted six-coordinate metal
centers.
The complex of Ni(II) is formed after the de-amination of the
ligand 4-amino-3,5-bis-(pyridin-2-yl)-1,2,4-triazole (L199) during
its reaction with NiCl2 and KSCN in solvothermal conditions

[71]. Susceptibility measurements on [Ni2 (L75)2 (NCS)2 (H2 O)2 ]
revealed, as expected, an antiferromagnetic coupling of the two
metals through the [N–N] bridges of J = −17.62 cm−1 . It is interesting to note that the ﬁrst example of this family of dinuclear
complexes characterized structurally, [Ni2 (L199)2 Cl2 (H2 O)2 ]Cl2
[72], was made with the amino derivative L199 and reported in
1984. In that report, evidence was provided for the preparation of
the Co(II) analogue. The magnetic coupling within the Ni(II) complex was estimated to be J = −12.5 cm−1 . Many other complexes of
this type have been characterized using related ligands with other
substituents on the position “4” of the tetrazole. These substituents
are isobutyl, pyrrol-1-yl or para-methoxyphenyl. Especially interesting is the series of compounds with the pyrrolyl substituted

depends on small variables such as solvents, anions, or solubility
differences. The following dinuclear systems have been characterized structurally [74,75]; [Co2 (L200)2 (H2 O)2 (DMF)2 ](ClO4 )4 ,

The structures of these complexes are very similar among them
and consist again of two ligands positioned in front of each other,
chelating the two metals sitting in between them. This fragment
lies approximately within one plane, except for the pyrrolyl

substituents, which are positioned perpendicularly. In all cases,
coordination number six around the metallic ions is completed by
solvent ligands (Fig. 27).
As expected, weak antiferromagnetic interactions between
the metals are observed within all the complexes, with J val-

ues ranging from −0.44 to −7.8 cm−1 . The complexes made with
ligands with other substituents on the position “4” of the triazole rings share a very similar structure to that in Fig. 26,
and show antiferromagnetic interactions of the same magnitude, except for the complex [Cu2 (L201)2 (ClO4 )2 (MeCN)2 ](ClO4 )2
[76], where the magnetic exchange is signiﬁcantly stronger
(J = −105 cm−1 ). The magnetic properties of the L200 analogue [Cu2 (L200)2 (H2 O)2 (MeCN)2 ](ClO4 )4 [74] were not reported.
Related ligands exhibit other coordinating groups on the “3” and
“5” positions of the 1,2,4-triazole ring, such as amino or diacetylamino groups, and yield the corresponding dinuclear systems,
namely [Cu(L202)(H2 O)2 ]2 [77], [Cu2 (L202)2 Br2 (H2 O)2 ]Br2 [78]
and [Cu(L203)(NO3 )(H2 O)]2 (this complex prepared along with the
Co and Ni analogues) [79].
The last group of dinuclear complexes with only the
[M–(N–N)2 –M] bridging fragment is made with tri- or tetra-

499

zole rings exhibiting only one coordinating substituent or none.
In these complexes, the number of degrees of freedom is even
larger than for the dinucleating ligands discussed just above; thus,
the ensemble of the two metals and the ﬁve membered heterocycles are also disposed approximately on one plane. Most
triazole ligands with one coordinating substituent are derivatives of 3-(pyridine-2-yl)-1,2,4-triazole (HL69). The complexes
with the parent ligand [Cu2 (L69)2 (mim)2 (NO3 )2 (H2 O)2 ] (mim = Nmethylimidazole) [80], [Cu2 (L69)2 (H2 O)3 (SO4 )] [81] (Fig. 28) and
[Ni2 (HL69)2 (H2 O)4 ](NO3 )4 [82] have been crystallographically
characterized. The second copper complex is one of the (surprisingly) very few cases in this family exhibiting square pyramidal
Cu(II) ions (Fig. 28).
In addition, this complex features an interesting monocoordinated SO4 − ligand on an equatorial site. It was found that for
the case of Cu(II), the intramolecular magnetic coupling between

metals is signiﬁcantly reduced in dinuclear systems with monosubstituted ligands with respect to the group of compounds reviewed
above, involving disubstituted triazole rings. For example, the coupling featured by the complex [Cu2 (L69)2 (mim)2 (NO3 )2 (H2 O)2 ] is
J = −47 cm−1 [80]. This has been attributed to a signiﬁcant distortion to the symmetry of the [M–(N–N)2 –M] core resulting
from the fact that each bridging ligand only chelates one of the
metals, instead of both [80]. The nickel complex also exhibits
antiferromagnetic interactions. A pioneering study of the dependence of the magnetic properties with external pressure was
carried out on this complex, showing that the strength of the
coupling increases with pressure until the latter reaches 8 Kbar,
where it starts to decrease again [82]. Other 2-pyridyl substituted ligands are L204, L205 and L206, which have lead to the
related complexes [Cu2 (L204)Cl4 ] [83], [Cu2 Cl4 (L205)2 ] [83], and
[Cu2 (L206)2 Cl4 ] [84]. Some tetrazole ligands also exhibit one coordinating substituent, thereby exhibiting the capacity of bridging
two metals while chelating one of them. Two of the resulting dinuclear complexes are [Cu2 (HL163)2 (N3 )2 (bpy)2 ] [85] and
[Ni2 (L52)2 (NH3 )6 ] [86]. The latter has been prepared in the context of an investigation of the coordination chemistry of a relatively
unexplored family of ligands; organic nitramines, called by the
authors “energetic” because of their capacity to undergo exothermic, autocatalytic thermal decomposition. Dinuclear complexes
with a planar [M–(N–N)2 –M] core may be formed with bridging
tri- or tetrazole ligands with no additional coordinating groups.
Examples of these are [Cu2 (L116)4 (bpy)2 ] [87], [Co2 (L32)2 Cl4 ]
[88], [Cu2 (L38)4 ](ClO4 )2 [89] or [Cu2 (L21)2 (ox)2 (H2 O)4 ] [90].
Particularly interesting is the series of dinuclear lanthanide
complexes [Yb2 (Cp)4 (L116)2 ] (Fig. 29), [Dy2 (Cp)4 (L116)2 ] and
[Gd2 (Cp)4 (L116)2 ] [91].
The three complexes feature two Ln(III) ions linked by two tetrazolate ligands in the very rare ␮:␩2 :␩1 coordination mode. This

binding mode is presumably facilitated by the fact that lanthanides
establish longer bonds and larger coordination numbers than 3d
metals. In addition to three nitrogen atoms from tetrazole, each
metal binds to two ␩5 -methyl-cyclopentadienil ligands.
3.1.3. Dinuclear complexes with single [–N–N–] bridge
We have found two examples of dinuclear complexes exhibiting
only one [–N–N–] bridge from tri- or tetrazole, and supported by
other bridging ligands. One is [Cu2 (L199)(SO4 )2 (H2 O)4 ] [92], which
is formed by the dinucleating ligand L199, with the metals further bridged by an SO4 2− group, both ligands occupying equatorial
positions. The other equatorial sites of the metals are ﬁlled by monodentate SO4 2− and H2 O, respectively, while H2 O molecules occupy
the axial sites to complete six and ﬁve coordination geometries,
respectively. The other complex is [Ni2 (L)2 (L103)](BPh3 )[93] –and
related derivatives–, where tetrazole completes a double thiophenolate bridge provided by a large macrocyclic ligand, L.
3.1.4. Dinuclear complexes with other bridges
Some dinuclear complexes involving tri- or tetrazoles exhibit
other bridges than the ubiquitous N–N bridge. The most numerous type is that of complexes of two Cu(II) ions linked by two
␮-Cl− ligands, with 1,2,3-triazole ligands attached to metals in
a monodentate fashion [54,94,95] (for example [Cu2 (HL3)4 Cl4 ])
[96]. One exception is [Mn2 (L206)2 (H2 O)2 Cl4 ]) [97], which
features Mn(II) as metal. In these complexes, the triazole ligands are not conditioning the nuclearity of the complex, and
their position could be occupied by any other terminal ligand (there are hundreds of [M(II)2 ] complexes bridged by
two Cl− ions reported in the literature). This is also the case
of other complexes with (end-to-end) ␮-SCN− bridges[98,99]
(e.g. [Cu2 (NCS)4 (L207)4 ]) [100] O2− units [Fe2 OCl2 (L208)4 ](PF6 )2 )
[101], OH− groups (e.g. [Yb2 (OH)2 (L159)4 (H2 O)4 ]) [102], and

502

G. Aromí et al. / Coordination Chemistry Reviews 255 (2011) 485–546

alkoxide[103] or phenoxide bridges (e.g. [Cu2 (L102)2 (MeOH)2 ])
[104].
Only one structure of a dinuclear complex has been
found with a 1,2,3-triazole, exhibiting a [–N–N–N–] bridge, i.e.
[Cu2 (tmbma)2 (L3)](NO3 )3 (tmbma = tris-(N-methylbenzimidazol2-ylmethyl)amine [105]. In this complex, the link between both
metals seems only supported by the triazole ring; however, the
multicyclic ligands also forming part of the complex reinforce the
bridge through the establishment of intramolecular ␲–␲ interactions (Fig. 30).
In the complex [Ni2 (L209)(en)4 ](ClO4 )3 (en = ethylenediamine)
[106], a [–N–C–N–] bridge (typical of imidazolate ligands) is
observed contributing to the bridging of two Ni(II) ions, which are
kept together with the help of other donors included in the ligand
HL209. A few other complexes exhibit two metals in the molecule,
well separated by multi-topic ligands containing tetrazole and
other donors. A good example is the family of the ligands represented by [Mn2 (L210)2 (hfac)4 ] (hfacH = hexaﬂuoroacetylacetone),

also prepared with Co, Ni and Cu (Fig. 31) [107]. The ligand L210 is
a triazole ring attached to an N-aminoxylphenyl radical. The radical center of each ligand is directly attached to one metal of the
complex, with which it establishes a very strong antiferromagnetic
interaction. This leads to two non-zero spin fragments that interact
weakly with each other through the conjugated ␲ system by means
of a spin polarization mechanism.
3.2. Trinuclear complexes
As mentioned above, molecules containing three metals constitute the second largest group of discrete complexes in this review.
These group into three structural types; (i) linear chains with triple
␮1,2 -bridges (from tri- or tetrazole), (ii) linear molecules exhibiting
a double ␮1,2 -bridge and a monodentate bridging ligand between
metals, (iii) hydroxo centered triangular complexes. Many of these
were reviewed about ten years ago[6] for the case of 1,2,4-triazoles
(to which correspond 95% of the examples).

3.2.1. Linear trinuclear complexes with triple [–N–N–] ( 1,2 )
bridges
There is a large list of crystallographically characterized complexes that contain the same linear trinuclear fragment as in the
complex [Ni3 (HL21)6 (H2 O)6 ](NO3 )6 (Fig. 32) [108], involving the
metals Cu, Co, Mn and Fe, in addition to Ni (the most frequent).
Complex [Ni3 (HL21)6 (H2 O)6 ](NO3 )6 was the ﬁrst reported of
any of the complexes reviewed in this manuscript and also, the
simplest of the trinuclear chains of the type discussed in the current section. Its structural description will serve to characterize
most aspects of the rest of the members of this family. This complex exhibits three octahedrally coordinated Ni(II) ions disposed
along a perfect straight line (Ni–Ni–Ni angle of 180.0◦ ), with pairs
of adjacent metals linked by three 1,2,4-triazole rings through their
[–N–N–] moiety. Within each pair, the three ligands are disposed
in mutual angles of 120◦ in form of a paddlewheel, reproduc-

ing the topology of the [M–(N–N)3 –M] fragments featured by the
related type of dinuclear complexes (see above and Fig. 22). Both
paddlewheels present in the [Ni3 ] complex are disposed in a staggered conformation, as required for steric reasons (see Fig. 32,
right), which suits perfectly the octahedral geometry of the central metal in this assembly type. The external three coordination
sites of each peripheral metal are occupied by molecules of water.
The complex unit exhibits a total of six positive charges that are
compensated by NO3 − anions distributed within the lattice, primarily in between the sheets formed by the complexes. Each triad
of ligands keeps the metals 3.737 A˚ apart, the distance between
˚
external Ni centers being thus exactly twice as long, i.e. 7.474 A.
At least seven other [Ni(II)3 ] complexes with the same central core
have been crystallographically characterized and reported since the
ﬁrst example was made. The differences between the various complexes lie mainly in the nature of the various substituents of the
1,2,4-triazole ligand, either on the ‘4N’ position (for example, in the

complex [Ni3 (HL72)6 (H2 O)6 ](BF4 )6 ) [109], on the sites ‘3,5’ of the
ring (like in the compound [Ni3 (HL22)6 (H2 O)6 ](SO4 )3 ) [62], or both
(see for example [Ni3 (L32)6 (H2 O)6 ]Cl6 ) [110]. If the counter ions
are coordinating, these might be found occupying external positions on the end metals instead of being in the crystal lattice (e.g.
[Ni3 (HL30)6 (NCS)6 ]) [111]. The reasons governing whether a trinuclear or the related dinuclear complex (see above) is the species
isolated from a given reaction might have to do primarily with solubility issues. Interestingly, the nuclearity of three seems to be the
upper limit in length for this category of discrete chains. The magnetic behaviour of some of the reported [Ni(II)3 ] complexes has
been investigated [110,111]. In all cases, weak antiferromagnetic
interactions between adjacent Ni ions have been determined, with
coupling constants J ranging from −7.9 cm−1 to −23 cm−1 . The differences have not been discussed in depth, although it is clear that
the electronic properties of the groups attached to the triazole rings
inﬂuence the extent of the coupling, presumably through modiﬁcation of the energy of the orbitals that interact with the magnetic
orbitals of the metals. An exceptional complex, related to this family of trinuclear compounds is [Ni3 (L3)6 (NH3 )6 ] [112], where the
bridging ligands are 1,2,3-benzotriazolate groups in the ␮1,2 coordination mode (Fig. 33).
From the above description, it is clear that it will be possible
to reach this architecture with any of the metals usually found in
octahedral geometry (at least divalent). Complexes made of cobalt
are especially frequent. A review from 2003 was devoted, in part,
to summarize the synthesis, structure and magnetic properties
of these and their related dinuclear analogues [60]. The earliest reported example was [Co3 (L35)8 (NCS)4 ](SCN)2 [113], which
was also the ﬁrst trinuclear Co(II) complex to be analyzed for its
magnetic properties. Given the strong inﬂuence of the spin–orbit
coupling in this ion, only the low temperature region (<40 K)
of the variable temperature susceptibility curve was simulated,
by considering isotropic metal ions with only the lowest S = 1/2
Kramers’ doublets populated. This model provided a coupling constant of J = −9.0 cm−1 and a large g value as a consequence of the
anisotropy of the metals, otherwise not included in the model
(g = 4.5). Similar values have been found for related [Co(II)3 ] complexes when using this magnetic model [114]. More recently, the
bulk magnetization of the analogue [Co3 (L63)6 (H2 O)6 ](NO3 )6 [115]
was modeled for a larger temperature range (2–250 K) using an
isotropic model where the Co(II) centers were considered to carry

S = 3/2 spin magnetic moments. This ﬁt provided the parameters J = −10.54 cm−1 and g = 2.02. A quite peculiar cobalt complex
of this family involves metals in two different oxidation states.
Thus, the metal centers in [Co3 (L30)4 (HL30)2 (H2 O)6 ]Cl3 [116] were
identiﬁed as Co(III) (central position) and Co(II) (at both ends).
This could be corroborated crystallographically (with the bond
distances to Co(III) ≈5 % shorter than for the more reduced centers), by means of UV–vis and EPR spectroscopy and through
bulk magnetization measurements. The ﬁrst related trinuclear
complex made of Mn, [Mn3 (L193)9 (H2 O)3 ](Tf)6 (HTf = triﬂic acid)
[117], which exhibits an almost negligible magnetic interaction
between adjacent metals (J = −0.6 cm−1 ), was modelled using both,
variable temperature magnetic susceptibility and isothermal magnetization measurements. Interestingly, the analogous complex
[Mn3 (HL72)6 (H2 O)6 ](ClO4 )6 , reported much more recently, displays almost exactly the same (lack of) intensity of magnetic
exchange (J = −0.65 cm−1 ) [109]. The few trinuclear complexes of
the kind discussed here featuring copper as metal show quite a
high degree of versatility. The complex [Cu3 (L63)8 (H2 O)4 ](NO3 )6
[118] contains Cu(II) ions exhibiting the rarely found compressed
Jahn–Teller distortion. Thus the axial (compressed) bond dis˚ whereas the (long)
tances to Cu(II) range from 1.973 to 2.030 A,
equatorial distances span the 2.178–2.195 A˚ range. Surprisingly,
the almost exact same complex [Cu3 (L63)10 (H2 O)2 ](ClO4 )6 [119]
exhibits Jahn–Teller elongated Cu(II) ions (with ranges from 1.995
to 2.043 A˚ and 2.275 to 2.535 A˚ for equatorial and axially elongated
bonds, respectively). It is interesting to note that these two complexes share the same core. The only differences are the nature of
the (non coordinated) counter anions and one terminal ligand on
each metal (terminal triazole versus water). It might be expected
that, these disparate types of Jahn–Teller distortion lead to differences on the magnetic exchange between metals, since the shape
and orientation of the magnetic orbitals differ completely from one
geometry to the other. This is indeed the case, with J values of
−23.6 and −5.41 cm−1 for the ﬁrst and second complex, respectively. A mixed valence trinuclear complex with copper has also
been reported; [Cu3 (L32)6 (NCS)2 ](ClO4 )2 (Fig. 34) [120]. The core
of this complex is the same as all the linear [M3 ] chains described
above, with the difference that the end metals (CuI ) only feature one
terminal ligand, thus exhibiting tetrahedral coordination geometry.
The above complex is prepared using exactly the same procedure that leads to a [Cu(II)3 ] complex of the same ligand with a
triangular structure. Paradoxically, the method for obtaining either

one or the other was not explained by the authors of the manuscript
where these compounds were reported [120]. There are also a few
complexes with the chain trinuclear structure made of iron(II). One
example is [Fe3 (L211)6 (H2 O)6 ](Tos)6 (HTos = paratoluensulfonic
acid), which was reported together with its BF4 − analogue [121].
The latter exhibits three high-spin Fe(II) centers in the whole
range of temperatures examined (2–335 K), with antiferromagnetic coupling between the central ion and the external centers
(J = −11.4 cm−1 ). Interestingly, changing just the (non coordinated)
counter ion from BF4 − to Tos− causes the central ion to undergo
thermal spin transition. This remarkable effect is attributed to the
change in the dihedral angle between the aromatic cycles of the
ligand L211, which has an electronic inﬂuence on the coordination
environment around the Fe(II) ions, so as to change the spin state
of the central metal. Other related [Fe(II)3 ] complexes show also
spin transition and are discussed more in detail in Section 4 of this
review.
3.2.2. Linear trinuclear complexes with double [–N–N–] and a
mono-atomic bridge
There is another well established family of complexes formed
by three metals disposed linearly, bridged pairwise by only two
1,2,4-triazole rings in the ␮1,2 -mode, together with one bridging
atom from another ligand (F− , Cl− , NCS− , and OH− ). Of these, the
complexes of Cu(II) constitute a representative group. Within that
group, it has been observed that the intramolecular Cu···Cu coupling falls within two categories independently of the nature of the
third bridging ligand; (i) couplings with J values near −37 cm−1 ,
where both triazole bridges lie on equatorial positions of adjacent
Cu(II) ions, such as in the complex [Cu3 (HL30)4 (Cl)2 (H2 O)4 (SO4 )2 ]
(Fig. 35) [61], and (ii) couplings of approximately J = −17 cm−1 , with
one of the bridging triazole ligands binding to the apical site of one
of the Cu(II) ions, like in [Cu3 (H2 L212)6 Cl4 ]Cl2 (Fig. 36, left) [122].

not shown for clarity. (right) Scheme of the overlap between the ␴ orbitals of 1,2,4-triazole ligands and the magnetic orbital (dx2 −y2 ) of Cu(II) when the former occupy all
metal equatorial positions and when there is a bond to one metal apical position.

In complexes of the ﬁrst kind, the magnetic orbitals of the metal
ions (dx2 −y2 ) overlap directly with the ␴ orbitals of the triazole
ligands that participate of the bond (see Fig. 36, right), thus allowing for a strong antiferromagnetic coupling [61,123]. If one of the
Cu–N bonds to the bridging triazoles occurs on the metal’s axial
position, one of the coupling pathways is practically interrupted,
since in that case the magnetic (dx2 −y2 ) orbital of that metal is
oriented perpendicularly to that bond, and therefore does not overlap with the ligand’s ␴ orbital (Fig. 36, right). The consequence is
that the strength of the coupling is reduced signiﬁcantly. There
are also interesting complexes of this type involving other metals. The synthesis of [Co3 (HL23)6 (NCS)4 F2 ] [124], with F− bridging
ions, was preceded by the preparation of a very related complex
[Co3 (HL21)6 (NCS)6 ] (not crystallographically characterized) [125],
with SCN− groups instead of F− ions. The main synthetic difference was the addition of CoF2 to the reaction system as part of the
metal source, in the preparation of the ﬂuoride analogue. Comparison between both compounds allowed establishing that the ␮-F−
bridge facilitates stronger antiferromagnetic interactions than the
␮-NCS− pathway. The same trend was observed on the analogous pair of compounds with Ni(II), [Ni3 (HL23)6 (NCS)6 (H2 O)] [125]
and [Ni3 (HL23)6 (NCS)4 F2 ] (not crystallographically characterized)
[125]. In this case, the modelling of the magnetic behaviour was
more accurate than for the cobalt systems, since Ni(II) is not subject to the complicating effects of spin–orbit coupling, present
in octahedral Co(II) ions. The trends observed with Ni(II) were
much more pronounced; in the all SCN− complex, a ferromagnetic
Ni···Ni exchange coupling constant was observed (J = +9.6 cm−1 ),
whereas for the ﬂuoride-bridged system, an antiferromagnetic
interaction was determined (J = −11.1 cm−1 ). This was ascribed
to the sharper M–X–M angle in the former compound (105.5◦
versus an estimated value of 114.4◦ ), together with the fact that
more electronegative bridges tend to enhance the antiferromagnetic character of the coupling. The ferromagnetic character in
[Ni3 (HL23)6 (NCS)6 (H2 O)] could be corroborated with a very similar derivative, [Ni3 (L32)6 (NCS)6 ] [126], reported several years later
(J = + 10.45 cm−1 ).
3.2.3. Trinuclear complexes with a triangular geometry
The triangular complexes identiﬁed, relevant to this review, are
of two types. The ﬁrst is a series of hydroxide centered [Cu(II)3 ]
complexes, always involving 1,2,4-triazole bridging ligands. Most
of them exhibit octahedral or square pyramidal Cu(II) ions bridged
pairwise through ␮1,2 -triazole groups, which bind to the metals on
equatorial sites. The other two equatorial sites are occupied by the
central ␮3 -OH− and by, either a terminal ligand or by another donor
atom from the triazole ligand. A long list of compounds belong
to the latter category, for example [Cu3 (L213)3 (OH)(H2 O)2 ](NO3 )2

[127], [Cu3 (OH)(HL214)3 A(H2 O)2 ]A (A− = CF3 SO3 − , NO3 − , ClO4 − ;
Fig. 37)[128] and [Cu3 (OH)(HL215)3 (H2 O)3 ](NO3 )2 [129].
Solvent molecules or anions usually occupy one or two axial
positions of the metals. Originally, the ligand HL214 had only
produced mononuclear systems, in form of the bis-chelate. The
key to synthesize the triangular system was the ability of this
ligand to lose a proton and thus acquire the capacity to bind additional metals. These complexes constitute appropriate systems to
investigate the magnetic phenomenon of geometrical spin frustration, since the Cu(II) ions are coupled antiferromagnetically. The
magnetic properties of complex [Cu3 (OH)(HL215)3 (H2 O)3 ](NO3 )2
[129] were investigated in detail, and the data were modeled
by introducing a term for the antisymmetric exchange to the
spin Hamiltonian. The low temperature data, however could
only by reproduced correctly by considering two different (and
strongly antiferromagnetic) exchange constants within the triangle, and thus the lack of perfect trigonal symmetry. Values of
J = −156.4 to −191.0 cm−1 were obtained. The triangular complex
[Cu3 (OH)(L33)2 (piv)5 (H2 O)] (Fig. 38)[130] is a singularity within
this group of compounds. It is made from the corresponding triazole and the pivalate salt of Cu(II). This counter-ion is a much
better ligand than the other ions employed as part of the metal
salts; therefore, it has a drastic impact on the structure by acting as
one of the bridging ligands between the Cu(II) ions, or by displacing
one of the triazole groups from equatorial to axial positions.
The result is a highly asymmetric structure, where each copper
ion displays a distinct coordination environment. In line with this

structure, three different coupling constants were determined from
modeling the variable-temperature bulk magnetization. The value
involving [–N–N–] bridges via equatorial positions (J = −55.6 cm−1 )
is lower than the values observed for this pathway on the regular
triangles. The reason is perhaps the highly distorted coordination
geometries observed in this complex. The second type of triangular systems is a group of related [Fe(III)2 M(II)] (M = Fe, Co, Ni, Cu)
complexes with formula [Fe2 MO(L216)2 ] [131]. These heterovalent complexes are held together by the chelating and bridging
capacity of three L2162− ligands, each consisting of a central 2,6diamidopyridine moiety and two external tetrazole groups. Thus,
each metal is coordinated by the three atoms of the central pocket
of one ligand and linked to the other two metals through two Natoms of the tetrazole rings of that same ligand. As a result, each
pair of metals exhibits a double [–N–C–N–] bridge. In addition, the
metals are bridged by a central ␮3 -O2− group (Fig. 39).
The core of these complexes is equivalent to that of
the well-known [M3 O(O2 CR)6 L3 ] basic carboxylate complexes
(S = monodentate ligands, usually from solvents) [132], with the

advantage that all the peripheral bridging ligands bind now the
three metals via ﬁve coordination bonds, the resulting structure
being therefore much more robust. This has allowed for a very
complete characterization of these complexes, especially in solution. One of the issues that have been evaluated in this manner
is the important question of electron transfer. For example, in
the all-iron complex, it has been established that the complex
remains in a “partially valence-trapped” state up to room temperature. Another triangular complex related to both groups just
described is (NHEt3 )2 [Mn3 O(L3)6 F3 ] [133]. It belongs to a series of
high-nuclearity Mn(III) complexes made using MnF3 as a source
of this metal ion (see below). The complex anion contains an
oxo-centered triangle of Mn(III) centers linked pairwise by double [–N–N–] bridges from L3− . The distorted, Jahn–Teller elongated
coordination geometry is completed by one terminal F− ligand on
each metal (occupying equatorial positions).
3.3. Tetranuclear complexes
A structural search reveals a group of several complexes made
of tri- or tetrazoles containing four metal atoms. These molecules
occur mainly in form of tetrahedral, rectangular or “butterﬂy”-like
topologies, in addition to other shapes, occasionally.

dark grey is O, medium grey is C and light grey is N. Hydrogen atoms not shown for
clarity.

3.3.1. Tetrahedral complexes
Tetrahedral Cu(II) complexes with a central ␮4 -O2− ligand are
extremely commonplace in the literature. Of these, the majority feature a [Cu4 OX6 ] (X− = Cl− , Br− ) neutral core while the
trigonal–bipyramidal coordination geometry of each metal is completed with four terminal ligands on the axial positions. In relation
with this review are the examples where these terminal ligands are
monodentate 1,2,3-triazole molecules (such as in [Cu4 OCl6 (L4)4 ],
Fig. 40) [94], or a terminal tetrazole ([Cu4 OCl6 (L107)4 ] [134].
The structural role played by the heterocycles in this type of
complexes is clearly not very relevant. Beyond this group, one peculiar complex is [Cu(HL217)(H2 O)]4 (NO3 )4 (Fig. 41) [135], which
features the four metals at the vertices of an imaginary tetrahedron.
The formation of this complex was very surprising, since the
ligand HL217 (3-(pyridin-2-yl)-5-(pyrazin-2-yl)-1,2,4-triazole) is
very similar to the symmetric ligand 3,5-bis-(pyridin-2-yl)-1,2,4triazole (HL75), which generally leads to dinuclear Cu(II) complexes

with two ligands bridging, chelating and “sandwiching” the metals
(see above). In these adducts, the ligands occupy only the equatorial positions. By contrast, in the complex with HL217, the two
chelating rings on each metal are in cis position; thus, both ligands are mutually perpendicular, each binding to a different second
Cu(II) ion. In this manner, a cycle of four bridging ligands and four
metals is formed with the ligands disposed as two pairs; within
each pair, both are parallel and exhibit ␲–␲ stacking through one
of their pyridine moieties, whereas in between pairs, the ligands
are perpendicular to each other. A molecule of H2 O completes the
square-pyramidal geometry around each Cu(II) ion (binding on an
equatorial position). Preliminary investigations suggested antiferromagnetic interactions between the metals within the molecule.
3.3.2. Rectangular complexes
The few rectangular complexes reported are made of 1,2,4triazole ligands and can be regarded as dimers of [–N–N–]
bridged dinuclear units. In complexes [Mn4 (H3 bpa)2 (HL69)4 (N3 )2 ]
(Fig. 42)[69] and [Mn4 (H3 bpa)2 (HL218)4 (N3 )2 ] [69] these units feature two Mn(II) ions bridged by two pyridyl-1,2,4-triazole ligands,
which in turn are linked to each other by the polydentate ligand
N,N -bis(picolinamide)azine (H4 bpa), thereby conforming the rectangle [69].
All the ligands in these complexes are formed under
solvothermal conditions from 2-pyridyl amidrazone and either
manganese(II) formate or acetate in the presence of N3 − . These
studies helped to elucidate the mechanism of formation of pyridyl
substituted 1,2,4-triazoles from 2-cyanopyridine and hydrazine in
solvothermal conditions, either in the presence of metals or not.
Magnetic susceptibility measurements on these complexes underscores the fact that the coupling between Mn(II) ions through
␮1,2 -triazoles is much weaker (of the order of 1 cm−1 ) than for
most Cu(II) systems. Complexes [Cu4 (L75)4 (pic)2 ] (Hpic = picolinic
acid)[136] and [Cu4 (L75)4 ][137] can be regarded as two [Cu2 ] units
held together by one L75− ligand in the usual ␮1,2 manner, and
linked to each other by two additional L75− ligands chelating the
metals via their pyridine groups and ␮1,4 -triazole groups (thus
adopting a syn,anti conﬁguration with respect to the “N–N” moiety).
In complex [Cu4 (L75)4 (pic)2 ], two metals are in the oxidation state
+2 and the other two are monovalent. The octahedral coordination

clarity.

geometry around the Cu(II) ions and the charges of the complex
are completed through binding of one chelating picolinate ligand
to each of them. Complex [Cu4 (L75)4 ] is made of four Cu(I) ions;
thus, the four bridging and chelating L75− ligands sufﬁce to achieve
a (distorted) tetrahedral coordination geometry, as preferred by
this ion. Again, one of the important aspects in the formation of
these complexes is the method of preparation; in both cases, the
triazole is formed in situ, using 2-pyridylacetonitrile and ammonia
as precursors and solvothermal conditions. The rectangular complex [Cu4 (L30)4 (OH)2 (NO3 )(H2 O)6 ](NO3 ) [138] also exhibits two
types of Cu···Cu bridges; one involves only the [–N–N–] moiety of
a guanazole ligand (HL30), and the other one exhibits this motif
together with a ␮-OH− bridge, all these ligands always occupying equatorial positions. In this complex, three of the Cu(II) ions
are square-based pyramidal while the fourth one is square planar.
The remaining equatorial sites (one per metal) are ﬁlled by water
molecules, whereas the apical positions (three in total) are occupied
by two molecules of H2 O and one NO3 − ligand, respectively. The
nickel(II) complex [Ni4 (L199)2 (L199-H)(N3 )5 (AcO)2 ] (Fig. 43)[71]

are pointing towards the center of the complex and are bound to a
Cu(I) ion. A PPh3 ligand occupies the fourth coordination position
on this metal to complete a tetrahedral coordination environment.
The three peripheral Cu(I) ions are also bound to a PPh3 ligand each,
thereby reaching a coordination number of three. The shape of this
molecular ion was described as a “reverse umbrella”.
3.4. Pentanuclear complexes

exhibits an irregular rectangular structure. Two faces are virtually
identical and feature Ni···Ni pairs connected through two 4-amino3,5-bis(pyridin-2-yl)-1,2,4-triazole ligands in the ␮1,2 mode, which
also chelate the metals in the usual manner (see above).
The other two sides are unequal; one exhibits two end-on (EO)
␮-N3 − bridging ligands and one syn,syn bridging acetate, and the
other side features one acetate, one azide and the deprotonated
amine of one L199 ligand, which also coordinates with its pyridyl
groups to both metals, respectively. In ﬁtting the magnetic data,
these two sides were considered equal and were assigned weak
ferromagnetic coupling (J = 15.3 cm−1 ), while the other two sides
were attributed a coupling constant of J = −2.2 cm−1 .
3.3.3. Other tetranuclear topologies
Among the structural types involving four metal ions can be
found the so called “butterﬂy” arrangement. This organization
consists of two fused oxo- or hydroxo-centred triangles, usually
exhibiting additional bridging carboxylate ligands. The two central metal ions form the “body” of the butterﬂy and the remaining
two external metals constitute the wings. The complexes[130]
[Cu4 (OH)2 (L31)2 (piv)6 ] (Fig. 44), [Cu4 (OH)2 (L35)2 (piv)6 ] and
[Cu4 (OH)2 (L32)6 (piv)4 ]2+ belong to this category.
The latter is in fact a complex cation that co-crystallizes with
a dinuclear and dianionic complex. These three complexes exhibit
bridging pivalate ligands, in addition to ␮-triazolate ligands, which
are a unique occurrence among “butterﬂy” type complexes. Both
donors are also found as terminal ligands. The magnetic coupling
within the ﬁrst two complexes was very strongly antiferromagnetic (with J values in the −260 to −216 cm−1 range) and leading to
ground states of S = 0. Such coupling occurs via the OH− and triazolate bridges, linking the metals through equatorial positions (along
which, lie the magnetic orbitals dx2 −y2 ).
A rare combination of alkoxide, pyridyl and triazole donors on
one ligand affords the conditions for the assembly of a cubic complex, [Cu4 (L219)4 ](NO3 )4 [139], exhibiting the [Cu4 O4 ] core, which
otherwise is extremely common in coordination chemistry. In this
instance, the triazole cycle only acts as a terminal ligand, saturating one coordination site per metal. A very aesthetic cationic
complex, exhibiting a centered triangular structure and formula
[Cu4 (L3)3 (PPh3 )4 ]+ has been reported (Fig. 45) [140].
The core of this complex features a central ring with the
sequence (–Cu–N–N–N–)3 , the strings of three adjacent N-atoms
belonging to ␮1,2,3 -benzotriazole ligands. The mid N atoms of these

The complex [Cu5 (L)2 (L22)2 ](ClO4 )3 contains two dinuclear
units formed within a polyimine macrocyclic ligand (L) [141]. These
units are linked by two 1,2,4-triazole ligands, each bound to both
metals of one dinuclear [Cu(I)2 ] unit in the ␮1,2 -mode, and both
attached through the 4N position to a central Cu(I) ion acting as a
bridge. This complex and very close derivatives come about thanks
to the formation in situ of the triazole bridges by the oxidative coupling of aliphatic nitriles catalyzed by the presence of the [Cu2 ]
entities, with the concurrence of NH3 , presumably present after
hydrolysis of part of the corresponding organonitrile. Besides this
group of Cu aggregates, all the pentanuclear complexes in this
review are made of benzotriazole (or one very close derivative in
one instance) and exhibit a centered tetrahedral topology. With
one exception (see below), these are regular or only slightly distorted tetrahedra. The core shared by most of these complexes is in
Fig. 46, which shows six ␮3 -L3− ligands spanning the edges of the
tetrahedron.
The earliest example is the mixed-valence complex
[Cu5 (L3)6 (tbi)4 ] (tbi = t-butylisocyanide) [142] with a central Cu(II)
ion exhibiting unusual compressed Jahn–Teller distortion, and four
Cu(I) metals at the vertices of the tetrahedron. The latter are four
coordinated, their tetrahedral geometry being completed by an
isocyanide ligand bound through one C atom. The reaction involves
partial aerobic oxidation of Cu(I) to Cu(II) and it does not proceed in
the absence of air. Thus, Cu(II) is necessary for the formation of the
assembly; the reduced metal would not be capable of occupying
the central position, probably because of the crystal-ﬁeld energy
rather than for charge considerations. The tetrahedral structural
motif in Fig. 46 is also stable with other metals and other oxidation
states. For example, in complexes [Co5 (L3)6 (NO3 )4 (H2 O)4 ] and
[Ni5 (L3)6 (NO3 )4 (H2 O)4 ] [143] the metals are all in the oxidation
state +2. Coordination number six around the external M(II) ions
is, in both cases completed with one bidentate NO3 − ligand and
one H2 O molecule per metal. The low coordinating ability of
nitrate was exploited for the preparation of functional networks
of the [M5 ] complexes by replacement of this ligand with bridging
TCNQ·− radicals (TCNQ = 7,7,8,8-tetracyano-p-quinodimethane),
yielding 3D polymers with formula [M5 (L3)6 (TCNQ)4 (H2 O)4 ]n
[143]. Other complexes of this category are [Cu5 (L3)6 (acac)4 ]
(Hacac = acetylacetone)
[144],
[Cu5 (L3)6 (Hbtfam)4 ]
(Hbtfam = benzoyltriﬂuoroacetylmethane)[145] and [Cu5 (L3)6 (trop)4 ]
(Htrop = tropolone) [145]. These three complexes are made of
all Cu(II) and only differ on the nature of the chelating ligand
that serves to complete the coordination number ﬁve around
each metal. Several other derivatives have been made and
characterized unambiguously, just by changing the terminal
chelating ligands, without need of determining the molecular structure [145]. Interestingly, the central Cu(II) ion in
these complexes, contrary to the mixed-valence complex (see
above), exhibits Jahn–Teller elongation instead of compression.
The overall magnetic coupling within the [CuII 5 ] complexes
was antiferromagnetic. Models discriminating between the
central–apical interaction and the apex–apex exchange have
been used to ﬁt the data. The result is that the coupling is weak
(with J values ranging from −6.5 to −10 cm−1 ). Another group
of related complexes are [Ni5 (L3)5 (acac)4 (OH)(H2 O)4 ] [146],
[Ni5 (L220)5 (acac)4 (OH)(H2 O)4 ] [147] and [Cu5 (L3)5 Cl(PPh3 )4 ]

[148]. In these complexes, one of the sides of the tetrahedron is
occupied by a monoatomic bridge (OH− or Cl− ) instead of triazole.
In the case of the Ni(II) complexes, this bridge originates from
deprotonation of H2 O molecules by part of the acac− ligands used
in the reaction, whereas for the copper complex, the authors of its
preparation are not very clear about the origin of the Cl− ligand,
since the only source of this element in the reaction appears to be
ClO4 − . In any case, the formation of the asymmetric complexes
could reﬂect the relaxation of structural strains present on the
regular complexes, or an energy gain resulting from the bonds
formed by the new bridging ligands.
The complex [Fe5 O2 (OMe)2 Cl5 (L3)4 (HL3)(MeOH)5 ] [149] is
related to the family of pentanuclear compounds of this section,
with signiﬁcant differences. It consists of a centered tetrahedron,
elongated by the insertion of a ␮3 -O2− ligand between the central metal and each of both pairs of apical Fe centers (Fig. 47).
Besides these bridges, there is one ␮1,2 -L3− connection between
the central metal ion and each of the other metals, which completes
the octahedral environment around the former. The pairs of metals on each side of the elongated tetrahedron are linked through
their respective ␮3 -O2− ligands and one ␮-OMe− group. Five- or
six coordination numbers around these metals are completed by
terminal Cl− , MeOH or HL3 ligands. The magnetic coupling within

balls are metal ions, medium grey is C and light grey is N. Hydrogen atoms not shown
for clarity.

this complex is dominated by the oxygen, monoatomic bridges. The
central-apical interaction, occurring through wide Fe–O–Fe angles
(near 129◦ ) is reﬂected by an antiferromagnetic coupling constant
of J1 = −7.3 cm−1 , while the apical pairs of metals, mediated by
bridges with small Fe–O–Fe angles (<102◦ ) exhibit ferromagnetic
coupling, with J2 = + 8.6 cm−1 . This yields a high-spin ground state
of S = 15/2.
3.5. Higher nuclearities
3.5.1. Complexes with six to nine metals
The compound [Cu6 Cl10 (OH)2 (HL73)6 (H2 O)3 ] [150] is the only
molecular complex with six metals found in the context of this
compendium. Its molecular structure (Fig. 48) shows two hydroxocentered triangles of distorted octahedral Cu(II) ions of the kind
described above, linked by a ␮6 -Cl− ligand bound on axial positions
of all the metals. Triazole ligands span each side of the triangles,
bridging pairs of metals via the –N–N– fragment. The equatorial
sites of the Cu(II) ions are occupied by terminal chloride ligands,
whereas the six available axial positions are ﬁlled by three Cl−
ions and three H2 O molecules distributed statistically. The study
of the magnetic properties in this complex reveals moderate antiferromagnetic interactions (J = −17.1 cm−1 ) along the edges of the
triangles (through ␮1,2 -triazoles) and weak interactions between
both triangles (zJ = −2.3 cm−1 ). This ﬁt did not involve the inclusion
of antisymmetric exchange terms to the Hamiltonian.
The nuclearity of seven is also represented only by one
compound; [Ni7 (OH)2 (acac)8 (L221)4 (H2 O)2 ] [151]. This complex
exhibits seven Ni(II) ions in form of a pentanuclear “undulated”
string, linked laterally to two other metal ions (Fig. 49). There are
three types of bridging ligands cementing the heptanuclear structure; two ␮3 -OH− groups, four L221− ligands (two as ‘␮4 ’ and
two linking a pair of metals), and four acac− donors (two triply
bridging and two ␮-acac− moieties). In addition, there are four terminal (chelating) acac− ligands and two water molecules. Clearly,
the additional oxygen donor of the L221− ligand contributes to the
complexity and higher nuclearity of this complex, as compared to
the majority of complexes of 1,2,3-triazoles. A combination of ferroand antiferromagnetic interactions leads to a total spin ground state
of S = 1. The nature of the exchange interactions is justiﬁed in view
of magnetostructural correlations, which postulate that the coupling is expected to be ferromagnetic for acute Ni–O–Ni angles and
switch to antiferromagnetic for wider angles.
A beautiful representation of octanuclearity is the cage complex
(TBA)14 [Co8 (L222)12 ] (TBA+ = tetrabutylammonium, Fig. 50) [152].
The complex anion in this compound is a cubic arrangement of octahedral cobalt ions, each chelated by three ligands disposed along
perpendicular directions. There are two metals in the oxidation

state +2, while the remaining metals are Co(III). This is reﬂected on
a geometrical distortion of the cube and can be traced through magnetic susceptibility measurements. The other complexes with this
nuclearity are also remarkable; these are the analogous compounds
[V8 O4 (L3)8 (piv)4 Cl6 ] and [V8 O4 (L3)8 (BzO)4 Cl6 ] [153]. In fact, many
of these all V(III) molecules were prepared, under solvothermal
conditions, using various 1,2,3-triazole and carboxylate derivatives,
with [n Bu4 N]3 [V2 Cl9 ] as starting material. Their structures (Fig. 51)
feature one central oxo-bridged butterﬂy of four V(III) ions linked
on each side to a further pair of metals via a total of eight ␮3 -triazole
ligands. Each of the external V2 pairs exhibit two syn,syn carboxylate bridges. The strong ferromagnetic interactions exhibited by
some V(III) complexes motivated attempts to prepare SMMs of this
ion. In fact, the [V8 ] complexes exhibit S = 4 spin ground states,
and some of the ferromagnetic coupling constants encountered are
unusually strong (up to J = + 101 cm−1 ).
The complex [Ni9 (L223)8 (OH)6 (NH3 )4 (H2 O)8 ](NO3 )4 contains
nine Ni(II) ions held together in the molecule by the bridging action
of L223− , with the help of six O2− groups [154]. The complex
exhibits a central [Ni3 ] string as observed with the linear trinuclear
complexes with triple [–N–N–] bridges studied above. The additional donor atoms of the triazole rings allow for the growth of the
complex at both ends, which are both capped by three Ni(II) ions.
The ends of the complex thus constitute two open cubane units,
each involving three ␮-O2− groups and with one vacant apex, fused
with the central fragment.
3.5.2. Fluoride-bridged manganese complexes
A successful synthetic program focused on the use of F− ions
to foster the formation of novel high-nuclearity manganese aggregates. This was done in part in combination with benzotriazole as
bridging co-ligand. The ﬁrst complex made in this manner is the
spectacular molecule (and the largest of this review) with formula
[Mn26 O16 (OH)10 (OMe)6 F10 (L3)20 (HL3)2 (MeOH)13 (H2 O)] (Fig. 52)
[155]. It is prepared in low yield from the reaction of MnF3 and HL3
as a melt at 100 ◦ C (with no solvent), followed by extraction with
MeOH and diffusion of Et2 O. In fact, the F− ligands are only found
on terminal positions; therefore, they do not seem to be essential
for the stabilization of the structure of the [Mn26 ] complex. It has
not however, been prepared from any other starting material. The
complex structure relies on the cohesive function of sixteen triply
bridging oxide ligands and ten ␮- or ␮3 -OH− groups. In addition
there are L3− ligands bound in the ␮1,2 or ␮1,2,3 -modes. The magnetic coupling within this molecule appears to be dominated by

antiferromagnetic interactions. However, a combination of experiments leads to the conclusion that the spin ground state lies in
between S = 4 and 5. It was found that this complex behaves as a
Single Molecule Magnet (SMM), and it constitutes one of the very
few examples in this review presenting this behaviour.
The [Mn26 ] complex can be made in better yield from the same
reaction using MeOH directly as a solvent. If pyridine is added to the
reaction mixture, the new complex [Mn10 O6 (OH)2 (L3)8 (py)8 F8 ] is
formed instead (Fig. 53) [155]. This molecule exhibits an irregular supertetrahedral structure, centered on the edges. The core of
this structure contains six ␮3 -O2− and two ␮3 -OH− groups. The
three metals of each edge are either linked by two L3− bridges
or by one ␮-L3− and one ␮-F− ligand. The remaining coordination sites are occupied by terminal F− ions or pyridine ligands.
This compound exhibits a diamagnetic ground state. The nature
and strength of the magnetic coupling is hard to establish, presumably because there are a lot of closely spaced magnetic states.
The very same reaction scheme using HL220 in boiling MeOH
produced complexes [Mn13 O12 (L220)12 F6 (MeOH)10 (H2 O)2 ] [156]
and [Mn8 O4 (L220)6 (OMe)2 F8 (HL220)(MeOH)8 ] [156]. The former
(Fig. 54) consist of an oxido-bridged, centered hexagonal dish of
Mn(III) ions. Each pair on the periphery of this dish is bridged by
an O2− group, which links it to a further Mn(III) ion with the help
of two ␮1,2 -L220− ligands. Of the six external metal ions attached
in this manner to the central dish, three point above the plane of
the dish and three below. The F− ions occupy again terminal positions. The octanuclear complex (Fig. 55) also exhibits a succession
of fused, oxo-centered [Mn3 ] triangles. By contrast to the previous
complex, it shows bridging F− ligands, while it combines L220−

ligands acting in bridging and terminal modes. The only difference
in the synthesis of the [Mn13 ] and the [Mn8 ] complexes is that the
system was boiled for 20 min to prepare the former and only for
10 min to obtain the other complex. No magnetic studies have been
reported for any of these compounds.
3.5.3. A family of [M14 ] complexes
A family of remarkable [M14 ] complexes of various metals,
involving benzotriazole, has been synthesized using solvothermal techniques. The ﬁrst example was the all Fe(III) complex
[Fe14 (L3)6 O6 (OMe)18 Cl6 ] (Fig. 56) [157], prepared in superheated
MeOH (100 ◦ C) from the complex [Fe3 O(O2 CMe)6 (H2 O)3 ]Cl and
HL3.
This original molecule contains a central hexagonal bipyramid of
Fe(III) ions held together by six O2− and six OMe− ligands. The oxide
groups link this central cage to six additional metals (three above
and three below the hexagonal plane), thereby adopting the ␮4 -O2−
coordination mode. Additional OMe− groups also contribute to link
the peripheral metals to the central complex. Each triad of external
Fe(III) ions are ‘crowned’ by three bridging 1,2,3-triazole ligands,
which bind simultaneously to the metal conforming the apex of
the ‘ferric’ bipyramid. Preliminary magnetic studies revealed that
the spin ground state of this complex is near S = 25, with many
other spin states in the vicinity. These properties are not ideal
for SMMs but they render this complex a good candidate for
magnetic refrigeration [158]. The analogous complex with 1,2,3triazole (HL1), [Fe14 (L1)6 O6 (OMe)18 Cl6 ] has been prepared more

recently [159]. Since the HL1 ligand is smaller, the packing of this
complex is more compact. Antiferromagnetic ordering is observed
at low temperatures for both derivatives, although it is more
intense in the latter [Fe14 ] complex. Other 1,2,3-triazole ligands
also led to the same type of structure. In addition, the analogous
arrangement could be made for other metals. Thus, solvothermal
methods were used to isolate complexes [Cr14 (L3)6 O6 (OMe)18 Cl6 ]
and [V14 O6 (L220)6 (OMe)18 Cl6−x Ox ] [159]. In the vanadium complex, some VIII –Cl moieties had been replaced by VIV –O fragments,
presumably resulting from partial oxidation of the system during
the synthesis. The samples used analyzed for x = 2.
3.5.4. Other complexes with more than nine metals
Most of the complexes gathering more than nine metals in
their molecular structure ([Mn26 ], [Mn13 ], [Mn10 ], and [M14 ]) have
been grouped and featured already in previous sections. Another
related high-nuclearity complex is [(VO)8 V2 (L220)8 (OH)4 (OMe)10 ]
(Fig. 57) [160]. This molecule consists of a doubly ␮-MeO− bridged
dimer of V(III) ions, encapsulated by a tetragonal rectangular prism
of V O moieties. The eight (long) edges of the squares are spanned
by (␮1,3 or ␮1,2,3 ) 1,2,3-triazole ligands, while each of the short
edges are built by two ␮-MeO− groups and a ␮3 -O2− ligand (also

bound to a central vanadium ion). The overall magnetic coupling
within the complex is antiferromagnetic.
The
last
complex
in
this
section
is
[Ni13 (OH)6 (O2 CMe)8 (L221)12 (H2 O)6 (n PrOH)4 ] (Figs. 58 and 59)
[161]. This molecule comes about as a result of the capacity of the
L221− ligand to bind several metals in a variety of coordination
modes. In this complex, the twelve L221− ligands bind to three
metals, with both of their available N-donor atoms and the oxygen
atom attached to one metal each. The molecule consists of a
central [Ni3 ] moiety with triple [–N–N–] bridges, linked at each
end to a “star” of three Ni(II) ions by ␮3 -OH− groups and L221−
ligands. Each such “star” is further bridged to another nickel
center by three L221− ligands. The authors of this preparation
made react the [Ni13 ] complex in MeOH with an excess of N3 −
in order to replace by these ligands the ␮3 -OH− groups, as they
had done before with other complexes [162]. All the indications
suggest that this procedure led to the formation of the complex
[Ni13 (N3 )6 (O2 CMe)8 (L221)12 (MeOH)10 ], although crystallographic
evidence could not be obtained.
4. Coordination compounds with spin-crossover properties
The spin-crossover (SCO) phenomenon is a purely molecular
property of transition metal ions related to the population of a

metastable state exhibiting a higher spin than the ground state.
This event basically occurs as the result of the interplay between the
dependence of the ligand-ﬁeld (LF) strength on the metal-to-ligand
distance and the electron-electron repulsion. It has been observed
in coordination complexes of 3d transition-metal ions with d4
to d7 electronic conﬁgurations. Nevertheless, the vast majority
of SCO complexes involve iron(II), usually in a close to octahedral FeN6 environment. As depicted in Fig. 60, iron(II) systems
are more interesting since the SCO occurs between a diamagnetic
low-spin (LS) S = 0 ground state and a high-spin (HS) paramagnetic
S = 2 metastable state. In addition, a thermochromic effect is often
accompanying the SCO in compounds of this metal ion. Thermal
SCO occurs quantitatively as a result of the higher entropy of the
HS state and follows a Boltzmann’s population law for complexes
in solution. In the solid state, secondary effects such as packing
or cooperative interactions are responsible for the observation a
different types of SCO behaviour. In particular, cooperative effects
[163–165] may lead to extremely abrupt thermal spin changes,
that may occur with hysteretic loops, therefore giving a bistable
character to the transition. A schematic representation of an ideal
thermal SCO curve with a cooperative behaviour, a crucial feature
for potential applications in information storage or optical devices
[166], is shown in Fig. 60, right. In the absence of cooperativity,
the SCO occurs in one sole step; however, the presence of different
SCO centers or competing interactions in the solid may result in
two-step SCO. The HS state can be trapped either through thermal
quenching or by irradiation with an adequate wavelength, the lat-

ter being the most interesting photophysical effect for iron(II). This
light-induced effect or LIESST (Light-Induced Excited Spin-State
Trapping) has been widely studied and is reversible in some compounds (reverse-LIESST) [167]. The SCO phenomenon is now well
understood, and the reader is referred to a number of recognized
references compiling these investigations [168,169].
Although triazoles and tetrazoles possess a rich variety of binding and bridging modes (see Schemes 5–7), their most relevant
advantage here is their particular donor strength as ligands in
iron(II) complexes. Indeed, triazoles and tetrazoles are well suited
to produce the above-mentioned FeN6 octahedral environment
around iron(II). Actually, the LF strengths provided by these azole
rings are in the ideal range for the occurrence of SCO with this metal
ion. Thus, some of the most studied SCO compounds are triazole
or tetrazole-containing monomers, and have been obtained only
with iron(II). This section covers the whole family of iron(II) coor-

dination compounds containing at least one triazole or tetrazole
ring. It is ﬁrst organized by azole type, and then by nuclearity/dimensionality of the SCO compounds. A succinct description
of the structure and SCO properties is given for an ample selection of these. All compounds described in the literature are listed
in Tables 4 (triazoles) and 5 (tetrazoles), together with the corresponding references. In addition, the structural information and
the SCO properties (temperature range, type of SCO, and techniques used) are summarized. When relevant, the description
focuses on structural aspects inﬂuencing the SCO. The importance
of packing interactions will be highlighted. Selected experimental (mostly magnetic) data describing the SCO phenomenon in
the featured examples are given as found in the literature, either
for their originality, interest or typical character. We have used
T as a unifying presentation of the bulk, variable temperature
magnetization data, the original data being reported either in HS
fraction, , T, eff or 2eff . SCO triazole and tetrazole compounds
have been previously partially reviewed [170,171], especially for
monomers [172]. The 1,2,3- and 1,2,4-triazole ligands involved in
SCO complexes are shown in Fig. 61 and the tetrazole ones in
Fig. 82.
4.1. Complexes of 1,2,3-triazole ligands
The 1,2,3-triazole ring is by far the least used for the generation
of SCO coordination compounds. This is in part due to the relatively
little abundance of coordination complexes with this type of ligand.
Because of their scarcity, 1,2,3-triazole-based SCO compounds will
be described here in greater detail compared to those obtained from
1,2,4-triazole and tetrazole ligands.
4.1.1. Monomers
There is only one family of monomeric SCO complexes
bearing a 1,2,3-triazole ligand, i.e. solvated and unsolvated
complexes with formula trans-[Fe(L224)2 (NCX)2 ], where L224 = 3(2-pyridyl)[1,2,3]triazolo[1,5-a]pyridine and X = S or Se. The
bidentate ligand L224 contains a 1,2,3-triazole ring and a pyridyl
group, and is chelating like 2,2’-bipyridine (Fig. 62). The X = S
complex was ﬁrst reported as di-chloroform (SCO1) and water
(SCO2) solvates [173]; however, only the triclinic crystal struc-

ture of SCO1 was solved. The solvent-free compound was later
shown to crystallize as two polymorphs, either monoclinic (SCO3A)
or triclinic (SCO3B) [174]. The selenium derivative (X = Se) was
reported with no solvent lattice molecules (SCO4), although its
crystal structure was not determined [173]. It can be noticed that
the coordination compound with three chelating L224 ligands, i.e.
[Fe(L224)3 ](BF4 )2 , does not show a SCO behaviour, like [Fe(bpy)3 ]2+
complexes. This absence of SCO can be explained by an increase of
the LF strength caused by the replacement of the NCX− donors by
comparatively stronger aromatic N donors. Hence, the compound
[Fe(L224)3 ](BF4 )2 exhibits a LS state over the whole studied temperature range [173].

In all the [Fe(L224)2 (NCX)2 ] series, the neutral complex core
is comparable (Fig. 62), with two L224 ligands coordinated at the
equatorial positions and two NCX− groups occupying the axial sites.
The resulting trans coordination compound possesses a rather symmetric FeN6 octahedral coordination environment, with Fe–N bond
distances at 293 K of 2.217–2.193 A˚ (pyridine), 2.211–2.174 A˚ (triazole) and 2.107–2.113 A˚ (NCX− ). All these bond lengths are typical
of an iron(II) center in the HS state. In SCO3A, for which the structure of the LS phase was also solved at 40 K, the FeN6 octahedron
decreases in volume from 13.1 to 10.1 A˚ 3 upon going from the HS to
the LS state. Moreover, the coordination geometry is much closer to
a regular octahedron, as commonly observed for SCO iron(II) com-

plexes. ␲–␲ interactions between the L224 ligands, present in all
the series, result in the formation of layers, where all complexes are
orientated in the same direction (same Nthio –Fe–Nthio axes) in the
triclinic structures SCO1 and SCO3B, or in two alternating orientations (related by symmetry) in the monoclinic structure SCO3A
(Fig. 63).
The ␲–␲ interactions are stronger in SCO3B (intercentroid dis˚ than in SCO3A (distances of 3.608

˚ respectively, generating inter-layer Fe···Fe distances of
and 3.621 A,
12.375 and 9.343 A˚ (see Fig. 63).
These packing differences affect both the temperature of the
SCO and its cooperative character and completeness (Fig. 62, bottom). The dramatic increase in T1/2 between SCO3B and SCO4, of
about 150 K, is much larger than expected from the sole inﬂuence on the ligand-ﬁeld strength of the less electronegative NCSe−
anion, for which shifts of only 20–50 K have been observed. Therefore, although the structure of the selenium derivative has not been
reported, it appears that packing features participate as well in the
observed increase of T1/2 . Indeed, small variations in the packing
between very similar complexes can justify signiﬁcant disparities
in the SCO behaviour within a family of related compounds. The
SCO curves for the solvent-free compound SCO3 are clearly more
cooperative, as a result of direct inter-sheet interactions. In contrast, these interactions occur through the solvent molecule for the
chloroform solvate SCO1, or the analogous hydrated compound.
For the polymorph SCO3B, these interactions take place between

polymorphs of [Fe(L224)2 (NCS)2 ] [173], monoclinic (middle) and triclinic (bottom),

identical layers, resulting in a much shorter interlayer Fe···Fe distance; in addition, it also exhibits the shortest ␲–␲ interactions
within the sheets. These peculiarities can reasonably explain the
particular SCO properties of SCO3B, which are the most cooperative of the series. The two-step SCO curve of the polymorph SCO3A
is also ascribed to inter-sheet interactions. In fact, the existence
of two types of sheets of differently oriented complexes creates
a competition between short- and long-range interactions, which
are known to potentially produce intermediate HS-LS states, and
therefore two-step transitions [165]. Photomagnetic studies have
been performed with both the chloroform solvate SCO1 [173] and
the solvent-free compound SCO3A [174]. In both cases, the relaxation from the light-induced HS state was exponential, i.e. mostly
non-cooperative. To avoid the effect of this relaxation, the crystal structure of the excited phase of SCO3A was solved through
pump–probe experiments at 40 K [174]. The resulting structure was
very similar to the HS one at 200 K.
4.1.2. Extended systems (2D)
The only other SCO compound containing a 1,2,3-triazole ligand reported so far, namely [Fe(L225)3 ]n (ClO4 )2n (Fig. 64), is
a 2D coordination polymer built from the bridging ligand 1,4di(1,2,3-triazol-1-yl)-butane (L225) [175]. In the P 3¯ structure, each
1,2,3-triazole ring coordinates the iron(II) ions in a monodentate
fashion, generating regular octahedral Fe(triazole)6 building blocks

G. Aromí et al. / Coordination Chemistry Reviews 255 (2011) 485–546

˚ to
that are connected to six neighbors (Fe···Fe distance of 11.719 A)
produce 2D sheets (Fig. 64). The ligand is sitting on an inversion
centre and has a Gauche–Trans–Gauche conformation; hence, the
triazole rings of L225 are trans and therefore allow the bridging of
neighboring iron(II) ions. The resulting layers are arranged in a parallel manner along the c axis, leaving triangular channels in which
the perchlorate anions are pillared. The layers interact through several C–H···O–Cl hydrogen bonds involving the perchlorate ions. The
˚ is shorter than the intra-layer
inter-layer Fe···Fe distance (7.804 A)
one.
[Fe(L225)3 ]n (ClO4 )2n exhibits a complete SCO with a 8 K wide
up
down = 101 K. While the 2D sheet
hysteresis T1/2 = 109 K and T1/2
structure with the direct Fe–Fe links and the inter-sheet hydrogen
bonding interactions may produce a cooperative SCO, it is unclear
whether the hysteresis can be ascribed only to such cooperativity. Indeed, the branches of the hysteresis loop are not parallel to
each other: the warming branch presents some asymmetry with a
up
change of slope at T > T1/2 . This asymmetric character is conﬁrmed
by thermal measurements, the anomaly associated with the SCO in
differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) upon warming being clearly
associated to two peaks. Although the LS structure could not be
solved, it appears that a structural phase transition is coupled to
the SCO in [Fe(L225)3 ]n (ClO4 )2n , which is probably at the origin of
both the occurrence of hysteresis and the asymmetric SCO curves.
4.2. Complexes of 1,2,4-triazoles
Ligands containing a 1,2,4-triazole ring have been extensively
used for the design and preparation of SCO materials. In particular, this ring has been combined with a wide range of other
donors resulting in numerous molecular complexes of nuclearities ranging from 1, by far the most common, to 3. Although the
1,2,4-triazole ring itself has several coordination bridging modes,
and many ligands with more than one 1,2,4-triazole groups have
been used, the number of extended coordination networks with
this donor exhibiting SCO properties is extremely limited, except
for unidimensional systems formed through the 1,2 bridging
mode (Scheme 7). This is most likely due to the fact that monocoordinating 1,2,4-triazole ligands generate weak ligand ﬁelds and
almost systematically yield HS coordination compounds. For all
the few exceptions showing a SCO behaviour, the triazole ring is
involved in some supramolecular interactions that compensate this

523

effect through the modiﬁcation of its donor strength. SCO triazole
compounds have been partially reviewed in 2004 [170,171] and
2007 [172].
4.2.1. Monomers
Terminal 1,2,4-triazole ligands are weak donors; therefore, they
stabilize the HS state of the corresponding mononuclear coordination compounds. A recent extensive review on mononuclear iron(II)
complexes obtained from nitrogen-donor ligands[172] includes
all triazole-containing mononuclear SCO complexes reported at
the time. In the present section, an updated exhaustive list of
such complexes is given together with relevant details and properties (Table 4). However, only a selected example per type of
ligand/complex geometry/composition will be described.
4.2.1.1. Monodentate
triazole. Similarly
to
the
[Fe(hydrotris(pyrazol-1-yl)borate)2 ] system, known to display
an abrupt SCO in some cases above RT [176], the 1,2,4-triazole
analogue [Fe(L62)2 ] consists of a mononuclear neutral complex, with an iron(II) center surrounded octahedrally by six
N1-donating 1,2,4-triazole rings (Fig. 65). [Fe(L62)2 ] crystallizes
as a hexahydrate LS compound, as indicated by the average
Fe–N bond length of 1.99 A˚ at RT [177]. The anhydrous form,
however, displays an abrupt and complete SCO at ca. 340 K [178].
The SCO was also shown to take place in solution. Dilution with
zinc(II) of the crystalline material result in a drastic diminution
of the cooperative character of the SCO [178]. This compound
is the only monomeric iron(II) SCO complex from monodentate
N1-1,2,4-triazole ligand(s). Nevertheless, it should be noted that
the N2 nitrogen of the azole rings in L62− is connected to a
boron atom; therefore, the 1,2,4-triazole moiety in L62− acts as
a N1,N2-bridging ligand. This particular circumstance apparently
allows the generation of a favorable environment for the SCO to
occur.
4.2.1.2. Ligands with the 1,2,4-triazole ring pertaining to a diimine coordination pocket. With di-imine triazole ligands, the SCO
phenomenon has been observed either in [Fe(L)3 ]2+ complexes
(L = HL69, L226, HL218, L227, HL228, and L208) with different
anions and distinct degrees of hydration, or in [Fe(L)2 (X)2 ] complexes (L = L199, L229, L200, and L230) in which L is always a
chelating ligand and X is a terminal cyanide-like donor such as

NCS− , NCSe− , N(CN)2 − or TCNQ− (see Table 4). The asymmetric
nature of 2-pyridyl-1,2,4-triazole ligands may lead to the formation
of [Fe(L)3 ]2+ complexes having a facial or a meridional geometry.
In all crystal structures so far solved, the sole meridional geometry has been observed, which is common for iron(II) coordination
compounds. Thus, mer-[Fe(HL69)3 ](BF4 )2 ·2H2 O (Fig. 66) displays a
very gradual SCO centered at ca. 135 K, and presents a large residual
HS fraction of ca. 30% [179]. Its crystal structure has been reported
both in the HS state (295 K) and in the LS state (90 K). In addition to
the usual HS-to-LS shortening of the Fe–N average bond length (ca.
˚ the chelate bite angle of the ligand increases and the FeN6
0.15 A),
octahedron is more regular in the (mostly) LS phase. The anion and
solvent areas could not be resolved, with a strong rotational and
positional disorder of the BF4 − anions suggesting the absence of
distinct intermolecular interactions. Detailed calorimetric as well
as photomagnetic studies have been reported for this system [180].
The fac geometry with bis-N-donor chelates apparently favors the
LS state [181,182].
A similar solid-state structure is observed with the ligand
1-methyl-3-(pyrazin-2-yl)-1,2,4-triazole (L208) in the hydrated
complex [Fe(L208)3 ](ClO4 )2 ·H2 O (Fig. 67). This compound exhibits
a LS state up to 296 K, with a regular octahedron and characteristic
HS Fe–N bond lengths, both at 150 and 296 K [101]. The anhydrous compound does exhibit a SCO behaviour resembling that of
[Fe(HL69)3 ](BF4 )2 ·2H2 O, with a gradual transition centered at ca.
175 K and a residual HS fraction of about 40%. Interestingly, the
PF6 − and BF4 − complexes display pure LS populations at temperatures up to ca. 290 K, with their SCO being centered around 400 K.
The crystal structures of these anhydrous complexes could not be
solved.

Such difﬁculties in obtaining good crystals and/or good quality crystal structures are very common for this type of systems
[101,179,183–185]. In most reported structures, highly disordered
areas, including the anions and/or unresolved solvent molecules,
were detected. This almost systematic poor crystallinity/disorder
most likely explains the residual HS fractions observed in bulk samples of these materials. In addition, the presence of such highly
disordered areas results in isolated SCO complexes, hence justifying
the gradual character of the transition curves observed invariably
for these systems. The apparent absence of signiﬁcant intermolecular interactions between the complexes in the solid state is quite
surprising since most of the ligands used have at least one nitrogen atom (hydrogen bond acceptor) and in some cases an N–H
moiety (hydrogen bond donor) that in principle should allow the
formation of hydrogen-bonding contacts. Besides, the preparation
of these compounds is often performed in water or alcoholic conditions (which should favour the generation of hydrogen-bonding
networks).
Among the di-imine triazole ligands, the case of 3,5-bis(pyridin2-yl)-1,2,4-triazoles (usually abbreviated as Rdpt, R being the
substituent on the N4 of the triazole ring) is peculiar as this family of ligands contain two coordination pockets, and may thus
form dinuclear compounds (see below). SCO compounds with these
ligands have been reviewed recently [186a]. In monomers, the presence of the second pyridyl moiety may render the formation of a
[Fe(L)3 ]2+ complex more difﬁcult. Nevertheless both the mer and
fac [M(Rdpt)3 ]2+ complexes have been reported with several ﬁrstrow transition-metal ions [186a], and this arrangement of Rdpt
ligands with iron(II) has recently been reported, although no SCO
was observed [186b].
A synthetic strategy to obtain mononuclear complexes with
this type of ligands is to combine in the same reaction
Rdpt with other nitrogen donors. An interesting example is
[Fe(L199)(DAPP)](ClO4 )2 (Fig. 68), obtained from the tetradentate chelating ligand bis-(3-aminopropyl)(2-pyridylmethyl)amine
(DAPP). This iron(II) compound shows an abrupt SCO with a 10 K
wide hysteresis in the range 165–185 K (see Fig. 68, bottom) [187].
Structural investigations at 123 K (LS state) and at 183 and
293 K (HS state) revealed the importance of both, a network of
intermolecular interactions and two order-disorder transitions
involving the methylene carbon of the ligand DAPP and one of
the two perchlorate ions for the occurrence of the cooperative
SCO observed. Indeed, hydrogen-bonding contacts between the
perchlorate ions, the amino group of L199 and the methylene
groups of DAPP result in the formation of layers of interacting complexes. These layers further interact through ␲–␲ stacking between
pyridyl rings of L199 ligands. Although it is unclear whether the
order–disorder transitions are strongly coupled to the SCO phe-

nomenon, an ordering of the DAPP ligands occurs in the range
of the HS to LS transition, namely between 183 and 123 K, while
the perchlorate ion is disordered at 183 K, just above the transition. Studies on the coupling between the order–disorder and
the SCO in this compound using adiabatic calorimetry coupled to
spectroscopic experiments and vibrational calculations were later
reported, evidencing a self-grinding effect of the crystals upon
cycling the transitions [188].
Another strategy to obtain mononuclear compounds with
di-imine chelating ligands consists in combining them with
cyanide-type coordinating anions. This approach is widely used to
obtain mononuclear SCO complexes, also with triazole-based ligands. While almost only the thiocyanate and selenocyanate anions
have been used, a large series with relative N-donor strength
NCO− < NCS− < NCSe− < N(CN)2 − < C(CN)3 − < NCBH3 − < NCCH3 − < <
CN− , offers a unique way to adjust the ligand ﬁeld around the
metal ion. The most commonly used anion is thiocyanate, and
all corresponding complexes exhibiting SCO have a trans conﬁguration, with four nitrogen donors from two di-imine ligands in
the equatorial positions and two axial cyanide-type donors. An
remarkable illustration of this type of materials is the neutral

complex [Fe(L199)2 (TCNQ)2 ], obtained from L199 and the radical
anion TCNQ− , which represents the ﬁrst hybrid SCO compound
[189]. Its SCO curve is complete and gradual, the spin change
occurring over more than 100 K and being centered at ca. 280 K.
Its structure was solved at 100 K (LS state) and 293 K (mostly HS
state). The TCNQ radical anions are mono-coordinated through
one of their nitrile group, the corresponding average Fe–N bond
length exhibiting one of the largest reported LS-to-HS variation
˚ This change of distance was ascribed to the extended ␲

system of TCNQ, which favours back-bonding in the LS state, and
thus shorter Fe–N bond lengths. The TCNQ moieties of neighboring
complexes are strongly ␲-stacked (centroid-to-centroid distances
of 3.265/3.321 A˚ in the LS/HS states, respectively), forming 1D
supramolecular chains (see Fig. 69). The stacked radical dimers
are thus strongly antiferromagnetically coupled and are therefore
diamagnetic over the whole temperature range studied. This is
common with coordinated TCNQ. As in most related compounds,
the HS-to-LS transition induces an increase of the di-imine bite
angle, and a comparatively more regular octahedral environment.
A number of similar 1:2 complexes with other terminal anionic
donors or Rdpt ligands have also been isolated (see Table 4) and
reviewed recently [186a]. Since then, two new polymorphs (C and
D) of trans-[Fe(L199)2 (NCS)2 ] have been reported that exhibit SCO
properties for only half of the iron(II) centers [190]. While in the
original polymorph A [191] there is only one type of complex
arranged in ␲-stacked layers, in polymorphs C and D there are
two types of such layers, with different orientations, corresponding to two crystallographic iron sites. Similarly to the family of
trans-[Fe(L224)2 (NCX)2 ] complexes, structural analysis indicates
that the varying SCO properties within the different polymorphs
of this compound (see Fig. 70 bottom) are mostly dominated by
the relative strength of the ␲–␲ interactions between L199 planes
in the stacked layers, as well as by inter-sheet interactions through
the thiocyanate ions (Fig. 70, top). The planarity of the L199 ligand is
one of the parameters which differ among the different polymorphs
of this compound. The HS state of this system has been trapped
thermally and through light-irradiation, allowing the observation
of both incommensurate and commensurate modulated structures
in two different polymorphs [174,190]. Very recently, a novel compound has been reported that contains co-crystallized cis and trans
isomers of [Fe(L200)2 (NCS)2 ] in a 2:1 ratio. A partial SCO of ca. 1/3
of the iron(II) ions around 180 K in the unsolvated compound is
observed that is ascribed to the trans isomer [192]. Strikingly, the
pure trans isomer does not show a SCO behaviour, thus indicating
an important role played by the packing in the cis-trans co-crystal.
4.2.1.3. Ligands with a fused 1,2,4-triazole ring. With a fused 1,2,4triazole ring, the only SCO complex reported so far has been isolated
recently using the same synthetic procedure as above, with NCS−
anions [193]. The triclinic neutral complex [Fe(L230)2 (NCS)2 ] has

a trans conﬁguration (Fig. 71) and strongly resembles its 1,2,3triazole analogue with L224 (SCO3A), which exhibits ␲-staked
layers with alternating orientations (see Fig. 62, top). The main
structural differences are the tighter bite angle of the 1,2,3-triazole
analogue, and the absence of solvent molecules in the structure of
[Fe(L230)2 (NCS)2 ].
In addition, [Fe(L230)2 (NCS)2 ] exhibits ␲-stacking interactions
between neighboring complexes forming layers between shifted
planes, therefore leading to weaker interactions. Although similar
˚ are observed, the differS···H–C interlayer interactions (3.490 A)
ences most likely justify the comparatively more gradual (more
than 100 K wide) SCO observed for [Fe(L230)2 (NCS)2 ], centered at
ca. 270 K. Quite remarkably, T1/2 shows an increase of ca. 150 K with
respect to the 1,2,3-triazole analogue.
4.2.1.4. Ligands with 1,2,4-triazole pertaining to a tris-imine coordination pocket. Chelating tris-imine ligands bearing either one or
two 1,2,4-triazole ring(s) have also been used to prepare mononuclear iron(II) SCO complexes, isolated as hydrated [Fe(L)2 ]2+ salts
with various anions (see Table 4). These complexes have a similar
FeN6 octahedron formed by two ␩3 chelating ligands whose planes
are roughly perpendicular (see Figs. 72 and 73). With the symmetric di-(1,2,4-triazol-3-yl)-pyridine ligands H2 L231 and H2 L232, the
complex core is very similar to that of the pyrazole analogues,
which have been widely investigated due to the very cooperative SCO displayed by their anhydrous forms [194]. In the case of
1,2,4-triazoles, all hydrates, e.g. those that could be structurally

characterized such as [Fe(H2 L231)2 ](NO3 )2 ·2H2 O (Fig. 72), were
HS compounds [172]. The anhydrous chloride salt was LS, while
the anhydrous BF4 − and ClO4 − salts did show a gradual SCO
[195]. Unfortunately, these anhydrous compounds could not be
structurally characterized. This is reminiscent of the pyrazole systems, whose hydrates have gradual SCO and could be structurally
characterized, while the anhydrous forms with cooperative SCO
properties at higher temperatures could not. This sensitivity to
water has been proposed to be used in sensors for moisture detection [196].
Several hydrated complexes obtained from 2-(1,2,4-triazol-3yl)-1,10-phenantroline, substituted or not with one or two methyl
group(s) show SCO properties and have been structurally characterized [737–738]. For instance, the monohydrate compound

[Fe(L236)2 ](ClO4 )2 ·H2 O, whose cation is shown in Fig. 73, exhibits

The structure shows positional disorder of the perchlorate anions,
and although the water molecule forms a hydrogen bond with one
of these perchlorate groups, the cation does not participate in any
intermolecular network, thus justifying the very gradual character
of the SCO for this compound.
4.2.2. Dimers
The ␮1,2 bridging coordination mode is quite common for
1,2,4-triazoles, as seen in section 3. Nevertheless, it is often complemented by an additional bridging moiety such as a halide,
and the effect of such weak donors on the ligand-ﬁeld strength
usually results in a HS ground state for the iron(II) center of
dimeric species. There are only three exceptions reported so
far. The ﬁrst one belongs to the family of the dinuclear compounds [Fe2 (L75)2 X2 (solv.)2 ] [68,186], in which each pocket of
the L75− ligand chelates an iron(II) ion. The two deprotonated
L75-ligands in trans conﬁguration generate a double planar 1,2triazolate bridge, the axial positions of the coordination sphere of
the iron(II) ions being completed by coordinated anions, i.e. NCS− ,
NCSe− , NCBH3 − and Cl− , and either methanol or pyridine solvent
molecules. Though, a SCO behaviour has only been observed for
[Fe2 (L75)2 (NCBH3 )2 py2 ] [197]. Quite interestingly, this compound
displays a complete SCO with two distinct steps, and a small plateau
in the range 155–185 K (see Fig. 74 right), suggesting that the
complex may exist in three different states, namely the [HS–HS],
[HS–LS] and [LS–LS] states. Unfortunately, no crystal structure was
reported for this speciﬁc compound, therefore impeding to discard
the possibility of a 1:1 [HS–HS]:[LS–LS] mixture.
A similar dinuclear complex, namely [Fe2 (L237)2 ](BF4 )4 ·DMF, is
formed with the ligand 3,5-bis-(2-pyridylmethyl-methylamino)4-amino-1,2,4-triazole (L237 or PMAT), a bis-terdentate ligand
containing two chelating N,N pockets formed by the N1 and N2
donors of a central triazole ring, two secondary amine nitrogens,
and two pyridyl arms [198a]. The latter N-donors occupy the
axial positions of both iron(II) ions, while the equatorial positions are occupied by two double coplanar 1,2-triazole bridges and
the secondary amine donors. Due to the rigidity of the ligand, a
rather tightly constrained complex is obtained (Fig. 74, left). This
compound exhibits an abrupt SCO involving only one of the two
iron ions. Its crystal structure determined in the low-temperature
phase, i.e. at 123 K, clearly demonstrates that the complex is trapped
in the intermediate localized [LS–HS] state. Mössbauer studies later
conﬁrmed this mixed-spin state [198b], and the effect of applied

pressure and irradiation were also investigated [198c]. The occurrence of the mixed [LS–HS] spin pair is most likely due to constraints
inherent to the complex. This unique result highlights the potential of suitably designed macrocyclic or acyclic polydentate ligands
implementing a central bridging moiety, such as a 1,2,4-triazole
ring, to generate cooperative polymetallic SCO molecules.
Besides these two peculiar compounds, SCO complexes bearing N1,N2 bridging triazoles involve triple-triazole bridges. The
stability of the resulting conformation in these triple-triazole
bridges results in a tendency to extend the coordination into 1D
systems. Consequently, the isolation of oligomeric systems showing SCO properties and based on these triple triazole bridges is
quite difﬁcult and has been limited to only trimers (see following section), and one sole dimer [199]. The two iron(II) ions of
the dimer are bridged solely by three 4-(p-tolyl)-1,2,4-triazoles
(L238), through their N1,N2 pairs. The coordination sphere of
the iron(II) centers is completed by two thiocyanate anions and
one terminal L238 ligand. The neutral dimer [Fe2 (L238)5 (NCS)4 ]
co-crystallizes in a 2:1 ratio with a neutral monomer of formula [Fe(NCS)2 (L238)2 (H2 O)2 ], thus forming a pentanuclear
supramolecular assembly through strong H-bonds between the
free N2 atom of the terminal L238 of the dimers and the coordinated water molecules (see Fig. 75). The dimeric coordination unit
in [Fe2 (L238)5 (NCS)4 ][Fe(NCS)2 (L238)2 (H2 O)2 ] exhibits cis thiocyanate ions whereas in similar complexes with other metal(II) ions
(see Section 3), these anions are in trans conformation. The cis coordination of the NCS− ions is forced by the hydrogen bond formed

528

between the terminal L238 ligand and the central iron(II) unit. Similarly to [Fe(L62)2 ] where the N1-donating triazole rings have their
N2 atom linked to a boron atom, these hydrogen bonds probably
induce a modiﬁcation of the donor strength of the terminal N1donating atom of the L238 ligand. Indeed, while the iron(II) ions
bearing monocoordinated 1,2,4-triazole are usually HS, such as the
central metal ion of [Fe2 (L238)5 (NCS)4 ]2 [Fe(NCS)2 (L238)2 (H2 O)2 ],
the iron(II) ions in the dinuclear unit exhibit a complete, 40 K wide
SCO, centered at 111 K.
4.2.3. Trimers
As mentioned above, polynuclear linear-chain products can be
formed through successive triple 1,2 triazole bridges that connect the transition-metal ions. The iron(II) compounds are among
the most interesting and widely studied SCO compounds, and will
be described in the next section. Nevertheless, so far no crystal
structure of such coordination polymers could be obtained, and
they therefore remain ill-deﬁned polymeric materials, for which
smaller iron(II) oligomeric well-deﬁned systems can serve as models. In this respect, trinuclear complexes seem to be for geometric
reasons the most stable models of 1D repeated triple triazole
bridges. A number of such compounds exhibiting SCO properties, with formulae [Fe3 (4-R-1,2,4-triazole)6 (H2 O)6 ](A)6 ·nH2 O or
[Fe3 (4-R-1,2,4-triazole)8 (H2 O)4 ](A)6 ·nH2 O, have been isolated. The
disparities between theses systems result from the different substituents R on the 4-position of the 1,2,4-triazole ligand, the anion
A and the degree of hydration n (see Table 4).
The ﬁrst trinuclear compound of the series was reported in 1983
with the ligand L193 [200], soon after the ﬁrst reports on 1D polymers, by the same research group at Leiden University [201]. The
structures, solved at 300 and 105 K (corresponding to a HS and a
LS state for the central iron(II) ion, respectively) [202], show a linear trinuclear unit formed through the bridging of the three iron(II)
ions by two successive groups of three N1,N2-donating triazole ligands. The triazole units are shifted from one bridge to the other
resulting in a propeller arrangement (Fig. 76, top). Hence, the central iron(II) ion is octahedrally surrounded by six triazole N-donors,
a favorable feature for the occurrence of SCO. Actually, the main
structural variations upon cooling are the decrease of about 0.14 A˚
of the central Fe–N bond lengths, associated with the SCO of this ion,
and the slight reorientations of the triazole rings induced by the volume reduction of the coordination sphere of the central iron(II). The
octahedral environment of each outer iron(II) ion is completed by
three water molecules, that form hydrogen bonds with the lattice
triﬂate anions.
The structures of the other members [121,203–205,739,740]
of this family of compounds are very similar. The most important variation in this series is the replacement of one of the
water molecules coordinated to the outer iron(II) ions by a terminal triazole ligand, for instance in [Fe3 (L250)8 (H2 O)4 ](BF4 )6
and [Fe3 (L251)8 (H2 O)4 ](NO3 )6 . In the former compound, the three
iron(II) ions remain HS, while the central iron(II) ion displays a
gradual SCO phenomenon in all other cases (the external iron(II)
centers remaining in HS state). The most cooperative SCO transition
is observed for the compound with the ligand L193, whereas the
other ones present similar albeit more gradual transitions, at temperatures ranging from 185 to 290 K. Even the compound obtained
from the ligand 4-hydroxyethyl-1,2,4-triazole (HL82) [204], in an
attempt to favor hydrogen-bonding interactions and thus intermolecular contacts, exhibits a gradual transition. Although the
environment of the central iron(II) is analogous in this series of
compounds, both the substituent on the triazole ligand and the
anion have an obvious impact on the transition temperature (see
Table 4 and Fig. 76, bottom).
It can be noticed that two linear trinuclear complexes have
been very recently reported with the ligands 4-isopropyl-3,5-di-

Fig. 76. (top) The cationic complex in the ﬁrst reported trinuclear SCO compound, [Fe3 (L193)6 (H2 O)6 ](CF3 SO3 )6 [202]. Only the central iron(II) exhibits a SCO
behaviour. (bottom) T versus T plot showing the SCO properties of four similar trinuclear compounds, differing in the substituent on the 4-position of the 1,2,4-triazole
and in the anion used.

(pyrid-2-yl)-1,2,4-triazole and 4-phenyl-3,5-di-(pyrid-2-yl)-1,2,4triazole in combination with terminal thiocyanate anions [206].
In these complexes, the bidentate pockets from two Rdpt ligands
bridge the iron(II) ions, while two other Rdpt molecules act as
chelating ligands to bind the external iron(II) ions. The octahedral
FeN6 environment of the three iron(II) ions is completed by two
trans NCS− anions, thus resulting in a coordination sphere closely
related to that of mononuclear SCO complexes with dpt-type ligands. Although these complexes do not exhibit SCO properties,
this similarity and the fact that they have differing spin states,
respectively [LS–HS–LS] and [HS–HS–HS], is appealing since slight
modiﬁcations of the electron-donating ability of the 4-substituent
on the central triazole ring may yield new SCO trinuclear complexes.

4.2.4. 1D compounds
The triple ␮1,2 1,2,4-triazole bridges between iron(II) ions
present in linear trinuclear complexes tend to extend into longer
linear assemblies, such as those found in structurally characterized
copper(II) analogues [207–209], at least for 1,2,4-triazoles bearing
4-substituents that do not impede such assembly due to bulkiness, as would do for instance substituents at the 3 and 5 positions.
The resulting iron(II) coordination polymers all exhibit SCO properties, in general with abrupt transitions apparently induced by an
efﬁcient propagation along the chains through direct covalent connections of the local modiﬁcations due to the SCO. Unfortunately,
such materials are isolated as ﬁne microcrystalline powders at best,
and so far no single-crystal structure could be determined. Nevertheless, a combination of EXAFS and WAXS experiments, as well as
comparisons with structurally characterized copper(II) analogues
(when available) have allowed a satisfactory (structural) description of these materials [209–212]. It appears that these compounds
contain ﬁnite linear chains of iron(II) ions triply bridged by triazole
rings (through the N1 and N2 donor atoms) and separated by a dis˚ depending on the spin state (Fig. 77, top). All the
tance of 3.6–3.7 A,
iron(II) ions within the chain thus have an octahedral FeN6 environment comparable to that observed for the central iron(II) ion
in linear trinuclear assemblies. Consequently, these iron(II) centers
hold the coordination characteristics that favor SCO properties. The
coordination sphere of the terminal iron(II) ions is believed to be
completed by solvent molecules, i.e. either water or alcohols, or
N1-monodonating triazoles. The anions are expected to be located
in between the linear chains, possibly interacting through hydrogen bonds with either the substituent on the triazole ligands or

529

directly with the triazole ring. This is particularly true for the model
compound [Fe(HL21)2 (L21)]n (BF4 )n whose extended network of
hydrogen bonds between the tetraﬂuoroborate anions and the C–H
groups of protonated triazoles has been singled out as the origin of
its unusually abrupt transitions and large hysteresis of 40 K above
room temperature (Fig. 77, bottom) [213,214]. These unique cooperative properties at useful temperatures, coupled to a pronounced
thermochromism (often observed for iron(II) SCO materials), and
the synthetic ability to tune the material properties without losing most of its interesting features, have attracted much interest
because this system appears to be ideal for potential technological
applications of SCO [166].
The SCO properties of these polymeric materials can be ﬁne
tuned through variations of (i) the substituent at the N4 position
of the triazole ring, (ii) the non-coordinating anions or (iii) the
solvent conditions and/or solvent content. Families of compounds
formulated as [Fe(4-R-1,2,4-triazole)3 ]n (A)2n ·nH2 O have thus been
reported by several groups worldwide, a selection of relevant ones
being gathered in Table 4. The donor strength of the R substituent
at the N4 position can be modiﬁed, with a direct consequence on
the ligand ﬁeld around the iron(II) ion, and thus on T1/2 . For example, the adjustment of the composition of a mixed-ligand system,
i.e. [Fe(HL21)3−3x (L31)3x ]n (ClO4 )2n ·nH2 O, has allowed the preparation of a material with an abrupt transition and a large hysteresis
centered at 25 ◦ C [215], which is one of the pre-requisites for a possible application in optical devices [166]. The 4-substituent can also
have a strong inﬂuence on the size of the oligomeric coordination
chains as well as on the cooperative character of the SCO [741]. The
nature of the anion A has even a stronger effect on T1/2 . For instance,
a linear correlation has been found between this temperature and
the volume of spherical anions with HL82 [216], showing that the
SCO transition temperature can be ﬁne-tuned through this simple synthetic parameter. Anions including a sulfonate group, such
as p-tolylsulfonate or naphtalenesulfonate, usually yield materials
that are LS at room temperature and exhibit abrupt SCO above RT
[217,218]. These features have been ascribed to the formation of
bridging hydrogen bonds with C–H groups from neighboring triazole rings [219]. Most interestingly, in some of these sulfonate
compounds, lattice water molecules are lost irreversibly by the
initial LS compound at temperatures in the range 320–340 K. The
resulting dehydrated materials then exhibit SCO properties at much
lower temperatures. While the stabilization effect of the LS state by
lattice water molecules is well documented, the abruptness of the
irreversible LS-to-HS change and the large difference of the transition temperatures between the hydrated and dehydrated materials
has led to a proposed application as temperature threshold sensor
[216,218].
A number of recent works on this system have indeed been
devoted to the design of materials with improved potentiality for
applications. Plastic composites were obtained by simple blending with polymethylmetacrylate or introducing a polymerizable
function on the N4 position of the triazole [220,221]. Typical
substituents of organic liquid crystals were successfully used to
isolate 1D polymeric materials exhibiting SCO properties as well
as a thermotropic liquid crystal phases [222]. Using long alkylchain substituents, it was also shown that these materials can
be transferred into soft matter phases such as Langmuir–Blodgett
ﬁlms [223,224], and physical gels [219,225,226] without loss of
their SCO properties. Along the same line, dispersable nanoparticles of these materials were also prepared [227,228], and shown
to present similar properties to those of the original compound,
down to a certain size. All these studies thus allow implementing additional physical properties, to access formulation
tools widely used in soft-matter science, thus reducing greatly
the amount of SCO material necessary to eventually build a

4.2.5. 2D compounds
Although 1,2,4-triazole-based ligands have allowed the isolation of an increasing number of extended coordination networks
(see Section 2 of this review), the number of such compounds
exhibiting SCO remains extremely limited. As mentioned before,
this is due to the fact that the monodentate coordination mode of
the 1,2,4-triazole ring, both through the N1 atom for 4-substituted
ligands, or through the N4 for 1-substituted ones, provides a too
weak ligand ﬁeld and thus produces HS species. Exceptions are
found when a complementary stronger donor group and/or the
participation of the triazole ring in supramolecular interactions (Hbonds) result in the correct adjustment of the overall ligand-ﬁeld
strength around the iron(II) ion. The sole exception reported so
far that has a bidimensional structure is [Fe(L40)2 (NCS)2 ]n ·nH2 O,
which exhibits an abrupt transition with a symmetric 21 K wide
down = 123 K and T up = 144 K, see Fig. 78) [229].
hysteresis (T1/2

Despite its highly cooperative SCO behaviour, thus associated
with a ﬁrst-order transition, the compound remains in the monoclinic C2/c space group over the whole temperature range, as
shown by several detailed structural studies [230,231]. The selenocyanate analogue has also been isolated [232], and presents a
SCO with a narrower 6 K wide hysteresis at higher temperadown = 208 K and T up = 220 K, as expected from the

relatively stronger donor character of NCSe− . The bidimensional
structure arises from N1,N1 -bridges in the bc plane, connecting to each other the equatorial positions of the distorted FeN6
octahedra. Two trans thiocyanate ligands complete the coordination sphere of the iron(II) ion (Fig. 78). These are directed away
from the layers, providing inter-sheet connections through van
der Waals interactions and weak hydrogen bonds with the lattice
water molecules sitting in the voids that are perpendicular to the bc
plane. Most importantly, each water molecule forms two hydrogen
˚ with the free N2 and N2
bonds (O–H···N distances of 3.1 and 3.7 A)
atoms of the L40 ligands, thus affecting the donor strength of the
N1-donating 1,2,4-triazole ligands. The absence of these interactions in the dehydrated compound, while not strongly altering the
structure, results in the disappearance of the SCO [229], therefore
indicating a weaker LF strength. The major structural modiﬁcations
observed upon the SCO, besides the usual shortening of the Fe–N
bond lengths (−0.175 A˚ and −0.213 A˚ for the Fe–NCS and Fe–NL40
bonds, respectively) lies in a reorientation of the NCS− groups,
which results in a more linear Fe–N–C–S geometry and a lower
distortion in the LS state. The HS → LS transition also reduces the
O–H···N contacts [230]. Clearly, both the direct rigid L40 bridges
between the spin-changing iron(II) ions and the hydrogen-bonding
network provide the structural frame with a highly efﬁcient propagation of the local modiﬁcation of the iron(II) coordination sphere,
and thus with the observed highly cooperative SCO behaviour.
Indeed, [Fe(L40)2 (NCS)2 ]n ·nH2 O is considered to be the prime
example of highly cooperative SCO compounds. Hence, the system has been the subject of numerous studies, as well as the basis
for original studies and discoveries. The hysteresis loop has thus
been detected with NMR spectroscopy [232], EPR spectroscopy
through Mn- and Cu-doping experiments [232], or muon relaxation
studies [233]. The effect of metal dilution on the SCO properties
was analyzed in Fe–M (M = Co, Ni, Zn) mixed systems [234,235].
These investigations revealed that the metal dilution smoothes the
transition curve and, depending on the doping metal, shifts the
transition temperatures. Light-induced trapping and relaxation of
the metastable HS state were studied [236], in particular through a
detailed structural analysis of the different accessible states, including the thermally trapped metastable HS state [231,237]. These
studies showed that the thermally and light-induced trapped HS
states were virtually identical, and that the thermal SCO and the
LIESST result in identical structural variations [230]. The effect of a

permanent irradiation in SCO compounds, with the observation of
a Light-Induced Thermal Hysteresis, was ﬁrst studied and modeled
on this remarkable system [236].
Another strategy to create iron(II)-based extended networks
exhibiting SCO properties has been introduced very recently
[238], simply by replacing one of the 2-pyridyl group of L189
by a 4-pyridyl moiety. The resulting ligand L256 still displays
one pyridyl-triazole chelating pocket, and thus affords a potential coordination environment which is similar to that of the
mononuclear SCO compounds described above. In addition, the
remaining 4-pyridine donor group can participate in the gener-

ation of an extended network. So far, only one SCO compound
has been produced applying this strategy. Its 2D structure is
built from [Fe(L256)2 ] building blocks, whose four equatorial sites
are occupied by two trans 3-(pyrid-2-yl)-1,2,4-triazolate chelating
pockets, and the axial positions are occupied by 4-pyridyl N-donor
units from two neighboring building blocks (Fig. 79). Each metal
ion is thus connected to four neighbors, giving rise to squaregrid layers. The layers are organized in a staggered manner and

actions together with the rather rigid network is a cooperative
SCO behaviour, with a 5.4 K hysteresis at temperatures close to

0 ◦ C (T1/2

with the exact same formulation or including solvent guests have
been isolated under very similar solvothermal conditions, although
they all present LS iron(II) ions up to 100 ◦ C. The difference between
these compounds and [Fe(L256)2 ]n lies in a rotation of the axial
3-pyridine donor, which allows the formation of very different
frameworks, e.g. 3D and interpenetrated 3D structures. This synthetic approach is appealing since it may be applied to most
chelating ligands, including those reviewed here that have been
shown to favour SCO behaviour. In addition, thanks to the negatively charged triazolate ligand, the 2D network [Fe(L256)2 ]n is
neutral, and therefore does not rely on the counter anion for its
formation.

4.2.6. 3D compounds
As mentioned previously, L40 is able to bridge iron(II) ions
through its N1 and N1 donor atoms. In the absence of terminal
coordinating anions such as NCS− , a 3D coordination polymer formulated as [Fe(L40)3 ]n (A)2n can be obtained (with A = ClO4 − or
CF3 SO3 − ). Although the CF3 SO3 − compound is a HS system [239],
the ClO4 − one exhibits a complete SCO with two steps at 222 K and
184 K and a plateau corresponding to an intermediate 50% HS population in the range 210–185 K [240]. While the high-temperature
transition is about 30 K wide, the low-temperature one is extremely
abrupt and presents a hysteresis with a width of about 3 K (Fig. 80).
Calorimetric and Mössbauer spectroscopic studies conﬁrmed these
observations, and the structure of the compound was solved in the
HS, LS and intermediate states [240]. Despite the observation of a
very abrupt SCO, indicative of a ﬁrst-order transition, no change
in space group was observed. It was nevertheless shown recently
that the SCO in this compound proceeds through nucleation and
formation of domains coupled to crystallographic modiﬁcations
[241].
The structure of this compound exhibits two Fe crystallographic
sites, which are both surrounded by six N1-donating triazole
rings and are thus connected through bridging N1,N1 -L40 to six
neighbors (see inset in Fig. 80). This arrangement results in a 3D
architecture with channels along the b axis that are occupied by two
crystallographically independent perchlorate ions (Fig. 81, left).
These perchlorate ions form several hydrogen bonds with the C–H
groups of the ligand L40, giving rise to two types of electronic
interactions with the iron(II) ions, either through a Fe–N–CH···O–Cl
moiety or a longer Fe–N–N–CH···O–Cl pathway. The former interaction only concerns the Fe2 site, while both interactions are present
for the Fe1 site. The reason is that the C–H group of L40 which is the
closest to the Fe2 site is involved in an N···H–C hydrogen bond with
the uncoordinated N2 atom of a neighboring triazole ring coordinated to a Fe2 site (see Fig. 81, right). The resulting difference
in donor strength most likely induces the two-step character of
the SCO in [Fe(L40)3 ]n (ClO4 )2n , the Fe2 site being LS in the intermediate phase. It should be noted that although the 1,2,4-triazole

532

extended systems with this azole do show SCO properties, and ditetrazoles ligands are the source of the widest family of 1D, 2D and
3D SCO compounds. SCO tetrazole compounds have been partially
reviewed in 2004 [170,171] and 2007 [172], but many new systems have been reported since then, in particular with the ﬁrst use
of 2-tetrazolyl ligands in SCO chemistry.

rings in [Fe(L40)3 ]n (ClO4 )2n are N1-monodentate, they all participate to several hydrogen-bonding interactions. Without these
hydrogen bonds, which evidently affect the donor strength of the
N1-monodentate 1,2,4-triazole, the conditions would not favour
the occurrence of SCO, as is actually observed in most compounds
with terminal N1-donating 1,2,4-triazole ligands. For instance, the
fact that the triﬂate analogue is a HS compound may be ascribed
to the absence of such hydrogen-bonding contacts in the crystal lattice [239]. The very abrupt low-temperature transition can
also be explained by structural modiﬁcations; indeed, while the
cell-volume decrease is similar to that observed for the hightemperature step (ca. 3%, mostly along the c axis), the dihedral
angle between the two triazole moieties of the ligand L40 suffers
a dramatic increase to a value close to 90◦ , as observed for the free
ligand. Such reorientation of the triazole ring is obviously efﬁciently
propagated through the network of hydrogen bonds involving the
perchlorate ions, thus resulting in a very cooperative SCO for the
Fe1 site.
4.3. Tetrazole compounds
Of the three azole rings considered in the present review, the
mono-donating tetrazole (Fig. 82) is probably the weakest donor;
indeed, SCO properties in complexes containing tetrazole ligands
have been observed mostly in the 60–200 K range. Although tetrazole has many bridging coordination modes (see Scheme 7), in all
reported SCO compounds it acts as a monodentate ligand through
its N4 donor atom. The most common type of tetrazole ligands are
1-substituted tetrazoles, although several recent reports [242–244]
have shown that 2-substituted tetrazole ligands may be used
as well to prepare SCO compounds. Apart from the later compounds, all tetrazole-based SCO compounds contain a common
[Fe(tetrazole)6 ] octahedral moiety. As demonstrated in section 2,
ligands bearing two tetrazole rings separated by a linker are potential candidates for the design of extended coordination networks
with SCO properties. Indeed, and in contrast to 1,2,4-triazoles, most

4.3.1. Monomers
Since the ﬁrst report by Franke in 1979 [245], many homoleptic hexatetrazole iron(II) compounds with a range of anions
have been synthesized, mostly with 1-alkyltetrazoles or 1halogenoalkyltetrazoles. They all possess SCO properties and
basically exhibit the same complex core with six monodentate
tetrazole N-donors forming an octahedral coordination sphere. A
complete list of all materials of this type known to date is given
in Table 5. Surprisingly, the simplest analogue complex with 1Htetrazole (HL103) has not been reported so far. Although, the
complexes themselves are similar, the SCO properties in this class of
compounds may be of almost any type. Thermal transitions ranging from gradual to abrupt, with hysteresis, complete, involving
only a fraction of the iron(II) centers or occurring in two steps
(with similar or different abruptness) can be found. This wide
spectrum of properties is strongly related to crystal-structure features, including crystallographic transitions, packing aspects as
well as thermal history. The transition temperatures are inﬂuenced
by both the anion and the tetrazole substituent. These temperatures remain quite low overall; for instance, the family with
1-alkyltetrazoles has a T1/2 lying in the range 69–207 K. This family of compounds has been extensively investigated, in part as the
basis of many innovative studies related to light-induced effects in
SCO compounds, as well as theoretical modeling of the SCO phenomenon. Several reviews cover these speciﬁc aspects in detail
[164,246]. In addition, a recent review on mononuclear SCO compounds with N-donor ligands includes most of these compounds
and discusses in detail those with peculiar structural or physical
features [172]. Since then, there has been only one new very similar SCO system reported, using as ligand 1-cycloalkyltetrazoles
(L271–L273) [247,248]. Therefore, only one illustrative example,
i.e. [Fe(L258)6 ](BF4 )2 , will be described in detail, and the reader
is referred to the complete list shown in Table 5, and to previous
reviews [171,172,249].
The high-spin crystalline form of [Fe(L258)6 ](BF4 )2 crystallizes
in the rhombohedric space group R-3. Its solid-state structure is
shown in Fig. 83; the complex is centered on a special position
with 1/3 occupancy, all ligands being thus identical. The tetraﬂuoroborate ions are lying on the threefold axis and form together

ing complexes. Consequently, all complexes within the layers are
connected. If the crystals are cooled sufﬁciently fast, a reversible
abrupt SCO without hysteresis is detected (T1/2 = 125 K), and the
structure of the LS phase is comparable to that of the HS phase,
with no lowering of symmetry or superstructure. In fact, the main
differences are the typical decrease of the Fe–N bond lengths with

cooling, a broadening and splitting of the single-crystal diffraction
peaks occur simultaneously with the SCO. Although this event has
been interpreted as a structural transition, the LS phase obtained
by slow cooling is better described as a disordered phase with poor

crystallinity. Interestingly, upon warming above 135 K, the HS crystalline phase is restored, the whole process being fully reversible,
and the crystals are apparently not damaged. The spin transition
in [Fe(L258)6 ](BF4 )2 is thus not triggered by the structural phase
change, but rather induces it if the compound is maintained in the
SCO temperature range long enough. This is further conﬁrmed by
the fact that the R-3 LS phase can be converted to the “disorder”
LS phase by annealing above 120 K. The abruptness of the SCO is
reasonably ascribed to the network of hydrogen bonds connecting the spin-changing centers within layers perpendicular to the
c axis. Doping studies with zinc(II) showed that the diluted compounds present a similar behaviour down to an iron(II) content of
44%. Below this concentration, the transition only takes place in the
ordered phase, and becomes more gradual (see Fig. 83, bottom).
Despite its intricate behaviour, [Fe(L258)6 ](BF4 )2 is one of
the most studied and better characterized SCO compounds
[245,249–259], in part because it has served as an model SCO material in the discovery and the physical interpretation of spin-state
trapping (LIESST and reverse-LIESST effects), and their relaxation
[164,246]. It has also often been used to develop new physical
techniques for the detection of the SCO phenomenon (see Table 5).
More recently, the ﬁrst spin-density map of a SCO compound was
obtained using this compound, by single-crystal polarized neutron
diffraction [260], and an optical hysteresis in the rates of laser-

induced interconversion of HS and LS states was demonstrated
[261].
All these (now) classical SCO complexes are based on tetrazole ligands substituted on the nitrogen N1 atom. Lately, a series
of tetrazole ligands substituted on their carbon atom by a 1,10phenantroline and alkylated on their N2 atom, namely the ligands
HL274-L283, were used as asymmetric terdentate ligands to produce a series of complexes with iron(II) tetraﬂuoroborate and
perchlorate [262]. These compounds exhibit structural features
analogous to those of complexes obtained from 2-(1,2,4-triazol3-yl)-1,10-phenanthroline ligands (HL233-L236). A view of the
neutral complex obtained with the non-alkylated and deprotonated ligand L274− is depicted in Fig. 84. This coordination
compound displays a mer conformation, as all complexes of this
series. This complex presents an abrupt SCO with a 4 K wide hysdown = 252 K and T up = 256 K.

The whole series of compounds, including various solvates
(S = H2 O or MeOH), exhibit SCO properties at relatively high
temperatures, as a result of the stronger donor character of 1,10phenanthroline. Details on the speciﬁc SCO features of structurally
characterized compounds, ranging from abrupt to gradual (and in
some cases with two-step transitions), are collected in Table 5. For
instance, the hydrated BF4 − salt of the complex with a pentyl substituent on the tetrazole ring (L279) has a very abrupt and reversible

interaction between the nearly planar chelating aromatic rings of
neighboring complexes. These rings are nearly perpendicular to
each other within each complex; however, the different embrace
motifs proposed by Dance[263] to describe such ␲–␲ interactions
are observed in the present series of complexes, with offset faceto-face, edge-to-face and/or parallel four-fold aryl embrace modes
(see Fig. 85 for an example). With longer alkyl tails on the tetrazole ring, the packing of these chains becomes a second dominating

(L283), the situation is signiﬁcantly different. The ClO4 − and BF4 −
complexes, whose cation is shown in Fig. 85, present strikingly
distinct behaviours. Indeed, the SCO curve of the perchlorate salt

ca. 262 K. The observation of such SCO disparities in closely related
compounds has been ascribed to different intermolecular interactions and molecular-packing arrangements in the corresponding
solid-state structures. The most inﬂuential factor is likely to be the

SCO liquid-crystalline materials. The highly interesting properties
of this series of compounds, described in one sole dense report
[262], deserve further studies.
4.3.2. 1D compounds
A number of di(tetrazol-1-yl)alkane ligands as well as a similar
ligand with a xylylene spacer (L126–L291, see Fig. 82) have been
used in conjunction with simple iron(II) salts to form extended networks (most of them showing SCO properties), which are listed
in Table 5. The largest group in this family of compounds is that
made of linear chains formed through the bridging of iron(II) ions
by three di-tetrazol-1-yl ligands, coordinated through their N4,N4
donor atoms. The anions are located in the hollow spaces generated
by the packing of the chains. Indeed, except with 1,4-di(tetrazol-1yl)butane (L131) that forms interlocked 3D structures (see below),
all ␣,␻-di(tetrazol-1-yl)alkane ligands used so far (with BF4 − and
ClO4 − salts) have yielded such 1D compounds, although only the
crystal structure of [Fe(L126)3 ]n (BF4 )2n has been reported [264].
All these compounds exhibit a gradual SCO with T1/2 in the range
125–170 K. A recent paper compiles information on these systems,
discussing the inﬂuence of the spacer length and the anion on the
SCO characteristics [265]. A similar 1D compound was obtained
from 1,2-di(tetrazol-1-yl)propane (L290) and ClO4 − . This material
also showed a gradual SCO centered at 190 K. This compound was
in fact the ﬁrst structurally characterized SCO iron(II) chain compound [266]. The absence of cooperativity in the SCO properties
of these compounds, in which the iron(II) centers are connected
covalently, has been ascribed to the ﬂexible character of the spacer,
able to absorb the local changes induced by the transition, instead
of propagating them. In this respect, the use of a bulkier spacer
in 1,2-di(tetrazol-1-yl)-2-methyl-propane (L128) has resulted in a
drastic effect. The structure of [Fe(␮-L128)2 (L128)]n (ClO4 )2n also
presents 1D coordination chains, but the neighboring iron(II) ions
are bridged by only two L128 ligands, the remaining coordination
position being occupied by terminal monocoordinating trans-L128
ligands (Fig. 86) [267]. With respect to the triply-bridged systems,

rate anions are involved in anion–␲ interactions with the tetrazole
rings in [Fe(␮-L128)2 (L128)]n (ClO4 )2n , probably thanks to the rel-

535

atively longer inter-chain separations. These perchlorate ions are
disordered at high temperature (HS state), and the “opening” of the
tetrazole rings upon the SCO, e.g. the increase of the centroid–N–Fe
angle, induces an ordering of the perchlorate, probably as a result
of the strengthening of the anion–␲ interactions. These structural
modiﬁcations are most likely involved in the observation of an
abrupt SCO with a 3 K wide hysteresis (with T1/2 down = 133 K and
T1/2 up = 136 K) for this compound (Fig. 86). This behaviour is indeed
unique among the 1D tetrazole-based compounds reported so far,
and indicates that the use of other spacers in di-(tetrazol-1-yl) ligands, for example chosen among those developed for MOFs (see
Section 2), should provide new and potentially interesting materials.
This is the case for the recently reported 1D SCO system
with the comparatively more rigid m-xylylen-di(tetrazole-N1)
bridging ligand, L291 [27]. Three similar compounds with formula [Fe(L291)3 ]n A2n ·solvent have been isolated, with A = PF6 −
in methanol, and with A = CF3 SO3 − and ClO4 − in acetonitrile.
The structures, determined for the PF6 − and CF3 SO3 − derivatives,
exhibit coordination chains resulting from the bridging of octahedrally surrounded iron(II) ions through three L291 ligands. The
bent conformation of the three xylylene spacers results in the formation of cages along the chain, that are occupied by methanol
or acetonitrile molecules for the PF6 − and CF3 SO3 − compounds,
respectively (Fig. 87). In the former, the PF6 − anions are lying in
the space between the chains in the same plane as the crystallographically unique Fe atom, and interact through anion–␲ contacts
with three different chains. The compound displays a rather gradual
SCO centered at 150 K (Fig. 87 bottom), which induces insigniﬁcant structural modiﬁcations of the P63/m arrangement, except the
usual Fe–N bond length variations. The structure of the CF3 SO3 −
compound is similar at high temperatures; however, at 170 K
it experiences a transition to the trigonal P-3 space group that
generates two different chains having C3 and S6 symmetry, respec-

tively, each containing two crystallographic Fe sites. The compound
exhibits a gradual SCO at T1/2 = 110 K, corresponding to only half
of the iron(II) ions (Fig. 87 bottom). Indeed, the low-temperature
structure indicates that within each type of chain, only one of
the two Fe sites has Fe–N bond lengths characteristic of a LS
state. It is thus the ﬁrst SCO chain exhibiting the alternating ···HSLS-HS··· pattern. The ClO4 − compound has a very partial SCO at
even lower temperatures, but since its crystal structure could not
be determined, these differences could not be rationalized. However, on basis of the [Fe(L291)3 ]n (CF3 SO3 )2n ·nMeCN system, the
authors were able to discuss for the ﬁrst time the effect of the
anion on the SCO properties of 1D tetrazole-based compounds
[27].
The recent design and use of a ditopic ligand bearing
two different tetrazole units, i.e. 2-hydroxy-1-(tetrazol-1-yl)-3(tetrazol-2-yl)propane, with iron(II), yield an even more interesting
material. In the single-crystal X-ray structure of the resulting
compound, [Fe(HL176)2 (MeCN)2 ]n (ClO4 )n ·2nMeCN, both tetrazole
rings of the HL176 ligand are coordinated to an iron(II) ion
through their N4 atom. These double connections along the c
axis to two neighboring iron(II) ions generates a 1D chain compound (Fig. 88) [243]. The coordination sphere of the iron(II)
ions is completed by two trans acetonitrile molecules. The perchlorate ions are involved in hydrogen-bonding interactions
with the alcohol groups of HL176. A gradual SCO, centered at
ca. 110 K, is detected for this compound, hence making it the
ﬁrst tetrazole-based iron(II) SCO compound whose iron(II) coordination environment is not composed of six tetrazole rings.
[Fe(HL176)2 (MeCN)2 ]n (ClO4 )n ·2nMeCN is also the ﬁrst SCO compound from a tetrazole ligand substituted at the N2 position, in
contrast to the widely-used 1-substituted tetrazoles. The present
system together with the recently reported [268] compounds
obtained from N-(␻-bromoalkyl)tetrazoles, ␣-(pyridylazoly)-␻(tetrazolyl)alkanes, ␣-(tetrazolyl)-␻-(1,2,3-triazolyl)alkanes and
␣-(tetrazol-1-yl)-␻-(tetrazol-2-yl)alkanes are particularly appealing, and a great future can safely be predicted for tetrazole-based
SCO research.
4.3.3. 2D compounds
The ﬁrst 2D extended network based on a tetrazole ligand that
exhibits SCO properties is [Fe(L292)2 ]n (A)2n (with A = BF4 − and
ClO4 − ). The iron(II) ions of this compound are bridged through the
tri-connecting tri(2-(tetrazol-1-yl)ethyl)amine ligand L292, producing a 2D grid. The compounds have a complete and abrupt SCO
with a 9 K wide hysteresis (T1/2 down = 167 and 157 K and T1/2 up = 176
and 168 K, respectively). These complexes were ﬁrst reported in a
conference proceedings [269], and so far no further studies on this
interesting system have been described in the literature.
With
di-(tetrazol-yl)
ligands,

2D
SCO
compound
has
been
isolated
to
date,
namely
[Fe(HL293)1.8 (L294)1.2 ]n (BF4 )0.8n ·nMeOH·0.8nH2 O [270]. The
formation of the 2D structure appears to arise from an in situ
reaction between HL293 and tetraﬂuoroborate ions, yielding the

[Fe(HL293)1.8 (L294)1.2 ]n (BF4 )0.8n ·nMeOH·0.8nH2 O [270]. The [BF3 O] moiety pertaining to the negatively charged L294− ligand, formed in-situ by reaction of the

mode for clarity.

charged ligand L294− . The iron(II) ions are connected by double
disordered HL293/L294− bridges in the c direction, and by only
one HL293 bridge in the b direction, thus creating grids that are
perpendicular to the a axis (Fig. 89). The remaining BF4 − anions
as well as the lattice solvent molecules occupy the voids along
this axis. Despite its striking structure, this compound presents a
gradual SCO, centered at 112 K. As for most SCO tetrazole-based
compounds, the LIESST effect is operative here, and studies of the
HS → LS relaxation revealed an exponential behaviour, typical for
non-cooperative SCO systems [270].
Subsequently to previous reports on copper(II) and zinc(II)
extended coordination networks with di-(tetrazol-2-yl) ligands
[271–273], two 2D iron(II) compounds were very recently obtained
by reaction of 1,6-di(tetrazol-2-yl)hexane (L295) with Fe(ClO4 )2
in either acetonitrile or ethanol. The resulting compounds
[Fe(L295)2 (MeCN)2 ]n (ClO4 )2n and [Fe(L295)2 (EtOH)2 ]n (ClO4 )2n
are isostructural and present 2D grids of iron(II) centers connected
to four neighbors by single L295 N4,N4’ bridges [242]. Similarly to
[Fe(HL176)2 (MeCN)2 ]n (ClO4 )n ·2nMeCN, the coordination sphere
of the iron(II) ions is completed by two trans acetonitrile or
ethanol molecules (Fig. 90). The perchlorate ions are disordered
and are located between the layers where they weakly interact

with C–H groups of L295. As expected from the presence of weak
alcoholic donor ligands, [Fe(L295)2 (EtOH)2 ]n (ClO4 )2n remains HS.
In contrast, the acetonitrile analogue does exhibit a rather abrupt
SCO at T1/2 = 128 K. This compound represents the second example
of SCO system based on 2-substituted tetrazole ligands, therefore
conﬁrming that such ligands are suitable for the preparation of
SCO materials.
4.3.4. 3D compounds
Among the ␣,␻-di-(tetrazol-1-yl)alkane ligands, 1,4-di(tetrazole-1-yl)butane (L131) appears to possess the ideal
combination of length and spacer ﬂexibility to favor the formation
of 3D structures instead of the 1D structures usually generated
with these ligands (see above). Indeed, although the anions could
not be located, [Fe(L131)3 ]n (ClO4 )2n represents the ﬁrst SCO compound with a catenane structure consisting of three interlocked
3D networks [274]. The PF6 − and BF4 − analogue compounds were
later reported and the interlocked 3D structures conﬁrmed (see
Fig. 91) [275,276]. By comparison with the 1D systems, it appears
that the ability of L131 to adopt an anti conformation (rather
than the bent syn one) is responsible for the formation of a 3D
network. Indeed, in the PF6 − derivative, the highly symmetric
structure exhibits identical anti L131 bridges [275]. The PF6 −
anion, whose size matches the cavities of the 3D network, seems
to be an additional favorable factor through its probable role as
a template. In contrast, in the BF4 − derivative, the symmetry is
highly reduced, with three different butylene spacers, i.e. one
trans, one syn and one disordered over two positions [276]. The
corresponding contraction of two of the butylene chains is ascribed
to the smaller size of the BF4 − anion. Besides this difference, the
two compounds have very similar structural characteristics,
with small voids arranged along the c axis and containing small
amounts of disordered solvent molecules (at most half a MeOH
molecule in the PF6 − compound). As often with SCO compounds,
this small solvent content, in particular its nature, has a drastic effect on the SCO properties of these materials (see Fig. 91,
bottom).
The SCO behaviour of the ClO4 − compound was ﬁrst measured
on dried microcrystals grown from an ethanolic solution. An abrupt
SCO with a 20 K wide hysteresis was observed (T1/2 down = 150 K
and T1/2 up = 170 K) [274]. However, this cooperative transition
corresponds only to about 16% of the iron centers. Subsequent
measurements on a dried powder revealed a two-step SCO with
T1/2 1 = 134 K and T1/2 2 = 84 K [277]. The PF6 − compound, if obtained
without methanol or in a methanol/chloroform mixture, exhibits
a SCO with two abrupt steps, the low-temperature one presenting a hysteresis of 4 K (T1/2 1 = 180 K, T1/2 2down = 168 K and
T1/2 2up = 172 K). When isolated from ethanol, the SCO is similar but
is shifted towards a lower temperature by 7 K. Moreover, it does
not display a hysteretic behaviour anymore in the low-temperature
step (T1/2 1 = 173 K, T1/2 2 = 161 K) [278]. The solvent contents of the
respective polycrystalline materials have been evaluated to 0.075
and 0.25 molecules per Fe ion, respectively for MeOH and EtOH
[278]. Similarly, the BF4 − derivative can be obtained from a pure
ethanol solution or from a 95:5 ethanol:water mixture. Although
both samples present a SCO of only 50% of the iron content, the
former has a gradual SCO curve centered at 84 K, while the latter
presents abrupt transitions with an asymmetric hysteresis with a
width of 9 K (T1/2 down = 80 K, T1/2 up = 89 K) [276]. Such sensitivity
to even tiny amounts of lattice solvent molecules is apparently
enhanced in the present systems through their involvement in
intricate interlocked structure.
As already demonstrated with 1D and 2D SCO compounds,
tetrazol-2-yl ligands favour the conditions to generate SCO materials. In the case of [Fe(L130)3 ]n (ClO4 )2n , which is obtained from
1,3-di(tetrazol-2-yl)propane (L130) either as the di-ethanol sol-

vate or the unsolvated product, the coordination sphere of the
iron(II) centers is solely built from N4-donating tetrazole ligands
[244], contrary to the 1D and 2D compounds that included two
coordinated acetonitrile molecules. The L130 ligands thus connect each iron(II) ion, through its N4,N4 donor atoms, to six
neighbors generating a regular non-interpenetrated 3D network.
The perchlorate ions as well as the ethanol lattice molecules
located in the voids of the structure only weakly interact with
the tetrazole rings. While the unsolvated compound remains
HS, the ethanol solvate exhibits a gradual SCO centered at
145 K. The observed residual HS fraction of ca. 20% has been
tentatively ascribed to a partial loss of solvent and/or partial oxidation. [Fe(L130)3 ]n (ClO4 )2n is the ﬁrst 3D compound based on
tetrazol-2-yl donor groups. Considering the similarity of this R3
structure with its zinc(II) analogue [272], one can reasonably expect
that new iron(II) compounds with related ligands will be pro-

derived from these heteroarenes are reported weekly in the literature. The facile access to this family of ligands actually stimulates
the imagination and creativity of research scientists who are building up beautiful and increasingly intricate azole-based molecules.
With the present review, we hope that we will encourage even
more researchers to use these fascinating small aromatic rings to
generate great new metal-organic architectures with original properties.

duced, on the basis of known zinc(II) or copper(II) compounds
[271–273].
Another potential source of new SCO materials may arise from
the use of mixed ligands, such as HL183 which possesses a carboxylic group connected to a tetrazol-1-yl ring by means of a
methylene spacer. Such ligand may form Fe(tetrazole)6 coordination units with SCO properties, and at the same time coordinate
other metals through its carboxylic moiety.
This
has
now
been
demonstrated
in
[(Fe3 O)Fe(HL183)6 (H2 O)3 ]n (ClO4 )2n (NO3 )n [279], whose octahedral FeN6 part and prismatic oxo-centered [Fe3 ] unit are
connected through the ligand L183− to build a 3D NiAs-type
framework (Fig. 92). The iron(II) site surrounded by six tetrazole
N4-donors clearly exhibits a SCO behaviour, with the Fe–N bond
lengths shortening from the HS (ca. 2.20 A˚ at 330 K) to the LS state
(ca. 2.01 A˚ at 90 K). The analysis of the spin transition by magnetic
measurements is difﬁcult due to the presence of antiferromagnetic
interactions within the [Fe3 ] moiety. However, it can be described
as gradual and occurring between 125 and 175 K. The application
of pressure to the system results in shifts of the SCO, up to 330 K
for the highest pressure. This last example, based on a ditopic
bridging ligand typically found in MOF chemistry, clearly leaves
much room for further development of SCO chemistry.
5. Conclusions
The high versatility of the 1,2,3-triazole, 1,2,4-triazole and
tetrazole rings for the design and construction of remarkable coordination materials with attractive physicochemical properties has
been clearly demonstrated in the present review. The straightforward preparation of such azole-containing ligands together with
their synthetic ﬂexibility has allowed the creation of a myriad
of outstanding systems. We have restricted our review to the
utilization of these azoles for the preparation of coordination polymers and MOFs, metal complexes, and coordination compounds
with spin-crossover properties. These areas of chemistry research
indeed represent current hot topics of investigation. However,
these N-donor ligands have found applications in many other
ﬁelds of applied coordination chemistry, such as biological chemistry, nanomaterials, anion recognition, and nonlinear optics. Thus,
many research groups are engaged in the design, preparation and
study of the coordination chemistry of 1,2,3-triazole-1,2,4-triazoleand tetrazole-based ligands. For instance, (poly)metallic complexes
