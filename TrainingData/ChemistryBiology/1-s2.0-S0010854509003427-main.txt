Redox-active self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) provide an excellent platform for investigating electron
transfer kinetics. Using a well-deﬁned bridge, a redox center can be positioned at a ﬁxed distance from
the electrode and electron transfer kinetics probed using a variety of electrochemical techniques. Cyclic
voltammetry, AC voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and chronoamperometry are
most commonly used to determine the rate of electron transfer of redox-activated SAMs. A variety of redox
species have been attached to SAMs, and include transition metal complexes (e.g., ferrocene, ruthenium
pentaammine, osmium bisbipyridine, metal clusters) and organic molecules (e.g., galvinol, C60 ). SAMs
offer an ideal environment to study the outer-sphere interactions of redox species. The composition and
integrity of the monolayer and the electrode material inﬂuence the electron transfer kinetics and can
be investigated using electrochemical methods. Theoretical models have been developed for investigating SAM structure. This review discusses methods and monolayer compositions for electrochemical
measurements of redox-active SAMs.

1. Introduction
Electron transfer has been extensively studied in the context of
biological processes, sensors, artiﬁcial photosynthesis, and molecular electronics [1–23]. Marcus theory predicts that the rate of
electron transfer between a donor and an acceptor is dependent
on the Gibbs free energy ( G), reorganization energy ( ), temperature (T) and the electronic coupling between a electron donor and
acceptor (HAB ) [24]. A signiﬁcant body of work has been reported
that examines each of these variables in the context of long-range
biological electron transfer, molecular systems including artiﬁ-

cial photosynthetic centers, highly conjugated molecular wires,
and mixed valence systems [6–8,10,21,25–34]. Focus on electron
transfer kinetics has greatly increased in the ﬁeld of molecular electronics (rectiﬁers, junctions, switches, transistors, sensors, etc.), to
delineate electron transport between electrodes through molecular bridges [3,6,20,35,36].
Recent interest in surface (electrode) modiﬁcation has led to
the study of electron transfer using electrodes modiﬁed with
self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) [1,37–43]. SAMs provide an
excellent platform for exploiting electrochemistry to study electron transfer processes because each variable ( G, HAB , , T) can

be controlled experimentally. For example, SAMs allow doublelayer effects to be controlled and eliminate problems associated
with diffusive mass transport. Redox-modiﬁed SAMs have been
designed to systematically study the correlation of G, , and
HAB to SAM components. These components include the distance between the redox center and the electrode, the molecular
environment of the redox center, and bridge structure (Fig. 1.1)
[1,44,45].
A variety of electrochemical techniques are used to probe each
of these electron transfer variables. The bridge controls the distance and coupling between the redox center and the electrode.
Reorganization energy can be probed by changing the molecular
environment of the redox center by using a variety of solvents or
by changing the SAM composition. The effects of changing each of
these variables can be quantiﬁed using electrochemical techniques.
SAMs are ideal systems for using electrochemistry to study
long-range electron transfer events on electrodes. However, the
multitude of electrochemical techniques available (and subsequent data analysis) can be daunting to novices of the ﬁeld.
In this review, we describe the most commonly used electrochemical methods to measure kET , , HAB using redox-modiﬁed
SAM systems. These analytical methods include cyclic voltammetry, AC voltammetry, chronoamperometry, and electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy. Each of these methods has advantages
and limitations that will be described in Section 2. Further, a
detailed description of data analysis for each of these techniques
will be described. Table 1.1 lists kET of ferrocene alkane thiols in
SAMs for various lengths of the alkane bridge and the method of
determining kET is listed for comparison.
We review additional aspects of SAM electrochemistry that are
critical to acquiring reliable and accurate ET measurements. The

fundamental properties of redox-active molecules are discussed
in terms of SAM applicability. The formation and characterization
of the SAM structure is discussed, along with the variety of compositions of bridges connecting the electrode and redox centers.
The qualities of various electrode materials are described and we
include a summary of computational approaches to modeling of
SAMs.
2. Electrochemical methods
There are four electrochemical techniques typically used for
determining kET in redox-active SAMs; cyclic voltammetry (CV),
chronoamperometry (CA), alternating current voltammetry (ACV),
and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). In this section
we describe the basic theory behind each method and outline
the advantages and disadvantages of each approach. Methods
used to a lesser extent such as indirect laser-induced temperature
jump (ILIT) and scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) are
included.
2.1. Cyclic voltammetry (CV)
The most widely recognized electrochemical technique, cyclic
voltammetry (CV) is a potential sweep method where the potential is varied and the current is measured of a redox event [46–50].
CV does not require expensive or highly sophisticated instrumentation, and is therefore widely available. This method is less sensitive
to kinetic heterogeneity than other electrochemical techniques.
Kinetic heterogeneity is a distribution of electron transfer rates
due to variations in the molecular environment of the redox center

mal potential of the complex.1 For each scan rate, ks (Á), the rate
constant for electron transfer at a particular overpotential, can be
determined from Eq. (2.5). A plot of Á vs. log ks (Á) is known as a
Tafel plot and importantly, can be used to determine kET [38,53].
Fitting this plot using the Marcus density of states model will be
discussed in Section 2.3.

caused by SAM defects. Using the mathematical models described
below, CV can be used to determine kET , , and HAB .
A wealth of information can be obtained from a cyclic
voltammogram that can be used to evaluate ET of monolayer
surface-bound electroactive species (Fig. 2.1). The background and
peak currents, and the peak potentials are of importance in determining the rate constant of electron transfer reactions. The integrity
of the monolayer is important because disorder can cause a dispersion of measured rate constants. For the measurement of kET , the
redox centers should ideally be isolated from one another and local
molecular environments homogeneous. Fig. 2.1 shows the relevant
parameters that can be determined from CV data.
The background current (charging or capacitive current, ich ) can
be correlated to the thickness of the SAM (Fig. 2.1). The doublelayer capacitance, CDL , is often normalized to the surface area, ASUR ,
for comparison. The effects of disorder in the monolayer on the
capacitance will be discussed further in Section 5.2.

The faradaic current (ip , Fig. 2.1) is directly proportional to the
scan rate, , as described by Eq. (2.2) [46]. The surface coverage, ,

often compared to a theoretical maximum based on the molecular

The peak shape is diagnostic of the homogeneity of the monolayer and can be evaluated by the full width at half of the peak
maximum height (FWHM, Fig. 2.1) as described by Eq. (2.3). Values of FWHM that are larger or smaller than theoretical FWHM
have been attributed to electrostatic effects incurred by neighboring charged species [46,51,52].

Experimentally, an initial potential is chosen such that the oxidation state of the redox centers remains unchanged at the onset
of a scan. The potential is scanned past the formal potential E0 to a
point at which the current returns to baseline. The direction of the
scan is then reversed and returned to the initial starting potential.
In subsequent experiments, the scan rate is varied to give a range
Á values that can be used to determine kET .
In summary, ideal reversible electrochemical behavior results
when both the reduced and oxidized form of the redox species are
strongly adsorbed to the electrode. The CV shows: (1) symmetric peaks, (2) a linear relationship between the peak current and
scan rate, and (3) Ep equal to 0 at low scan rates for a completely
reversible system. For example, the peak shape for a one-electron
process, described by the FWHM, should be 90.6 mV at 25 ◦ C (Eq.
(2.3)) [46].
2.2. Laviron method for the determination of kET
In 1979 Laviron published the mathematical treatment for using
linear sweep voltammetry to determine kET of species adsorbed
to an electrode [54]. The method is based on the Butler–Volmer
approach, and the only experimental data required to use this
method are overpotentials (Eq. (2.4)).
The Laviron method is widely used for determining the electron
transfer rate constant, however, it is subject to a number of constraints that limit its application [54]. First, this method relies on
˛, the transfer coefﬁcient, which is a measure of the symmetry of
the energy barrier of the redox reaction. Ideally, ˛ = 0.5 for all overpotentials, however in many cases ˛ deviates from 0.5. Therefore,
determination of ˛ is crucial to ﬁnding kET . To determine ˛, the peak
potential Ep is plotted vs. log [54]. Epa and Epc are plotted separately in this way to give two branches. At higher scan rates where
Á > 100 mV, the data should be a straight line where the slope of the
line is given in Eq. (2.6).
slope = −

The kET can be determined by applying the constraint of Á = 0 to
Eq. (2.7) which reduces to Eq. (2.8). Determining the x-intercepts of
the lines for the anodic and the cathodic branches provides a and
c , respectively, values that are used in Eq. (2.8) to determine kET .

The redox potential,
anodic and cathodic peak potentials, Epa and Epc , and the peak separation, Ep , is calculated by Epa − Epc . As scan rate increases, peak
separation increases. At slow scan rates the peak separation is 0
because the redox center is adsorbed onto the electrode and diffusion does not play a role [46].
The amount of charge, Q, that is passed can be determined
by integrating the background-subtracted peaks as shown by the
shaded area in Fig. 2.1. The overpotential, Á, is deﬁned according to
Eq. (2.4) as the difference between peak potential Ep and the for-

The term overpotential is sometimes used to refer to the difference in applied
potential and the formal potential of the redox species, as in chronoamperometry. In
electrochemical texts, overpotential may refer to the amount by which an activation
energy is lowered for a process at an electrode surface. This overpotential decreases
the energy barrier that must be overcome and increases the rate of electron transfer.

2.3. Marcus density of states theory for the determination of kET
The rate constant of nonadiabatic (weakly coupled) electron
transfer between an electron donor A and acceptor B in solution
is described by the Marcus semiclassical expression of Eq. (2.9).
Marcus theory is based on a continuum description of the solvent
contribution to the activation energy of ET reactions [55,58–61].
Free energy curves for electron transfer are shown in Fig. 2.2. Constants in the equation are h (Planck’s constant), R (the ideal gas
constant), and kB (Boltzmann’s constant). HAB is the electronic coupling between A and B, is the reorganization energy, and T is
temperature. Numerous electron transfer studies have focused on
probing electronic coupling by varying the length and the nature
of the bridge between the donor and the acceptor (covalent, conjugated, hydrogen bonds, “through space”) [1,3,42,45,56,57].

For redox processes at an electrode, a parameterization of the
potential dependence of electrochemical rates is shown in Eqs.
(2.11) and (2.12). In these equations , ε0 , e0 , A, kB , Á, and T are,
respectively, the reorganization energy, static dielectric constant,
charge of an electron, preexponential factor, Boltzmann constant,
the applied overpotential, and temperature. These are the classical
Butler–Volmer equations wherein the activation energies for both
the cathodic and anodic rates are assumed to be a linear function
of Á and a transfer coefﬁcient is assumed to be 0.5 [46,68].

At high overpotentials, second order terms of the potential
dependence on electrochemical rate constants become signiﬁcant
and Eqs. (2.11) and (2.12) are no longer valid [68]. Moreover,
Butler–Volmer theory does not consider a parabolic reaction surface as is the case in Marcus theory. By approximating the reaction
surface as parabolic, the electrochemical analog of the Marcus
inverted region can be observed [69,70]. These Marcus rate relations are shown in Eqs. (2.13) and (2.14).

Reorganization energy is the energy required to reorient all
atoms (from equilibrium state to the product state) and consists of
two parts: = i + o . The “inner” contribution i relates the energy
required to change bond distances and, in some cases, spin state.
The “outer” contribution o relates the energy needed to reorient
the solvent and is given by Eq. (2.10). This equation uses a simple
geometric assumption that the donor and acceptor are spherical
bodies and treats the solvent as a dielectric continuum [58–61].
The variables rA and rB , are the radii of the redox centers A and B,
d is the distance between the redox centers, and εop and εs are the
optical and static dielectric constants of the solvent, respectively.
Determining Marcus’s “inverted region” using Eq. (2.9) for the conditions at which − G = and the electron transfer rate constant
reaches a maximum, is the most experimentally studied role of
reorganization energy [19,62–67].

The parabolic potential included in Marcus theory is approximated by a linear function as in the Butler–Volmer approach when

(2.14) reduce to Eqs. (2.11) and (2.12).
Cathodic and anodic rate constants for electron transfer
between a redox-active molecule and a metal electrode can be calculated by numerical integration of donor and acceptor levels over
a range of energies ε, the energy level relative to the Fermi energy
level of a metal [1]. Here, we consider only the cathodic expression for the rate constant since the anodic rate constant expression
differs from the cathodic expression only in symmetry.

The Fermi function f(ε) of the metal is the probability that a given
available electron energy state will be occupied at a given temperature [71]. The density of states of the metal (ε) varies slowly near
the Fermi level and is assumed constant over the range of energies used to evaluate the integral [68]. The distribution of electron
acceptor levels of the redox center is represented by a Gaussian
function Dox (ε) whose widths are deﬁned as the reorganization
energy. The preintegral factor, A, includes factors such as electronic
coupling, the probability of tunneling through an electronic barrier
and surface coverage of redox-active sites [72].
If is similar in magnitude to the applied potential, a plateau
region becomes apparent where increasing Á no longer increases
the rate (for example, the 0.2–1.0 eV curves in Fig. 2.3). Eqs. (2.15)
and (2.16) predict that as Á approaches (the advent of the inverted

region) the rate constants will not continue to increase exponentially as predicted by Butler–Volmer equations, but will reach a
maximum when Á = ± [68].
When the Á
, the entire distribution of redox-active sites
overlaps with states in the electrode that are available for electron transfer [68]. Increasing the driving force (and hence Á)
does not make new states available for electron transfer and
does not increase the probability of electron transfer [70]. In the
regime where Á > , the inverted region, the rate constants do not
decrease with increasing driving force as expected in molecular
donor–acceptor electron transfer. In fact, the rate constants become
independent of the driving force [70]. As Weber et al. emphasize,
the magnitude of Á for which these effects are important is the
on the order of for a common redox species such as ferrocene.
Therefore, these effects require experimental consideration.
In order to determine kET by ﬁtting simulated CVs to experimental CVs, the following method has been developed. This description
is based on the outline given by Eggers et al. for a ferrocenemodiﬁed SAM [73]. CVs are simulated using Eqs. (2.17) and (2.18).
The current, i, as a function of time, t, during a CV sweep is given
by Eq. (2.17). T is the total coverage of Fc and Â Fc is the fractional
coverage of the ferrocenium ion ( O / T ). The change in Â Fc with
time for oxidation is calculated from Eq. (2.18). The values of kO and
kR are determined from Eqs. (2.20) and (2.21).

(2.19)

Eqs. (2.20) and (2.21) were developed to calculate the rate constants for oxidation (kO ) and reduction (kR ) of the redox species
[1,69,70]. Values of kO and kR are calculated using Marcus theory with Levich–Dogonadze electrode modiﬁcations in Eqs. (2.20)
and (2.21). These equations generate values for kO and kR that
are used in Eqs. (2.17) and (2.18). From these equations, CVs of
surface-bound redox species can be ﬁt to give E0 , , and kET . The
simulated peak potentials are ﬁt to the experimentally determined
peak potentials. To limit the number of CV ﬁt parameters, the apparent formal potential E0 from experimental data is used (the average
of the Epc and Epa ) and reorganization energy is ﬁxed, if known
from experimental data. Finally kO and kR are varied (by varying Ep
in Á = Ep − E 0 ) until the ﬁts of the simulated CV Ep values to the
experimental Ep values yield a reasonable goodness of ﬁt. However, this approach is not appropriate if there is signiﬁcant kinetic
heterogeneity in the system.

electrode and the current decay is immediately measured as a function of time (Fig. 2.4). In a double step experiment, the potential
is applied symmetrically around the formal potential of the redox
center in small increments. For example, if the formal potential
of the redox center is 0.0 V, the ﬁrst and second applied potentials
would be +0.05 V and −0.05 V. The potential limits of the electrolyte
and electrode must be taken into account when setting the potential limits. Importantly, the initial potential should be chosen such
that all redox centers are in the same oxidation state.
An important aspect is the length of time between potential
steps, which must allow for the complete decay of the current. For
accurate measurements is critical that the time be long enough for
the faradaic current to be separated from the charging current (the
initial current spike). High charging currents are generated initially
and decay with time and can therefore be temporally separated
from the faradaic response as long as the time constant for the
charging current is smaller than the rate constant for the faradaic
current. Large potential steps can lead to charging currents much
larger than the faradaic currents, complicating data analysis. The
appropriate time must be determined experimentally by observing
the time it takes for the current to return to baseline levels.
The measured current and applied potential vs. time are
required data for rate analysis. The overpotential (Á) should be corrected for iR drop as shown in Eq. (2.22). RSOL can be determined
using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (Section 2.6).

The rate as a function of time, kAPP (t), may be used rather than
rate as a function of overpotential, k(Á), due to kinetic heterogeneity. A simple means to determine if a distribution of kinetic sites is
apparent is to plot ln(i) vs. time. If this plot is curved rather than
linear as predicted, then kinetic heterogeneity must be considered
[74,75]. Different apparent rates can be observed during the current
decay depending on the amount of time passed. Therefore, the current decay may be divided into regimes where different amounts
of current (and time) have passed (for example, 80%, 50%, and 20%)
[76].
An experimental Tafel plot can be generated by plotting each
overpotential against the measured kAPP (t). This experimental Tafel
curve can be ﬁt to a theoretical curve generated using the Marcus
density of states model (Eqs. (2.15) and (2.16)). The ﬁt parameters
of the Marcus density of states model represent kET , and HAB [53].
This method has been used to analyze the electron transfer kinetics
for a variety of systems, including ferrocene and Ru(NH3 )5 systems
[1,74,76].
2.5. Alternating current voltammetry (ACV)
Alternating current (AC) voltammetry is similar to cyclic voltammetry in that it is a potential sweep method [46]. The equivalent
circuit model, the Randles circuit is shown in Fig. 2.5, and the waveform of ACV is shown in Fig. 2.6a. A starting and ending potential
are speciﬁed that index the E0 of the redox species. In addition, a
sinusoidally oscillating AC wave is superimposed on the potential
waveform. The frequency of the AC can be varied; the magnitude
of the AC oscillations is small compared to the overall change in
voltage. The resulting alternating current is recorded and the electrochemical response appears as a single peak.
Creager and Wooster have developed a method of determining the rate of electron transfer for redox species in a SAM [77].
A series of AC voltammograms are collected for a range of AC frequencies, where the ratio of the peak current, ip , to the background
current, ib , is determined for each frequency. The values of ip /ib are
plotted vs. the log of the AC frequency (Fig. 2.5b). This plot can be
ﬁt to the Randles equivalent circuit model [77]. The only variables
needed for determining kET are the double-layer capacitance (CDL ),
the charge transfer resistance (RCT ), electrode surface area (ASUR ),
and surface coverage ( ).
is measured independently using Eq.
(2.22). The four parameters in the Randles circuit are given by Eqs.

A number of articles have appeared that take advantage of
this approach to measure kET in peptides [78–80], short bridges
[45,57,81–84], and other novel systems [16,85–89]. There are several advantages to using this method to determine kET . First, the
input variables (CDL , , ASUR , RSOL ) are easily obtained from CV
or EIS measurements. Second, very low surface coverages can be
probed due to the inherent sensitivity of the ACV method. Further,
Creager and coworkers expanded the application of this method
to describe systems that have a distribution of rates, or systems
with pronounced kinetic heterogeneity (due to variations in the
molecular environment caused by SAM or surface defects) [90]
(Fig. 2.6c). Variations within rate ranges affect the ﬁt of the simulation to a segment of the ip /ib ratio plot. For example, variations
of the ﬁt within the 5000–10,000 s−1 range affect the simulated
ip /ib data at high frequencies while changes within the 1–100 s−1
range affect the simulated data at low frequencies (Fig. 2.6d). The
disadvantage of this approach is that only kET can be obtained; no
information regarding reorganization energy or electronic coupling
can be determined.
2.6. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)

Fig. 2.7. Schematic showing the effect of a resistor and a capacitor on the phase (ϕ)
of an alternating current (I) with respect to the voltage (E). For a resistor, current
and voltage are in phase. For a capacitor, voltage lags current by 90◦ .

The phase of the impedance (ϕ) in complex form is given by Eq.
(2.34).
ϕ = tan−1

ZIm
ZRe

(2.34)

EIS data is generally plotted in one of two ways, a Bode plot or a
Nyquist plot [46,93,94]. In Bode plots, the log of the magnitude of
the impedance, log(Z) (from Eq. (2.33)), and the phase, ϕ (from Eq.
(2.34)), are plotted separately vs. log(frequency) [46]. An example
of a Bode plot is shown in Fig. 2.8. In Nyquist, or, complex-plane
impedance plots, the ordinate is the imaginary axis, ZIm , and the
abscissa is the real axis, ZRe . For data analysis, Nyquist plots are
used much more frequently than Bode plots and are discussed in
more detail.
In the simplest case, a potential is chosen such that no ET occurs
(i.e., away from the E0 of the redox species attached to the monolayer). In this case, the faradaic component of the Randles circuit is

The Randles circuit is one of the simplest models for electron
transfer for a redox species attached to a monolayer, and will
be used to discuss electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)
(Fig. 2.5) [46,77,91]. EIS measures the frequency response of a system by measuring impedance, Z. This is done by applying a small
AC signal over a range of frequencies at a speciﬁed potential. Varying the frequency changes the relative contribution of each of the
elements in the Randles circuit to the overall impedance. Measuring impedances over a wide range of frequencies allows the value
of each individual element of the Randles circuit to be determined
[46,92–94].
RSOL and RCT only contribute to the in-phase, or, real component
of impedance (ZRe ). A resistor has no effect on the phase, ϕ, between
the voltage and current, so across RSOL and RCT , voltage and current
remain in phase (see Fig. 2.7). As shown in Fig. 2.7, the voltage lags
the current by 90◦ across a capacitor so the voltage and current are
out-of-phase across CDL and CAD . As such, CDL and CAD contribute
to the out-of phase, or, imaginary component of impedance (ZIm )
[46].
Using ZRe and ZIm , the general formula for Z can be written in
complex notation as in Eq. (2.32), where ω is the angular frequency
of the AC signal:
Z(ω)
√= ZRe − jZIm
j = −1

(2.32)

In general, the magnitude of the impedance (Z) in complex form
is given by Eq. (2.33).

not considered [46,77]. Only RSOL and CDL , connected in series, are
considered, and the impedances from each are additive. At high frequencies (ω → ∞) there is no time for CDL to charge, and the curve
approaches the ZRe axis at RSOL . As the frequency decreases there
is more time for CDL to charge, and, at low frequencies (ω → 0), the
main contribution to the impedance is from CDL . The result is a vertical line on the Nyquist plot, as the impedance contribution from
RSOL is unaffected by the frequency (Fig. 2.9).
When a speciﬁc potential is chosen where ET occurs (i.e., at or
near the E0 of the redox species attached to the monolayer) the
entire Randles circuit is considered. The additional RCT and CAD
contributions to the impedance complicate the derivation of the
equation representing the Nyquist plot, and the derivation will not
be presented here [95–97]. Only general trends of the resulting
Nyquist plot (an example is shown in Fig. 2.10) will be discussed.
At high frequencies, the plot is in the shape of an ellipse [77,97].
As ω → ∞ there is no time for ET to occur (RCT and CAD become
negligible), and there is no time for CDL to charge. Thus, as ω → ∞
the high frequency portion of the ellipse approaches the ZRe axis at
RSOL . Eq. (2.35) shows the center of the ellipse is located on the real

RCT
(1 + (CDL /CAD ))

(2.37)

However, at low frequencies the Nyquist plot ellipse never
approaches the ZRe axis. Instead, the plot becomes a vertical line
with an increasingly large ZIm component, as the CDL and CAD contributions dominate the impedance. If the vertical line continues to
the ZRe axis, the intercept would be at the same point where the
ellipse would cross the ZRe axis as ω → 0 (Eq. (2.37), Fig. 2.10).
In this case, RSOL can be directly measured, but ﬁtting programs
are typically used to determine the values of CDL , CAD , and RCT . Fitting programs are typically supplied with the potentiostat software.
Once these parameters are known, kET can be determined using Eq.
(2.38) [77].
kET =

RCT CAD

(2.38)

Using EIS, kET for N-(mercaptopentadecyl)ferrocenecarboxamide
in a monolayer of 16-mercaptohexanol was determined to be 9 s−1
[77]. In another example, kET for proton-coupled electron transfer
between a 1-aminoanthraquinone derivative and a gold electrode
through a monolayer with a 10-carbon alkyl spacer in 0.1 M
H2 SO4 was found to be 7.4 s−1 [98]. From this experiment, it was
determined that there was a large reorganization energy of 2.7 eV
for the 1-aminoanthraquinone ET.
EIS experiments can be quite useful as they allow several different parameters to be measured in one experiment. However,
problems may arise due to the non-ideal behavior of the system
under study. Non-ideal behavior can dramatically alter the values obtained from analysis based on the Randles circuit model.
For accurate data to be obtained these non-idealities must be
addressed. One way to treat these non-idealities is through the
use of additional circuit elements. A common method is to incorporate a constant phase element (CPE) into the circuit in place of
one or more of the elements in the Randles circuit. These types of
procedures have been described elsewhere [77,99–101].
2.7. Scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM)

Fig. 2.10. Examples of a Nyquist plots for a Randles circuit for a redox species
attached to a monolayer. R = RSOL , Z = ZRe , Z = ZIm . RSOL is 50 , CDL is 1 ␮F, CAD

for (1); this is what the plot would look like if CAD were 0 ␮F. See the text for descriptions of the partial ellipses and the vertical portion of the plots. Reproduced with
permission from Ref. [97].

Scanning electrochemical microscopy is similar to other scanning microscopic techniques such as STM [102,103]. SECM operates
by scanning or “rastering” a surface immersed in an electrolyte
solution with a metallic tip that acts as an electrode. The tip is typically micrometer-nanometer in size, or is an ultramicroelectrode
(UME). SECM allows the UME probe to be positioned very close
to the surface of interest, and therefore surface reactivity can be
mapped by scanning (Fig. 2.11) [102,103]. The observed signal is a
faradaic current from electroactive solution species.
SECM experiments can incorporate a redox molecule attached
to the monolayer or simply use the monolayer as a barrier to electron transfer between a redox species in solution and the electrode.
Measurement of the rate constants is done by plotting current as a
function of distance from the tip to the SAM-coated electrode and
ﬁtting the data to theoretical curves. One beneﬁt of SECM experiments is that double-layer charging current and resistive potential
drop are minimized because all measurements are made under

1778

statically bound. When cyt c was covalently attached to the SAM,
the kET was 9 s−1 . However, if the protein was electrostatically
bound, the kET was 15 s−1 . An even faster tunneling rate of 65 s−1
was observed when a mixed monolayer of 1:1 decanethiol and 11mercaptoundecanoic acid was used. The reason for faster tunneling
is presumed to be the increased mobility of cytochrome c when
electrostatically bound to surface of the monolayer, allowing for a
more efﬁcient orientation of the protein with respect to the electrode, making ET more favorable. The bimolecular ET rate between
cytochrome c and the mediator was measured to be approximately
2.2 × 108 cm3 mol−1 s−1 , consistent with literature values for this
type of process [105].

2.8. Indirect laser-induced temperature jump method (ILIT)

steady-state conditions (i.e., the tip is held at a constant electric
bias). Another beneﬁt is the ability to perform multiple measurements of rate constants at different points across the electrode
surface, allowing the spatial heterogeneity in the SAM to be determined.
SECM often uses mediators, redox species in solution that act as
electron shuttles between the SECM tip and the electrode. Electrochemical mediators are typically small redox-active species such as
methyl viologen, Ru(NH3 )6 3+ , or Fe(CN)6 3− . Mediators have been
used in many cases of protein electrochemistry where direct measurement is not possible [11,105].
SECM has been used to measure the rates of electron transfer through a monolayer using mediators in solution (Fig. 2.10)
[104,105]. With no redox species attached to the monolayer,
SECM allows the measurement of kET between a solution mediator
species to the electrode through the monolayer. However, when
a redox species is attached to the monolayer, SECM allows the
measurement of the rate of electron tunneling from the attached
redox species through the monolayer to the electrode. Further, the
bimolecular rate of electron transfer between the attached redox
species and the mediator in solution can be determined.
In one of the ﬁrst reports of this technique, electron transfer
rate constants were measured from monolayer-bound ferrocenium to both the electrode (through the monolayer) and to a
[Ru(NH3 )6 ]2+ mediator in solution [104]. The standard rate constant
for ET between the electrode and [FcCONH(CH2 )15 SH]+ with hexadecanethiol as the diluent was 7.0 s−1 . When [FcCONH(CH2 )7 SH]+
was used with nonanethiol as the diluent, the standard ET rate constant was 1.2 × 105 s−1 . As expected for a tunneling mechanism,
the kET decreased exponentially as the number of methylene units
increased [30,38,41,106]. The tunneling decay constant for this process was found to be 1.0 per methylene unit, consistent with other
values reported for this type of monolayer. The bimolecular electron transfer rate between the mediator, [Ru(NH3 )6 ]3+ , and the
ferrocene bound to the monolayer was found to be greater than
4.5 × 1010 cm3 mol−1 s−1 . In addition, the kET for electron transfer
from the [Ru(NH3 )6 ]2+ mediator through a nonelectroactive monolayer was measured. In this case, the mediator was regenerated by
electron tunneling through the monolayer.
SECM has been used by Holt to measure the ET kinetics of
cytochrome c attached to 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid monolayers
using [Fe(CN)6 ]3− as the mediator [105]. Notably, slower tunneling
rates were observed for cytochrome c covalently attached to the
SAM via amide linkages formed between protein lysines and the
acids of the monolayer, as opposed to proteins that were electro-

CV and CA are generally considered to be limited to measuring
rates that are <104 s−1 . An indirect laser-induced temperature jump
(ILIT) technique was developed to measure rates for short bridge
lengths [56]. A short (ns) laser pulse impinges onto the backside
of a thin gold ﬁlm electrode. The absorbed laser energy is rapidly
(<1 ps) diffused as heat throughout the gold causing a small change
(2–4 ◦ C) in the temperature of the on the other side of the gold
ﬁlm at the SAM/electrolyte solution interface. The interfacial equilibrium is altered and the open circuit potential of the electrode
changes. This method requires highly specialized equipment and is
not readily available.

2.9. Summary of electrochemical methods
To summarize this section, four common electrochemical
techniques have been described that allow the quantitative determination of electron transfer parameters such as , G, HAB , and
kET . It is important to recognize the advantages and limitations of
each of these techniques before performing electrochemical experiments to measure any of these parameters.
Cyclic voltammetry is the most common technique, largely
because the faradaic current is readily separated from the charging
current. CV allows measurement of the electron transfer parameters, ,
G, HAB , and kET . The Laviron method is relatively
straightforward. However, it is limited, and often the Marcus density of states theory must be applied. Chronoamperometry is a facile
technique that has been employed to determine , HAB , and kET .
In CA measurements, the faradaic current is temporally separated
from the charging current. As with CV data, Tafel plots are ﬁt using
Marcus theory. An important aspect of chronoamperometry is that
it is very sensitive to kinetic heterogeneity. Finally, the solution
resistance should always be considered in CV and CA measurements, as it can lead to anomalously low reorganization energies.
Alternating current voltammetry is the ideal method for identifying the subpopulations contributing to a distribution of rates. The
main disadvantage of this method is that only kET can be obtained.
, G, and HAB must be determined using other methods. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy is used to determine kET as well
as RSOL and CDL . However, as with the ACV method, , G, and HAB
cannot be determined. Experiments are fairly simple to perform but
because the phase must be considered, data analysis is complicated
and can be difﬁcult to interpret. Another disadvantage of EIS is that
non-idealities can dramatically alter the values of the ET parameters obtained. Finally, SECM allows kET to be determined for both
adsorbed and solution species in single experiments. The small size
of the SECM tip allows information about SAM surface reactivity to
be mapped. Another advantage of SECM is that CDL and resistive
potential drop are minimized since measurements are made under
steady-state conditions.

accessible redox potential.

3. Redox species used for electrochemical determination of
kET in monolayers
Metal complexes that are selected for electrochemical SAM
studies exhibit reversible electrochemical reactions in which both
oxidation states are stable. Often, these complexes have a high coordination number and small ligands that are substitutionally inert
(Fig. 3.1). These redox centers possess negligible inner-sphere
values. Finally, an essential parameter is that redox potential must
be energetically accessible (i.e., it must be within the potential window that is determined by (1) the SAM stability and (2) the electrolyte
and solvent).

3.1. Ferrocene
Ferrocene was discovered in 1951 by Kealy and Pauson who
were attempting to synthesize fulvalene [107]. This complex is the
ﬁrst widely known organometallic compound that deﬁed deﬁnition until 1952 when the structure was determined [108,109]. Two
cyclopentadienyl (Cp) anions coordinate Á5 to one Fe(II) cation
resulting in an overall neutral complex (Fig. 3.1). The complex is
small, measuring approximately 4.1 Å × 3.3 Å. The ferrocenium ion
is only slightly different, measuring 4.1 Å × 3.5 Å, indicating that
the inner-sphere reorganization energy is low. The carbon–carbon
bond distances are 1.40 Å within the cyclopentadienyl rings, and
the bond distances between the iron and the carbon atoms are
2.04 Å. This “sandwich” structure has been duplicated using a variety of transition metals including ruthenium, cobalt and nickel but
these complexes have not been used in electrochemical SAM studies.
The most stable, electrochemically addressable oxidation states
of iron in ferrocene are Fe(II) and Fe(III) [110]. The Fe(II) state is
orange whereas Fe(III) (the ferrocenium ion) has a characteristic
blue color. The electronic properties of ferrocene are acutely sensitive to functional groups attached to the Cp ring (Fig. 3.1) [111–114].
Ferrocene is highly soluble in organic solvents, insoluble in
aqueous media and undergoes reactions characteristic of aromatic compounds, enabling the preparation of a wide variety
of substituted derivatives [114–124]. A wide variety of symmetric and asymmetric derivatives are commercially available,
such as ferrocene carboxylic acid, ferrocene dicarboxylic acid, and
dimethylaminomethyl ferrocene. A common synthetic approach
is the Friedel–Crafts reaction. Ferrocene reacts readily with butyl
lithium to give 1,1 -dilithioferrocene, which is a versatile synthetic
precursor to symmetric compounds [125,126]. With the emergence

of click chemistry, azide and alkyne derivatives have been utilized
[127,128]. The covalent incorporation of ferrocene into peptides
[129–134], peptide nucleic acids [135–137], and DNA [6,138,139]
has been accomplished due to the ease of functionalization. A
selection of orthogonally functionalized asymmetric ferrocenes has
recently been reported [140].
3.2. Ruthenium ammine complexes
The ruthenium center in ruthenium(III) hexaammine trichloride
is octahedral and symmetric with six NH3 ligands (Fig. 3.1). The
Ru–N bonds are 2.104 Å, which changes only very slightly to 2.144 Å
upon reduction to Ru(II) [141]. Unlike the anionic Cp ligands of
ferrocene, however, the neutral ammine ligands do not neutralize
the charge. This pale yellow complex is highly soluble in aqueous
media, and in 1965 the reduction of [Ru(NH3 )6 ]3+ was shown to
result in the stable [Ru(NH3 )6 ]2+ species [142]. The solubility and
stability of this complex has led to its wide use as an electrochemical
standard.
Ruthenium ammine complexes have a rich history in inorganic
chemistry [143]. The [Ru(NH3 )5 Cl]2+ intermediate is synthetically
versatile and a wide range of ligands have been explored. One of
the most well known examples is the ﬁrst complex of dinitrogen,
[Ru(NH3 )5 N2 ]2+ reported by Allen and Senoff in 1965 [144,145].
Taube won the Nobel Prize in 1983 for his studies of electron transfer using the mixed valence pyrazine-bridged dinuclear complex
[Ru(NH3 )5 pzRu(NH3 )5 ]5+ otherwise known as the Creutz–Taube
complex [146].
Ruthenium(II) pentaammine complexes are synthesized by the
reduction of [Ru(NH3 )5 Cl]Cl2 to give [Ru(NH3 )5 (H2 O)]2+ that has a
labile inner-sphere water ligand (Fig. 3.2). The water ligand can be
replaced by a wide variety of N donor ligands (L) such as nitriles
and N-heterocycles and the redox potential of these complexes is
highly sensitive to functionalization of these N-heterocycle rings
[147,148]. The relevant parameters for calculating i have been
reported for [Ru(NH3 )5 (py)]2+/3+ [149]. The Ru(II)–Npy bond distance in [Ru(NH3 )5 (py)]2+ changes only from 2.058 Å to 2.077 Å
upon oxidation to Ru(III), indicating a small i . A wide variety of
stable ruthenium(II) tetraammine complexes [Ru(NH3 )4 L2 ]2+ have
been isolated and characterized (Fig. 3.1) [150,151].
3.3. Osmium
The coordination chemistry of osmium closely parallels that
of ruthenium [152,153]. Os(II), Os(III), and Os(IV) complexes of

Fig. 3.3. Os(II) bipyridine complexes commonly used for SAM electrochemistry.

SAM substrate electrode, these molecules are typically immobilized on ITO. This transparent conducting material allows for
photoinduced processes to be examined by measuring photovoltage or photocurrent. For applications in artiﬁcial photosynthesis,
porphyrin–fullerene dyads and triads have been covalently incorporated onto SAMs [164–172].
C60 has been noncovalently attached to SAMs [158,179]. In one
instance, a crown ether-functionalized C60 was incorporated into
a SAM by the interactions between the crown ether and ammonium groups on a modiﬁed electrode [158]. The resorcinarene
molecule has been used as a recognition element to incorporate
unsubstituted C60 molecules to SAMs [179]. The majority of the
electron transfer studies involving C60 have used spectroscopic
techniques [15,164,180–182]. Electrochemical methods have not
been reported to study ET kinetics for C60 for comparison with
ferrocene or other metal complexes.
3.5. Redox species in solution

N-heterocycles such as bipyridine and phenanthroline are the
most widely used for electrochemical studies due to the synthetic
accessibility from K2 OsCl6 . The stability, redox potential accessibility, and photochemical properties have been widely reported
[154–157]. Examples of osmium complexes most commonly used
in SAM studies are shown in Fig. 3.3.
3.4. Buckminsterfullerene (C60 )
C60 possesses eight accessible oxidation states [158–161] and
has small inner-sphere reorganization energy (∼0.06 eV) [162,163].
This low i is most often cited as the attribute of C60 that leads
to efﬁcient photoinduction of a long-lived charge-separated state.
C60 has been incorporated into numerous porphyrin constructs as
models for photosynthesis [164–172] (Fig. 3.4).
C60 has been functionalized and covalently immobilized on
SAMs [173–178]. Although Au and Hg have been used as the

To measure ET parameters of redox species in solution using
electrochemistry, it is often necessary to use a large Á (Eq. (2.4),
up to 1 V or greater). This measurement requires slow rates of ET
in order to avoid mass transfer limitations [41,46,53]. The simplest
way to achieve these slow rates for redox species in solution is to
passivate the electrode with a SAM (Fig. 3.5). The SAM acts as a barrier to electron transfer, slowing the rate between the redox species
in solution and the electrode. The thickness of the monolayer can be
changed to tune the rate of ET to ranges applicable for the desired
ET studies.
In work by Miller et al., different monolayer thicknesses were
prepared by using hydroxyalkane thiols of varying chain lengths
(from 2 to 16 methylene units) on a gold electrode [38]. CVs were
obtained with [Fe(CN)6 ]3− and [Fe(H2 O)6 ]3+ in solution. Capacitance measurements conﬁrmed the monolayers were free from
pinhole defects. As expected for a tunneling mechanism, a logarithmic relationship was found between kAPP and the thickness of
the monolayer for both complexes. Tafel plots showed curvature
at large overpotentials in agreement with predictions made from
Marcus theory [24,38,53,61,183]. The tunneling constant (ˇ, Eq.
(6.1)) for this ET process was measured to be 0.9 per methylene unit.
In this experiment it was shown that SAMs act as an effective barrier to ET from a redox species in solution to the electrode, allowing
large overpotentials to be used without mass transfer limitations.
3.6. Metal clusters
Metal clusters provide a versatile platform for monolayer modiﬁcation that would otherwise be difﬁcult to achieve using more
conventional complexes. Metal clusters have multiple coordination sites that allow formation of multilayers on the surface of

SAMs [184–186]. Layered structures have been shown to have
enhanced properties in a variety of applications such as molecular
electronics and sensors [184]. Trinuclear ruthenium clusters of the
form [Ru3 (␮3 -O)(␮-CH3 COO)6 (bpy)2 (CO)] (bpy = 4,4 -bipyridine)
are one example of clusters that can be used for controlled
layer-by-layer deposition of electroactive multilayer formation
[184–186] (Fig. 3.6). These complexes have two Ru(III) centers
and one Ru(II) center and a CO is bound to the Ru(II) center
of the cluster. Attachment to the monolayer has been accomplished via peptide coupling between a terminal acid on the
monolayer and the amine of 4-aminomethylpyridine (4-AMP)
of [Ru3 (␮3 -O)(␮-CH3 COO)6 (4-AMP)(4-MePy)(CO)]. Upon electrochemical oxidation to Ru(III), the CO dissociates forming an aquo
species. This results in a free reactive site for attachment of the
next layer. The next layer is formed by the addition of a [Ru3 (␮3 O)(␮-CH3 COO)6 (bpy)2 (CO)] molecule that forms a dative bond
from one of the bpy nitrogens to the ruthenium of the cluster
and repeating this process forms the multilayer [184,185]. It was
observed that E1/2 for the RuIII/II couple shifts +45 mV for loosely
packed multilayers, but up to +90 mV for more compact, densely
packed multilayers. This result has been attributed to the decreased
access of anions into the multilayer in the latter [185]. A similar
approach has been used to construct a layer of dinuclear [Ru2 (␮O)(␮-CH3 COO)2 (2,2 -bpy)2 (4,4 -bpy)2 ](PF6 )2 on top of a SAM of
[Ru3 (␮3 -O)(␮-CH3 COO)6 (4-AMP)(4-MePy)(CO)] (Fig. 3.7) [186].
[Ni3 (␮3 -I)(␮3 -CNR)(␮2 -dppm)3 ]+ has been studied using SAM
electrochemistry (dppm is 1,1-bis(diphenylphosphino)methane
and the R group is phenylthiolate) (Fig. 3.8) [187]. This nickel cluster
has been shown to form monolayers on gold having a coverage of
3.74 × 10−10 mol/cm2 signifying a single, well-deﬁned monolayer.
It has been shown that these electroactive SAMs show rectiﬁcation behavior. Speciﬁcally, electron transfer from the electrode to a
redox acceptor in solution is permitted only at potentials negative
of E0 of the trinuclear nickel cluster. Thus, the nickel cluster must
be reduced from Ni3 + to Ni3 0 before reduction of a solution species
can occur. Therefore, the Ni3 + species acts as a barrier to electron
transfer to an acceptor in solution at potentials more positive than
E0 of the trinuclear nickel cluster, and obviously, more negative
than E0 of the acceptor in solution. No effect was seen on the electron transfer from the species in solution (donor) to the electrode
(the anodic peak in a CV is unaffected).

In addition to trinuclear ruthenium and nickel clusters, gold
nanoparticle clusters attached to SAMs have been studied (Fig. 3.9)
[17,188]. These gold clusters have been used to improve electronic
coupling between metalloproteins and electrodes [17]. Recently a
construct incorporating gold clusters was used to form an electrical
contact between CuII of the redox metalloenzyme galactose oxidase
[17]. A monolayer of biphenyl dithiols was formed on the electrode
and this SAM was incubated in a solution of thioctic acid-capped
gold clusters to assemble the gold clusters on the SAM.
The galactose oxidase is immobilized on the cluster-SAM assembly by substitution of a labile water of the Cu(II) site of the enzyme
with the terminal acid of thioctic acid. Fast electron transfer occurs
between a stable tyrosyl radical of the galactose oxidase and the
electrode, mediated by the gold cluster. Slow electron transfer was
observed between the copper of galactose oxidase and the electrode. The immobilized galactose oxidase maintains its ability to
catalytically reduce oxygen.
4. Outer-sphere effects on electron transfer kinetics
Noncovalent interactions such as ion pairing, van der Waals
forces, hydrogen bonds, and solvent polarizability affect o and
can have a signiﬁcant impact on kET [24]. o is difﬁcult to measure
and the error is typically on the order of ±0.1 eV, and few reports
have focused on determining this parameter [1,76,157,189–195].
Values of o obtained from independent variable temperature and
variable driving force experiments do not always agree. Ion-pairing
effects [154,191], double-layer effects [196], uncompensated solution resistance effects [74], and the presence of a heterogeneous
distribution of rate constants [75] are all possible contributors to
the discrepancies.
The reorganization energy and preexponential factor can be
obtained from an Arrhenius analysis [45]. kET is determined for a
range of temperatures and ln(kET ) is plotted vs. 1/T. The activation
energy EA is calculated as kB times the slope of the Arrhenius plot
and the apparent reorganization energy is calculated using Eq. (4.1).
The Arrhenius preexponential factor A and activation energy EA are
given by Eq. (4.2).

4.1. Solvent and counterion effects
SAMs of [Os(bpy)2 Cl(pNp)]− (N = 2,1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethane;
N = 3,4,4 -trimethylenedipyridine) were studied using CA [154].
The inﬂuence of solvent on the kinetics and thermodynamics
of electron transfer was explored using acetonitrile, acetone,
dimethylformamide, dichloroethane, tetrahydrofuran, and chloroform. For the p2p monolayers, the kET ranges from 7.4 × 103 s−1
(CHCl3 ) to 1.1 × 105 s−l (MeCN). For the same solvents, the p3p
monolayer kET values are 1.6 × 103 s−l and 1.8 × 104 s−l , respectively. For both these monolayers, a linear correlation was observed
between the rate and the longitudinal relaxation rate of the solvent,

suggesting that electron transfer is strongly inﬂuenced by solvent
reorganization dynamics.
Although is routinely determined as part of ﬁtting Tafel plots,
only one study has been undertaken to speciﬁcally probe changes
in o [74]. SAMs of [Ru(NH3 )5 pyCH2 NHCO(CH2 )n SH]2+ (n = 10 or
15) diluted with HO2 C(CH2 )n SH alkane thiols were studied using
10 solvents: acetonitrile, acetone, methanol, ethanol, n-propanol,
n-butanol, N,N-dimethylformamide, dimethylsulfoxide, propylene
carbonate and tetrahydrofuran. Values of were determined by
generating a Tafel plot from CA data and ﬁtting using the Marcus
density of states model. The measured for water (0.8–0.9 eV) is
consistent with the value of 0.9–1.0 eV predicted by Marcus’ equation for (Eq. (2.10)). The anodic is greater than or equal to the
cathodic in nonaqueous solvents which the authors attribute to
strong ion-pairing.
Using Eq. (2.10), o varies from 0.92 eV to 0.75 eV. It is proposed
that there may be a high local water concentration at the surface
of the monolayer that solvates the redox centers [74]. No effort
was made to dry the organic solvents and it seems likely that this
scenario would lead to values similar to those measured for aqueous conditions. The nonpolar solvents propanol, butanol, and THF
show low o values as predicted by Eq. (2.10). The authors recognize the difﬁculty in determining accurately and do not indicate a
breakdown of the assumptions behind Eq. (2.10). The authors further suggest this may be a way to estimate o of redox centers on
a monolayer (Table 4.1).
The effect of the counterion (BF4 − , ClO4 − , and PF6 − ) on kET
of a ferrocenyl peptide SAM was examined [191]. Twelve noncyclic and cyclic ferrocene-containing peptides were immobilized
on gold microelectrodes via a cystamine disulﬁde bond. The kET and
were determined using variable temperature CV. The kET ranged
from (4.4 to 12) × 103 s−1 . The highest reorganization energy was
observed for the BF4 − counterion, which has the weakest association with the ferrocenium cation. The more rigid cyclic peptides

were found to have smaller reorganization energies ranging from
0.3 eV to 0.5 eV compared to the more ﬂexible noncyclic ferrocenyl
peptides (0.5–1.0 eV).
4.2. Proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET)
Besides being of fundamental scientiﬁc interest, the details
of how protons and electrons are transferred remain an area
of intense theoretical and experimental interest [67,197,198].
Proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) has been implicated in
numerous biological processes, including enzyme reactions, photosynthesis, and respiration [199–203]. Technological applications
include alternative energy sources (fuel and solar cells), sensors, and molecular electronics. Further, organic radicals are
of interest in nanostructured magnetic materials. The study of
surface-bound radicals is directed towards the development of
organic ferromagnets that show long-range magnetic order in
the crystalline phase. TEMPO and galvinoxyl are highly stable radicals that persist at room temperature and have been
studied using SAMs [190,204–206]. A number of excellent
reviews cover the area of PCET in greater detail [66,67]. In
this section we highlight examples for comparison of kET with

the alkane thiol electron transfer systems described in this
review.
Possible mechanisms of PCET are stepwise and concerted
mechanisms for proton and electron transfer. In the stepwise mechanism, ET and PT occur separately [67]. The pH dependence of ET
can be studied to elucidate this mechanism. In the concerted mechanism, ET and PT occur in the same rate-determining step. This
mechanism is most often investigated by taking advantage of the
kinetic isotope effect [207].
For PCET studies, it is desirable to investigate a system that
electrochemically accessible over the full range of pH-dependent
behavior. Reports from Takeuchi et al. [208,209] regarding the
promising behavior of [Os(II/III)(terpy)(bpy)(H2 O)] led Finklea
and coworkers to develop [Os(II)(bpy)2 (4-AMP)(H2 O)], which has
a suitable potential and pH dependence PCET studies [205].
Os(II)(bpy)2 (H2 O)(4-AMP) was attached to a HO2 C-terminated
alkane thiol monolayer via peptide coupling (Fig. 5.4). Thermodynamically, the attached Os(II) aquo species exhibits the expected
behavior for a 1 electron, 1 proton system. The formal potential
varies with pH, reaching constant values at pH < 2 (0.3 V vs. SCE)
and pH > 9 (−0.11 V vs. SCE). These potentials and pKa values are
in agreement with those found for the solution species [208,209].
Kinetically, however, this system deviates considerably from predictions of the stepwise model. At low and high pH values, the
cathodic is substantially less than the anodic (0.6 eV and 1.4 eV,
respectively). The plot of log(kET ) vs. pH does not have the shape
predicted by the stepwise model [205]. Finally, ˛ is consistently
∼0.5 at all pH values. This behavior is attributed to a concerted
PCET mechanism.
For comparison Os(bpy)2 Cl(4-AMP) was attached to a HO2 Cterminated alkane thiol monolayer to investigate the effects of the
HO2 C SAM functionality. The formal potential did not vary with
pH, indicating that any double-layer effects are negligible. was
found to be slightly different for the anodic (0.64 eV) and cathodic
(0.57 eV) peaks and the average kET was found to be 11 ± 1 s−1 .
The Os(II) aquo system was studied further by Finklea and
coworkers using D2 O to investigate any kinetic isotope effect on

the PT/ET mechanism [192]. Asymmetric Tafel plots for this system showed different s for the Os(II) and Os(III) species. The for
Os(III) had no pH dependence (0.6–0.7 eV over the pH range). On
the other hand, for Os(II) showed a pH dependence (0.70–1.0 eV
over the pH range with smaller s found close to the pKa of the
complex). The pH dependence of accounts for most of the dependence of electron transfer rate on pH. The authors concluded that
a concerted mechanism was appropriate to describe PCET for this
system.
In recent reports by Costentin et al, the solution PCET behavior
of [Os(bpy)2 (py)(H2 O)]2+/3+ was studied [210,211]. In this work, it
was demonstrated that the rate constants of this species follow the
stepwise model. These results are in contrast to Finklea’s analogous
SAM-bound osmium complex, suggesting that the carboxylic acids
at the SAM-solution interface are the proton source and sink for the
concerted proton-coupled electron transfer observed for Finklea’s
complex (shown in Fig. 5.6).
One of the most widely recognized redox-active organic
molecules is hydroquinone that undergoes a 2 electron oxidation
and corresponding loss of 2 protons. The pH dependence of kET of
hydroquinone attached to the electrode via a saturated alkane (HQC11) or conjugated OPV (HQ-OPV) bridge has been examined (pH
8–12.6) (Fig. 4.1) [16,212]. These hydroquinone SAMs were diluted
with octane-1-thiol. The electrochemistry for both HQ-C11 and HQOPV is near-ideal and reversible at basic pH values. The value of ˛
is 0.48 for HQ-OPV at pH 12.6 and 0.55 for HQ-C11 [16,212]. Laviron’s equation was used to evaluate kET . For the protonated form
of hydroquinone, the nature of the bridge has a signiﬁcant effect
on kET , 0.1 s−1 for HQ-C11 and 77 s−1 for HQ-OPV. For the deprotonated form of hydroquinone, the kET is less sensitive to the nature
of the bridge, 120 s−1 for HQ-C11 and 268 s−1 for HQ-OPV.
2-Methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone has been derivatized with
alkane thiols consisting of 5–12 atoms in the bridge [213] (Fig. 4.2).
The Laviron method was used to evaluate the kAPP and in acidic
conditions the −ln(kAPP ) for the 12-atom bridge was 10.4. The ˇ of
0.89 ± 0.16 per bridge atom agrees with previously reported values
for pentaammine(pyridine) ruthenium-terminated (1.06 ± 0.04)
SAMs [45].
Galvinol was modiﬁed with an alkane thiol and attached to
a SAM on a gold electrode for electrochemical studies of PCET

[204,205], the galvinoxyl was attached to the SAM via the R group, an alkane thiol.

[204,205] (Fig. 4.3). The predicted asymmetry in the CVs was
observed for pH < 11. For the deprotonated galvinol/galvinoxyl
radical redox couple, the kET at pH 10–13 was determined to
be 4.5 × 103 s−1 . The inner- and outer-sphere s for galvinol
have not been reported, but the similarity of the galvinolSAM kET to that for a ferrocene-labeled SAM with the same
alkane bridge suggests the total may be comparable to that of
ferrocene (∼0.8 eV).
Galvinoxyl layers on Au(1 1 1) have been studied by STM, EPR,
and CV [206]. In the STM, two phases are observed with different
molecular densities. EPR results conﬁrm that the radical character
of galvinoxyl is preserved. A one-electron oxidation with corresponding loss of a proton was determined from oxidation potential
vs. pH curves and is similar to the behavior of the free radical in
solution. This indicates there is no dramatic change of the electronic
properties of the radical upon adsorption [206].
4-Amino-TEMPO (Fig. 4.3) was coupled to a carboxylic acidterminated SAMs of HO2 C(CH2 )10 SH on gold electrodes and
analyzed using CV [190] and analysis of the CVs gave a kET of 1.2 s−1 .
The reorganization energies of TEMPO· and TEMPO+ were found to
be 1.5 eV and 1.3 eV, respectively. These values are the ﬁrst experimental measurements of of TEMPO in aqueous solution.
4.3. Metalloproteins
Electron transfer rates in proteins have been extensively studied by modifying the protein with transition metal chromophores
and using photochemical initiation, direct photoinduced ET, and
ﬂash-quench methods [30]. Protein-bound Ru(II)bpy species are
irradiated and the excited state is quenched by a reagent in solution. The resulting species undergoes ET with the protein active site
via thermal electron transfer. Marcus theory describes these reactions quite well and has shown that the protein shell lowers the
barrier to electron transfer by excluding solvent [29,30,214].
4.3.1. Cytochrome c
Cytochrome c is a small (12 kDa) electron transfer protein containing a heme redox center that has been the subject of extensive
study [27,31,188,193,194,215–230]. Modiﬁcation of electrodes for
the immobilization of cytochrome c was ﬁrst reported by Taniguchi
in 1982 [231]. The ﬁrst systematic study of ET using cyt c on SAMmodiﬁed electrodes was carried out by Bowden and kET was found
to be 0.4 s−1 for HO2 (CH2 )15 SH on gold [232]. The decay constant
was 1.0 Å−1 and was found to be 0.35 eV [232]. Differences in
horse heart cyt c and yeast cyt c were probed using mixed monolayers of HO(CH2 )n SH/HO2 C(CH2 )n SH [233]. It was found that the
mixed monolayers increase the rate for both while pure HO2 Cterminated monolayers gave most efﬁcient ET for the horse heart
cyt c. This ﬁnding correlates with what is known about the native
biological ET partners of these metalloproteins. For horse heart cyt

A.L. Eckermann et al. / Coordination Chemistry Reviews 254 (2010) 1769–1802

c, the ET pathway contains ionic interactions where as for yeast the
pathway is nonionic.
Cyt c was adsorbed on Ag electrodes and investigated using
electrochemistry and SERRS in 1980 [229]. More recently, the
protein was electrostatically bound to Ag using a carboxylic
acid-terminated (HO2 C(CH2 )n SH) SAM [222,234–236]. Structural
changes were observed at short lengths (n < 6) and the kET was
determined to be 0.073 s−1 for n = 16 and 43 s−1 for n = 11. For n ≤ 6,
kET was 134 s−1 . A kinetic isotope effect was observed, indicating
a rearrangement of hydrogen bonds and that proton transfer (PT)
is rate limiting for these cases. PT dynamics slow with increasing
bridge length.
This result indicates that the high electric ﬁeld (experienced
when the bridge lengths are short) raises the energy barrier. In a
related study, was determined to be 0.26 eV, which is low compared with 0.6 eV found in solution, and is attributed to poor solvent
access to the protein redox center once it is bound to the SAM [235].
From this work, it appears that a short SAM results in conformational gating as the high electric ﬁeld raises the activation barrier
for protein structure reorganization [222,234,235].
SERRS was employed to study cyt c on SAMs on Ag and Au using
a pyridine-terminated (pyCH2 NHCO(CH2 )n SH) SAM that provides
a binding ligand for the cyt c heme [236]. A potential-dependent
coordination equilibrium was observed. The reduced form is a ﬁvecoordinate high-spin state and the oxidized form is a six-coordinate
low-spin state. The kET is 760 s−1 that is in good agreement with
780 ± 40 s−1 measured previously [221,237].
In another study using the same pyridine-terminated SAMs,
was found to be 0.5 ± 0.1 eV [238]. As expected for weak coupling,
the rate was nonadiabatic for long bridge lengths (n ≥ 12). For short
bridge lengths, the data are best ﬁt by a model that includes friction
between the solvent and the protein that slows the polarization
relaxation [238]. This ﬁnding is in contrast to HO2 C-terminated
SAMs that are conformationally gated due to the high electric ﬁeld
at short bridge lengths [222,234,235].
Variations appear in the reported E0 (ranging from 0.0 V
to −0.06 V vs. SCE) and kET (20–100 s−1 ) of cyt c on MUA
[222,223,232–234,239]. The source of these variations was
addressed by Millo et al. [240]. The authors propose that the
source of the error lies in the requirement of different surfaces
for different types of measurements. SERRs requires a rough Ag
surface whereas SEIRA uses a rough Au surface and CV uses smooth
Au. Cyt c was electrostatically bound to SAMs adsorbed on all
four types of surface (Au-rough, smooth; Ag-rough, smooth) and
studied by CV. It was determined that E0 (−0.068 V vs. SCE) is
not dependent on the metal or the morphology. However the kET
is dependent on the metal (16 s−1 on Ag and 33 s−1 on Au), for
reasons outlined in Section 7.
4.3.2. Azurin
Azurin is found in the electron transport chains of bacteria and has been thoroughly characterized [13,29,32,203,214,218,
224,230,241–248]. The active site consists of a mononuclear copper ion that lies in the plane of three ligands (two His and a Cys)
with one axial ligand (Met) and a weak interaction with a peptide
carbonyl oxygen. The coordination geometry is highly restricted
by the protein shell and changes little between oxidation states,
resulting in a of 0.7–1.0 eV [30].
A number of studies have adsorbed azurin on gold electrodes, modiﬁed with long (nCH2 = 10) and short (nCH2 = 6)
alkane thiol SAMs for electrochemical studies [249,250]. Ideal
behavior was observed resulting in kET (long) = 470 ± 50 s−1 and
kET (short) = 3200 ± 300 s−1 [249]. In another study, hydrophobic
interactions between the hydrophobic area around the copper center in azurin and methyl headgroups of alkane thiol are proposed to
stabilize the adsorption of the protein on the SAM [250]. Azurin is

1785

most likely oriented with the redox center facing the electrode surface. The length of the alkane thiol was varied and an exponential
distance decay with ˇ = 1.03 ± 0.02 per CH2 unit was observed for
alkane thiols of lengths >9 CH2 units. Apparent rate constants (kAPP )
were determined using Laviron’s method and EIS. The results for
these two methods are in close agreement (70 s−1 , n = 11; 0.1 s−1 ,
n = 17). However, was reported to be 0.3 eV, signiﬁcantly lower
than small molecule redox species such as ferrocene on a SAM,
and was ascribed to the hydrophobic nature of the environment
imposed by the SAM.
Squarewave voltammetry has been used to examine the electrochemical properties of azurin adsorbed onto alkane thiol SAMs
on gold [251]. No kinetic isotope effect was observed and the pH
showed no effect on kET . The viscosity of the solution was increased
and found to have no effect on kET . The data indicate that the electron transfer reaction is gated by a preceding process and ﬁt well
for kET of 1 × 103 s−1 and = 0.7 eV.
A mixed monolayer using a 1:1 mixture of H3 C(CH2 )n SH and
HO(CH2 )n SH (n = 11, 15) on gold was used to study azurin [220].
Site-directed mutagenesis was used to identify amino acid residues
crucial to electron transfer. Only wild-type azurin, and mutants
containing Trp48, exhibited voltammetric responses. Using Laviron’s method, kET was determined to be 63 s−1 with a long alkane
thiol (nCH2 = 11) SAM. A linear relationship between log(kET ) and
chain length was found for longer chains (nCH2 > 6), with a slope of
1.0/CH2 . It is proposed that electronic coupling between the SAM
headgroup (H3 C– and/or HO–) and speciﬁc amino acid residues is
important to electron transfer.
In a related study, it was found that the ionic strength does
not have an effect on the kET of azurin adsorbed onto HO/CH3
terminated SAMs, indicating that hydrophobic interactions are
more important than ionic interactions [252]. The kET plateaus at
1 × 103 s−1 (nCH2 < 9) due to protein–SAM interfacial dynamics.
Azurin electron transfer was compared using SAMs of a stilbenebased thiol (a conjugated bridge) and an alkane thiol (saturated
bridge) [253]. The stilbene-based wire gave a kET of 1600 s−1
(15.8 Å) while the aliphatic comparisons were 481 s−1 (14.5 Å)
and 600 s−1 (17 Å). Interestingly, the conjugated bridge does not
increase kET by orders of magnitude as observed for ferrocenebased studies [44,45,57,254].
The effect of urea on the azurin protein structure was probed
electrochemically [255]. Urea is known to denature proteins and
it was presumed that if the protein denatured while adsorbed to
the SAM, changes in the reorganization energy would be observed.
Surprisingly, is not sensitive to high concentrations of urea indicating the active site is not perturbed. Longer alkane chain lengths
yielded larger values indicating that longer chain lengths result
in larger structural ﬂuctuations. The shorter chain lengths correspond to higher electric ﬁeld strengths which may inhibit these
ﬂuctuations.
Azurin was recently studied using nanoparticle ﬁlms on electrodes [256]. The nanoparticle ﬁlm was formed by linking gold
nanoparticles using alkane dithiols. Azurin was adsorbed onto the
resulting surface and studied electrochemically. The kET for the
nanoparticle ﬁlm was very fast (where ˇ ∼ 0.01/CH2 ) indicating a
hopping rather than a tunneling mechanism. In contrast, the kET of
azurin on a SAM directly on the electrode showed a kET of 12–20 s−1
and ␤ = 0.9/CH2 [256].
4.3.3. Superoxide dismutases (SODs)
The pH dependence of kET has been studied for three kinds
of superoxide dismutases (SODs), bovine erythrocyte copper–zinc
superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn-SOD), iron superoxide dismutase
from Escherichia coli (Fe-SOD), and manganese superoxide dismutase from E. coli (Mn-SOD) [257]. These enzymes were investigated
using a SAM of 3-mercaptopropionic acid on a gold electrode.

The electrochemical properties (formal potential, reversibility of
electrode reactions, kinetic parameters, and pH dependence) are
different for each SOD, suggesting the mechanisms of ET are not the
same. kET was calculated using Laviron’s method and showed the
fastest electron transfer for all three SODs occurred at a neutral pH.
5. Monolayer formation
The homogeneity of the SAM is of the utmost importance for
accurate measurements of kET , , and HAB . The SAM structure is signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by the method of SAM formation, choice of the
electrode material, terminal groups on the diluent, and attachment
of the redox center. The electrochemical techniques described in
Section 2 are highly sensitive to the integrity of the SAM. Here, we
describe SAM formation, types of SAM defects, SAM modiﬁcation,
and electrochemical characterization of SAM structures.
5.1. SAM structure
The spontaneous adsorption of thiols and disulﬁdes on gold to
form well-ordered SAMs was ﬁrst reported in the 1980s [258–268].

The formation of a SAM is often depicted in schemes as uniformly
aligned molecules on a ﬂat surface. However, it has been recognized that a wide variety of defects are possible such as pinholes,
collapsed sites, islands and domains (Fig. 5.1) [269]. Typically,
the ﬁrst assumption is that the metallic surface upon which the
SAM is formed is uniformly ﬂat. Scanning techniques show a variety of features such as terraces, steps, and crystalline boundaries
[270–277]. The choice of electrode metal is an important factor in determining the SAM integrity. While mercury is a liquid,
forming featureless, defect-free surfaces [278], the polycrystalline
surfaces of gold, silver, and other metals are prone to atomic
scale defects that can complicate SAM formation and ET measurements. A second assumption is that the organic molecules
of the SAM align uniformly. The tilt angle of alkane thiols can
cause signiﬁcant variation in the monolayer packing [279]. At
early stages of SAM formation, alkane thiols lay ﬂat across the
surface [270,280,281]. Over time, the majority of the monolayer
molecules equilibrate, and align with the molecular axis normal to
the surface. However, some of the chains remain ﬂat on the surface. Molecular vacancies in the monolayer are known as pinholes
[270].

A unique example of controlling SAM porosity takes advantage
of the reversible photoisomerization of azobenzene. The ferrocenylazobenzene functionality has been attached to an ITO electrode in
a variety of ways [290–293]. Upon UV irradiation, the interfacial
barrier between the solution and the ITO surface becomes more
compact. For a loosely packed SAM with a terminal ferrocene and
an azobenzene group on ITO, the Laviron approach was used to
determined the kET before(0.24 s−1 ) and after (0.11 s−1 ) UV irradiation (Fig. 5.3) [292]. The decrease in kET is attributed to the
change in the microenvironment around the ferrocene moiety in
the SAM corresponding to the trans-to-cis photoisomerization of
the azobenzene N–N bond. The porosity of the monolayer ﬁlm
decreases as well, as determined by the ability of the SAM to block
counterions [290,292].

[38].

5.2. Electrochemical assays for SAM defects
Electrochemical techniques are highly sensitive to nanometer
scale monolayer defects that are difﬁcult to discern using scanning
techniques (e.g., STM, AFM) [282,283]. Pinhole defects have been
identiﬁed electrochemically and modeled as an array of ultramicroelectrodes [103,273,284–286]. Ferrocene alkane thiols have been
used to electrochemically label fast exchange defect sites [283].
Lennox et al. have shown that cyclic voltammetry can be used to
electrochemically distinguish collapsed sites from pinhole defects
using a ferrocene label [287,288].
Cyclic voltammetry is most often used to interrogate the structure and dynamics of SAMs. A disordered SAM allows electrolyte
to approach the electrode surface, increasing the capacitive current
[37,43,289]. In one of the ﬁrst SAM ET studies, the capacitance of
hydroxyalkane thiol SAMs of varying chain lengths (from 2 to 16
methylene units) was examined [38]. Using cyclic voltammetry, it
was shown that the capacitance decreased as the number of methylene units increased, with capacitances ranging from 12.6 ␮F/cm2
for 2 methylene units to 1.36 ␮F/cm2 for 16 methylene units [38].
This result suggested that the monolayers were free from pinhole
defects (Fig. 5.2) [38].

5.3. Effects of SAM defects on electron transfer measurements
Monolayer defects give rise to a range of local environments in
which ET can occur, resulting in a distribution of observed rates,
known as kinetic dispersion or kinetic heterogeneity. The effect
of this distribution of rates on electrochemical response has been
computationally modeled [75,294]. Murray and coworkers have
reported a model of the effects of kinetic dispersion arising from
either a Gaussian distribution in the formal potentials E0 of surface
ferrocene sites, a distribution in the value of , or a distribution in
the tunneling distance [75]. Fitting Tafel plots derived from calculations incorporating a Gaussian distribution of E0 gives erroneously
low values of and high values for kET as compared to the values
expected for a homogeneous population of kinetic sites. According
to this model, a Gaussian distribution of s has a similar effect on
the appearance and analysis of the data.
If the distance between the redox sites and the electrode can
be described by a distribution of values, the observed CV peak
shape will not be ideal [295]. A mathematical model of this spatial inhomogeneity has been developed and indicates that broad,
asymmetric CV peak shapes will result [295]. Distributions of E0
and can arise from ion pairing, Fc–Fc interactions, or a distribution of monolayer structures corresponding to various solvation
shells. If these types of kinetic dispersion are present, kET , HAB and
cannot be determined accurately.
Pinhole defects can be quantiﬁed using electrochemical techniques that estimate the effective fractional surface coverage of a
monolayer, Â [296]. This value represents the area that is blocked

by the SAM and is therefore unavailable for electron transfer. A
fraction of the electrode surface area (1 − Â) is accessible to a redox

5.4. Formation of SAMs
Fig. 5.4. Bulky headgroups can interfere with formation of an ordered monolayer.

In many cases, the alkane thiol (or other bridge) is attached
to the redox species before the monolayer is formed [1,297]. This
attachment is frequently a synthetically accessible reaction such as
C–C bond, amide, or ester formation [45,195,298,299]. Defects are
typically avoided by using low concentrations (∼1 mM thiol), long
bridge lengths [1,266], long adsorption times [45,299,300], thermal
annealing procedures [76,83], annealing by multiple immersions or extended immersion in a second diluent-only solution
[3,70,83].
Typically, ferrocene-labeled SAMs are formed by exposing electrodes to dilute solutions of ferrocenyl alkane thiols (0.1 mM) and
diluent alkane thiols (1.0 mM thiol) [1,76,297,301]. The kET has been
measured for bridge lengths of 7–17 CH2 groups, various diluents,
and three different linkages between the ferrocene and the bridge
(C–C, ester, amide). The results are summarized in Table 1.1. The
utility of this approach is due to the solubility of ferrocene in organic
solvents, making it compatible with the alkane bridge.
The complex [Ru(NH3 )5 (4-AMP)]2+ has been peptide-coupled to
a carboxylic acid-terminated alkane thiol and used to form a SAM
[297]. While reproducible, this approach yielded monolayers that
showed multiple signals in the CV. A second peak was removed
by annealing procedures, and was attributed to the presence of
[Ru(II)(NH3 )4 (py)2 ] based on the redox potential. The electron
transfer parameters were evaluated, however this approach was
ultimately abandoned in favor of coupling the metal center to the
SAM after SAM formation (see Table 1.1, and Section 5.5).
The earliest report of incorporation of Os(II) into a SAM
uses [Os(bpy)2 (dipy)C1]+ (dipy = 4,4 -trimethylenedipyridine) CV
of these Os(II) SAMs on Pt electrodes indicates that ion-pair formation between perchlorate anions and the cationic head groups
strongly inﬂuences the energetics of the system. The Laviron
method was used to estimate the kET with a lower limit on the
order of 105 s−1 [302].
CV and the Laviron method were used to probe three different attachments of Os(II)(bpy) complexes to gold electrodes [303].
Alkane thiols of differing lengths (3, 11, and 16 CH2 groups) were
attached by an amide group to the Os(II) complex. Either a thiol or
an aryldiazonium group was used to bind to the gold surface. The
best ﬁt using the Laviron treatment for C11 and C16 (˛ = 0.5) gave
kET values of 1870 s−1 and 8 s−1 , respectively.
Direct comparison of a conjugated and saturated bridge has
been reported using [Os(bpy)2 (bpe)Cl]+ [304]. Despite the conjugated bridge and short electron transfer distance, the voltammetric
response is best modeled as a through-space tunneling process.
The kET for the conjugated bridge is 9.4 × 104 s−1 and is approximately a factor of 30 smaller than that observed for the saturated
bridge, 1,2-bis-(4-pyridinyl)ethane. The proposed reason for this
difference was attributed to the ﬂexibility of the saturated bridge
which allows the redox center in this system to move closer to the
electrode. In contrast, the conjugated bridge attaching the redox
center to the bridge is rigid, preventing close approach to the electrode. This results in a larger coupling and shorter distance for the
saturated system, leading to faster kET vs. the conjugated system
for the through-space ET reaction.

5.5. Attachment after SAM formation
Due to the synthetic challenge of attaching a redox center to an
alkane thiol, or the limited availability of redox-active species (i.e.,
metalloproteins), it may be desirable in some cases to covalently
attach a redox molecule to a monolayer that has already formed
[14,17,45,127,128,157,192,236,305–320]. If the terminal group is
bulky, coadsorption with a diluent has been shown to improve
packing (Fig. 5.4) [321–323]. There are two ways SAM attachment
can be accomplished: (1) incorporating a coordinating ligand into
the monolayer that binds to the metal center or (2) forming a
bond between a functional group on the monolayer surface and
a functional group on a ligand of the metal center. Both approaches
have been used to immobilize metalloproteins and small
molecule redox centers on SAMs [17,45,127,128,157,192,236,305,
312,314].
Several groups have reported using a terminal group of the SAM
as a metal binding ligand [221,312,314]. Van Ryswyk et al. utilized
the lability of H2 O in [Ru(NH3 )5 (H2 O)]2+ [314]. The aquo ligand was
replaced by terminal pyridine functionalities in a monolayer of 11mercaptoundecyl isonicotinamide [314]. The reaction was carried
out by soaking the monolayer-coated electrodes in a solution of
[Ru(NH3 )5 (H2 O)](PF6 )2 in THF under argon. Little or no substitution of the aquo ligand was observed if the soaking was done in
H2 O, however substantial substitution occurred in THF. A dissociative mechanism of substitution is suggested to explain this result.
After the loss of water, either reaquation or reaction with a pyridine group can occur. The use of a non-coordinating solvent such as
THF slows the reaquation process. Another explanation is that the
monolayer is more ﬂuid in THF than water, increasing the degrees
of freedom of the terminal pyridine groups to compete with the
reaquation process [312,314].
Ligand substitution of terminal pyridine or imidazole groups
with trans-[Ru(II)(NH3 )4 (SO3 )(H2 O)] has been used to attach the
ruthenium complex to a pre-formed SAM with a terminal pyridine
L1 (Fig. 5.5) [312]. This reaction can be carried out in a similar manner as described, except it can be performed in aqueous solutions
and is complete in 10–15 min. This step was followed by exposure
to H2 O2 to convert the SO3 ligand to SO4 and to oxidize the Ru(II)
center to Ru(III). Electrochemical reduction of this complex results
in the formation of trans-[Ru(II)(NH3 )4 (H2 O)(L1 )]-SAMs. The labile
aquo ligand of these redox-modiﬁed SAMs can be substituted with
a variety of N-heterocyclic ligands L2 .
One explanation for the high yield of formation of trans[Ru(II)(NH3 )4 (SO3 )(L1 )] in aqueous solutions is that since the
trans-[Ru(II)(NH3 )4 (SO3 )(H2 O)] is a neutral complex, it can more
easily associate with the hydrophobic monolayer interface than can
the charged complex [Ru(NH3 )5 (H2 O)]2+ . Electron transfer kinetic
experiments for redox-modiﬁed monolayers formed using these
types of substitution reactions show rates of electron transfer that
are comparable to monolayers formed using a mixture of redoxmodiﬁed and diluent alkane thiols.

A SAM was modiﬁed with trans-[Ru(III)(NH3 )4 (SO4 )(L)] (where
L = histidine) by the reaction of a carboxylic acid-terminated monolayer with the histidine amine and EDC [312]. Experiments showed
electron transfer rates similar to monolayers formed using redoxmodiﬁed alkane thiols, but a rate for electron transfer was not
reported.
Covalently attaching a redox molecule to a monolayer postformation has been successfully applied in a number of cases
[45,157,192]. A popular approach is to use peptide coupling procedures, in which a carboxylic acid is conjugated to a primary amine
using a peptide coupling reagent such as EDC. An example of this
approach was used in the formation of monolayers of differing
lengths of mercaptocarboxylic acids modiﬁed with [Ru(NH3 )5 (4AMP)]2+ [45]. The peptide coupling reaction was performed by
soaking the mercaptocarboxylic acid monolayer-coated electrode
in a solution of EDC and [Ru(NH3 )5 (4-AMP)]2+ .
Ferrocene has been attached to SAMs through either an amide
or an alkyl bond and kET measured to compare the effect of these
two types of bond on ET [84]. For an identical number of bonds, it
was found that kET for ferrocene linked by an amide bond linkage is
nearly identical to kET for ferrocene linked by an alkyl bond [82,84].
Covalent attachment of [Os(II)(bpy)2 (4-AMP)(H2 O)]2+ to
mixed monolayers of 16-mercaptohexadecanoic acid and either
12-mercaptododecanol or 16-mercaptohexadecanol has been
reported [157,192] (Fig. 5.6). The peptide coupling was performed
by placing the pre-formed mixed monolayer in a solution of the
osmium complex and EDC in either pH 7 phosphate buffer or
acetonitrile with a few drops of water. These Os(II) complexes
were used to study the pH dependence of ET (Section 4.2). At pH
7.2, the kET was found to be 9.9 s−1 .
Besides peptide coupling, another method for attaching redox
species to a pre-formed monolayer which has been explored is
“click” chemistry [127] (Fig. 5.7). After forming mixed monolayers consisting of azidoundecanethiol and decanethiol as diluent,
the modiﬁed electrodes were placed in solutions of alkynyl ferrocene, copper(II) sulfate and sodium ascorbate. The reaction time
was found to be on the order of minutes [128]. In addition, by varying the lengths of the functionalized and diluent alkane thiols, the
authors showed that kET could be tuned from 1 s−1 to 60,000 s−1 .
The triazole linkage provides good electronic coupling between the
ferrocene and the alkane thiol, similar to that for ester linkages
[305]. A fast reaction time and well-behaved redox chemistry make
these “clicked” ferrocene SAMs useful for a wide variety of electron
transfer studies.

6. Bridge and diluent
The bridge is a key component of SAMs, controlling the distance
between the electrode and the redox center, and thereby controlling the HAB and kET (Fig. 1.1). Long length bridges are typically
used in order to slow the electron transfer rate to a measurable
value. The structure of the bridge is key to controlling the electronic coupling and this factor is evaluated in terms of the decay
constant ˇ given by Eq. (6.1), where A is a preexponential factor,
and d is the bridge length. Saturated and conjugated bridges have
been investigated as well as functional bridges such as peptides
[1,3,78,353].

6.1. Alkane bridges
Alkane thiols on gold are the most common type of monolayer
that has been studied due to their stability and ease of preparation
[21,269,324]. Not surprisingly, long-chain alkane thiols have been
shown to form well-packed, highly ordered monolayers superior to
those formed from short alkane thiols. The van der Waals interactions within the monolayer are stronger for the more hydrophobic
long-chain alkane thiols and weaker for short chain alkane thiols [324]. Another factor is solubility; long-chain alkane thiols are
less soluble in the solvents generally used for monolayer depositions, and it is energetically more favorable for them to pack closely
together to form a well-ordered monolayer [260,301].
As predicted by theory, kET decreases as the length of alkane
thiols increases [301]. For example, kET between a ferrocene bound
to a monolayer with a series of alkyl bridges (5–13 methylene units)
and a gold electrode was found to vary from 102 s−1 for the longest
alkyl chain, to 3 × 107 s−1 for the shortest alkyl chain [300].
In general, the decay constant, ˇ, for electron transfer through
alkane thiols on gold has been measured to be approximately
1.1 per methylene unit (Eq. (6.1)) [42,81,299,300]. The tunneling constant varies, however, with respect to the position of the
redox species in relation to the diluent. This was demonstrated for
monolayers with series of [Ru(NH3 )5 pyCH2 NHCO(CH2 )n SH]2+/3+
complexes with diluent HS(CH2 )m COOH in which n = m, n > m (the
ruthenium was exposed to the bulk solution), and n < m (the ruthenium was buried in the monolayer) [76]. For the n = m case, ˇ is 0.97.
For the n > m case, ˇ is 0.83. For the n < m case, ˇ is 0.16 per methylene. This variation in tunneling constants is indicative of different
electron tunneling paths through the monolayer depending upon
the position of the redox species relative to the diluent species of
the monolayer.
In another study it was found that if one of the internal bonds of
an alkane thiol monolayer is an alkene or alkyne, the rate of electron
transfer through the monolayer decreases. This result is attributed
to a decrease in HAB [325]. HAB between the redox species and the
electrode is dependent upon the overlap of the ␴ and ␴* orbitals of
the individual atoms in the hydrocarbon chain of the bridge with
the orbitals of the nearest neighboring 2-3 atoms [40,326–329].
Interrupting this ␴ and ␴* orbital overlap within the bridge by
an alkene or alkyne results in two, long, through-space interac-

tions. The result is a less effective electronic coupling pathway as
compared to unmodiﬁed alkane thiol bridges [325].
One important, and subtle aspect of alkane thiols SAMs is
whether there is an odd or even number of methylene units in the
alkyl chain (Fig. 6.1). Alkane thiols on gold exhibit a tilt angle of ∼30◦
deﬁned with respect to the surface normal, regardless of the chain
length [266]. Due to this tilt angle, the terminal CH3 –CH2 bond is
perpendicular to the electrode surface for CH3 (CH2 )n S–Au where
n is odd. The surface for these SAMs consists of methyl groups.
For CH3 (CH2 )n S–Au where n is even, the terminal CH3 –CH2 bond
is tilted with respect to the normal of the electrode surface, thus
the surface consists of both the methyl and methylene groups [279].
For alkane thiol monolayers on electrodes other than gold, the
tilt angle tends to decrease as the chain length increases. The decay
constant for superexchange (tunneling) is affected by the tilt angle
of the alkyl chains in the monolayer, and is not a constant 1.2 per
methylene unit [330]. As a result of the difference in structures,

Fig. 6.1. An illustration of the odd–even effect on the SAM structure. For n = odd, the
terminal CH3 –CH2 group is parallel to the surface normal. For n = even, the terminal
CH3 –CH2 group is tilted with respect to the surface normal. Adapted from Ref. [279].

SAMs with an odd number of methylene units show slightly slower
electron transfer rates than SAMs an even number of methylene
units [73,84]. The odd–even effect in SAMs has been widely investigated and a review focusing on this topic has recently appeared
[279].
6.2. Functional groups
The most common terminal functional groups employed in
SAMs on gold include: –CH3 , –OH, and –COOH (Fig. 6.2a). Methyl
terminated SAMs were discussed in the previous section. Hydroxylterminated SAMs have been found to have a tilt angle of 28◦ ,
similar to alkane thiols [331]. Compared to alkane thiol SAMs, it
has been found that hydroxyl-terminated SAMs are slightly more
defective and permeable, despite the fact that the terminal –OH
provides a more favorable interface with water [37]. The decay
constant ˇ has been determined to be 0.9 per methylene unit for
hydroxyl-terminated SAMs, similar to the value for alkane thiols
[37]. In addition, introducing a polar group to the surface of a monolayer affects the apparent formal potential and apparent kET . An
increased double-layer capacitance in the CVs of these monolayers
causes the kET values to appear slightly lower than they actually are
[73] (Table 6.2).

Acid-terminated monolayers have been shown to be more
permeable to water and aqueous ions and have more defects
than hydroxyl-terminated monolayers [37]. This behavior is due
to hydrogen bond formation between the terminal COOH moieties before the monolayer forms well-ordered close-packed SAMs
(due to the hydrophobic interactions of the alkyl chains) [324].
The tilt angle was found to be 32◦ , similar to –CH3 and –OH
terminated SAMs [331]. Despite their disorder and permeability,
acid-terminated SAMs can be easily modiﬁed chemically after the
monolayer has been formed, an attractive property of this class of
SAM [45,157,192].
In addition to amides, acids can be converted to esters. It has
been shown that there is some degree of disorder in monolayers
with ester functionality [314]. The tilt angle for these monolayers
was measured to be 35◦ [314]. Ester hydrolysis measurements have
been performed, and the rate for the reaction on monolayers was
found to occur, but was signiﬁcantly slower for monolayer esters
than for esters in solution.
6.3. Conjugated bridges
Molecules that are highly conjugated and conduct large
currents via fast electron transfer between contacts are
referred to as molecular wires [332]. The most studied
molecular wires are oligo(phenyleneethynylenes) (OPEs) and
oligo(phenylenevinylenes) (OPVs) (Fig. 6.2b) [21,324]. Monolayers
incorporating these moieties were found to have similar ordering
as alkane thiols with slightly smaller tilt angles, due to the rigidity
of the system and the bulkiness of the phenyl rings [269].
As the number of phenyl rings increases in OPEs, the overall
order of the monolayer structure increases [333]. The ˇ for OPE
SAMs was found to be between 0.36 and 0.57 Å−1 [3,254]. This value
is intermediate between saturated systems and conjugated systems
(ˇ = 0.2 for polyenes) [334,335]. For a monolayer consisting of six
phenylethynyl units, kET was found to be 350 s−1 using the ACV
method [3].
For OPE systems, kET was measured using ILIT and the ACV
method and found to be independent of the diluent [57]. Conversely, when OPE is the diluent, it has no effect on kET through

alkane thiol bridges [57]. The kET between ferrocene and a gold
electrode through an OPE monolayer is dependent upon the conformation of the molecule [57]. This conformational dependence
has been attributed to the fact that there is a low barrier to for
phenylene rotation about the ethynyl bonds, reducing the conjugation of the system [45,57]. This dependence explains why the
tunneling decay constant is an intermediate value between the
decay constants for saturated monolayers and conjugated systems.
For similar molecules, the rates measured using ILIT are significantly different from the rates measured using the ACV method
[3]. It was suggested that the AC signals may be inaccurate due
to the cell time constant Ru Cﬁlm where Ru is the uncompensated
solution resistance. Further, the surface coverage used in the ACV
measurements is much lower than in the ILIT measurements.
OPVs are expected to be more conjugated than OPEs because
phenyl rotation is less likely in these types of systems [336,337].
In general OPVs have fast kET s, greater than 104 s−1 , for molecules
longer than 35 Å due to their highly conjugated nature [336]. These
fast electron transfer rates show that coupling between the redox
center and the electrode is not a limiting factor for ET through
OPVs up to 28 Å in length [44]. The large coupling prevents the
measurement of changes in kET with increasing monolayer thicknesses (longer OPVs), making the mechanism for ET (hopping vs.
tunneling) through OPVs ambiguous [44,338].
To determine the appropriate mechanism, measurement of the
energy levels of the HOMO of the donor and the LUMO of the OPV
were performed [20,338]. For an electron to be injected into the
OPV (a hopping mechanism), the energy of the HOMO of the donor
must overlap with the energy of the LUMO of the OPV. For a system
in which Fc was covalently attached to an OPV, energy level measurements showed a large energy gap between the HOMO of Fc and
the HOMO and LUMO of OPV. This allowed the authors to rule out a
hopping mechanism and determine that ET for this system occurred
by a tunneling mechanism [338]. For a system in solution in which
a tetracene donor was connected to a pyromellitimide acceptor by
an OPV bridge, the energy of the HOMO of the donor was found to
be similar to the LUMO of the OPV. In this case, ET was determined
to occur by a hopping mechanism [20,338]. As both tunneling and
hopping mechanisms have been shown to occur, knowing the relative energy levels of the donor/acceptor and the bridge is important
in these types of conjugated systems [20].
For long OPVs in solution, a temperature dependence on the
kET has been observed due to torsional motions of the molecule
[339]. These torsional motions decrease overlap between the ␲
orbitals of the OPV. Decreased overlap slows kET , and the result is
conformational gating of ET for OPV systems in solution. Although
conformational gating is signiﬁcant for OPVs in solution, there is
little conformational change in OPV monolayers and kET is not signiﬁcantly slowed for these systems.
Recently, a series of norbornane-based monolayers has been
studied (Fig. 6.2c) [86,102,340–342]. For a norbornylogous bridge

21.3 Å long (Fig. 6.2c), the kET from a ferrocene attached by 18 bonds
to the electrode was found to be faster than expected: three times
faster than for an alkane thiol of the same length [102,341]. Despite
this faster rate, the mechanism of electron transfer through the norbornylogous SAM was found to occur by nonresonant tunneling
[342].
Early versions of the norbornylogous bridges were found to have
a high amount of curvature [341,342]. The curvature depends on
the length or how many norbornyl units are used. Shorter versions
have been synthesized such that the curvature is negligible. These
monolayers have been found to have a tilt angle of approximately
30◦ with a ˇ value of 0.80 Å−1 [340].
6.4. Peptide bridges
Long-range ET through proteins has received signiﬁcant
attention due to the importance of ET in biological processes [27,28,30–33,106,214,246,343]. The majority of this work
has utilized ﬂash photolysis approach to determining ET
[30,65,106,344–352]. These studies have shown that the efﬁciency
of the coupling between redox centers is determined by the 3D
structure of the intervening peptide matrix. The protein structure is the fundamental regulator of ET, controlling G, , and
the HAB [247]. Only recently have electrochemical methods been
used to study ET through (relatively) short peptides on SAMs
[78–80,353–358].
A number of leucine-rich ferrocene-terminated helical peptide
SAMs on gold have been examined [78–80,355,357,358]. In general,
vertical orientation and tighter packing of the monolayer appears
to suppress the electron transfer rates. The observed electron transfer appears to occur intermolecularly and may be associated with
molecular motion [79,80]. Three mechanisms are proposed: (1)
electron tunneling gated by a helix contraction, (2) electron tunneling coupled with helix conversion from R-helix to 310 -helix, and (3)
electron hopping along the backbone via the amide groups (Fig. 6.4).
Mandal and Kraatz have studied the effects of the peptide
helix dipole moment on ET using leucine-rich ferrocenyl peptides
[354]. SAMs were formed in which either the dipole moments
of the peptides were aligned or were in opposition. Reﬂection absorption infrared spectroscopy (RAIRS) revealed that the
dipole-opposed peptides are more vertically oriented than the
dipole-aligned peptides. Importantly, the ET properties are signiﬁcantly different, rationalized by differences in the molecular
dynamics of the two ﬁlms. The kET was determined from CV
data using the Butler–Volmer methodology. The dipole-opposed
SAM exhibited a much slower kET than in the dipole-aligned SAM
(kET = 1.2 × 10−3 s−1 vs. 1.5 × 10−2 s−1 ).
Mixed SAMs of oligoglycine derivatives (FcCO(Gly)n
NH(CH2 )2 SH/CH3 (CH2 )X SH) (n = 2–6) were assembled on gold
and investigated using CV and ACV methods [356]. The rates
of electron transfer through these bridges decrease rapidly with

distance for short chain derivatives, with kET ranging from 9000 s−1
to 1 s−1 . A less pronounced distance dependence is observed for
longer bridges (n ≥ 5). Differences in the secondary structure of the
peptide bridges or a change in the ET mechanism from tunneling
to hopping are considered as possible reasons for the difference of
the rate constants.
Ferrocenyl groups were attached to a cyclodecapeptide
(designed for anion sensing) and immobilized on a gold electrode [359]. Using CV, the Laviron method was applied only to
the cathodic branch of the Ep vs.
plot (only for overpotentials
higher than 0.1 V) as the anodic wave became indistinguishable at
scan rates >100 V/s. The kET was found to be 6350 ± 2000 s−1 and
˛ = 0.2 ± .05. The redox potential shifts dramatically in the presence
of phosphate anion in acetonitrile.
A peptide sequence with alternating glutamic acid and leucine
amino acids (HELELELELELC) was modiﬁed with a Ru(NH3 )5 group
at the histidine end and used to form SAM on gold via the
cysteine at the other end [360]. The peptide was designed to
have a pH-dependent secondary structure, allowing the study of
structure-dependent ET. At low pH the carboxylic acid groups are
protonated and the peptide has a compact helical structure. At
high pH, the carboxylic acid groups are deprotonated leading to
an extended conformation due to the electrostatic interactions
between carboxylate groups. The pH-sensitive conformation of the
peptide was predicted by molecular dynamics simulations and conﬁrmed by electrochemical measurement. The electron transfer is
fast at low pH values (78 s−1 , 110 s−1 , and 230 s−1 at pH 3.0, 2.0,
and 1.0, respectively). The kET decreases gradually as the pH is
increased, and is completely suppressed at pH 6.9.
Short ferrocenoyl-peptide cystamines were used to form poorly
packed SAMs with a uniform thickness of 7 Å [353]. 10–15% of the
Au surface is exposed as determined by Cu underpotential deposition [353]. The kET values were estimated using the Butler–Volmer
formalism and are in the range of (5–8) × 103 s−1 . Diluting the
monolayer with hexanethiol resulted in faster redox kinetics. This
was attributed to a “stiffening” of the monolayer.

coworkers report a conformational gating effect using ferrocene
attached to ss DNA in which the DNA bends such that the ferrocene
can closely approach the electrode surface [369,370].
Peptide nucleic acid (PNA) oligomers provide an attractive alternative for examining nucleic acids in SAMs. PNA strands are based
on an aminoethylglycine backbone (Fig. 6.5) and form duplexes via
Watson–Crick hydrogen bonding. The backbone is neutral, providing an advantage for surface studies in that the strands do not repel
each other on the surface.
SAMs of single-stranded PNAs (ssPNAs) containing 3 to 7
thymine (T) nucleotides, a C-terminus cysteine, and an N-terminus
ferrocene group were formed on gold electrodes[135]. The ˇ for
these SAMs was determined to be about 0.9/Å. The kET ranges from
2000 s−1 for 3 bases to 0.02 s−1 for 7 bases.
SAMs of ssPNAs with the sequence T3-X-T3 were investigated
for X = C, T, A, G, CH3 (Fig. 6.5). The charge transfer rate constants
for these SAMs depend on the identity of the nucleobase X ranging
from 0.014 s−1 to 0.067 s−1 [136]. The CH3 group gave the slowest
rate of charge transfer (<0.005 s−1 ). Computational studies were
undertaken and indicate that charge transfer through the PNA SAMs
occurs by hole-mediated superexchange. A correlation between the
charge transfer rate constant and the oxidation potential of X was
noted [136].
Recently, charge transfer in PNA SAMs consisting of either ss
Cys–Tn–Fc, ss Cys–An–Fc, or ds Cys–(AT)n–Fc were studied using
CV [372]. For short ssPNA SAMs, the charge transfer rate decreased
rapidly with increasing PNA length according to a superexchangemediated tunneling mechanism. For long ss and dsPNAs, the charge
transfer rate had a weaker distance dependence and correlated
with the oxidation potential of the nucleobases, indicating that a
hopping mechanism occurs [372]. This PNA length-dependent transition between the superexchange and hopping mechanisms can
be rationalized by the tight-binding model proposed by Ratner and
coworkers [373].

6.5. Nucleic acid bridges

The choice of electrode material is important to the measurement of kET due to the implication of the density of electronic states
in Marcus theory. The most widely used electrode metals for thiolbased SAMs ET measurements are gold and silver. However, the
formation of SAMs on other metals such as nickel, copper, palladium, mercury and platinum has been investigated. Thiols have
a high afﬁnity for these metals and form densely packed monolayers. However, few reports exist in which ET kinetics have been
directly compared for SAMs on these metal surfaces. Finally, semiconducting materials have been examined as substrates for SAM
kET measurements [292,374,375].

Charge transfer in DNA has been widely investigated [361]. A
number of electrochemical studies of ET in DNA using SAMs have
been undertaken [6,9,362–370]. Meade and coworkers covalently
attached metal complexes into DNA [9,10,138,371] and developed
a sensitive electronic detection system for point mutations based
on site-speciﬁc incorporation of ferrocenyl derivatives into DNA
oligonucleotides [6,362,363]. Barton and coworkers have used the
intercalating organic redox species daunomycin and methylene
blue either covalently or noncovalently attached to DNA in SAMs.
The results are sensitive to perturbations in the DNA structure and
suggest that base stacking is required for charge transfer in these
systems [364–366]. Using ferrocene-terminated ds DNA (20 base
pairs), Kraatz and coworkers report a charge transfer rate of 25 s−1
if the ferrocene is on the 3 end of the complimentary strand and
115 s−1 if it is on the 5 end of the DNA strand attached to the electrode via the alkane thiol bridge [368]. The authors conclude that
there is either an energetic barrier to interstrand crossing or the 5
Fc is more accessible to the base pairs than the 3 Fc [368]. Anne and

7. Electrode materials

7.1. Effects of electrode material—theory and experiment
The theoretical effect of the density of electronic states (DOS) at
the Fermi level of a metal (Pt and Au) on kET has been examined by
Gosavi and Marcus [376]. kET was calculated for the electron transfer through alkane thiol SAMs on either Pt or Au. The s electrons
dominate the DOS for metals such as gold and silver. The DOS near
the Fermi energy is a factor of 7.5 higher for Pt than for Au however,

due to the overlap of the d band states with the Fermi energy in Pt.
The electronic coupling per state is signiﬁcantly weaker for the d
band states as compared to the sp band states. This difference is
likely because the d band states are more localized and therefore
are only weakly coupled to the redox centers in the SAM.
Finklea et al. has used a Ru(NH3 )5 SAM to investigate kET on
Au, Pt, and Ag for comparison to Gosavi’s theoretical treatment
[377]. Using CA to generate Tafel plots, the kET was compared for Au
(1.0 s−1 ), Ag (0.6 s−1 ), and Pt (1.7 s−1 ). The ratio of kPt/kAu (1.7) was
found to be signiﬁcantly lower than the predicted 7.5 predicted by
the ratio of DOS near the Fermi energy. The difference between Ag
and Au is in agreement with the electronic heat constants, which
are proportional to the density of states near the Fermi energy (0.65
for Ag and 0.73 for Au) [71]. The results are in good agreement with
the theoretical prediction that the d band states are only weakly
coupled to the Ru(NH3 )5 centers.
SAMs of [Os(OMe-bpy)2 (p3p)Cl]+ were formed on carbon-ﬁber,
Hg, Pt, Au, Cu, and Ag microelectrodes (OMe-bpy = 4,4 -dimethoxy2,2 -bipyridine; p3p = 4,4 -trimethylenedipyridine) and studied
electrochemically to investigate how the DOS inﬂuences kET
[378]. CA was used to generate Tafel plots for each electrode material. Fig. 7.1 shows the best ﬁts using Marcus DOS
theory. The reorganization energy is 0.27 eV and the kET is
4.0 × 104 s−1 , 1.8 × 104 s−1 , and 3 × 103 s−1 for Pt, Au, and carbon,
respectively.
The experimental preexponential factors are consistent with
weak electronic coupling between the delocalized metallic states
on the electrode and the localized redox states of the osmium complex. The ratio of the prefactors for platinum and gold is 2.9 ± 0.7
compared with the DOS ratio of 7.5. This ratio is higher than the
ratio of the kET values for the Ru(NH3 )5 case, and conﬁrms that the
relationship of the electron transfer with the electrode DOS is not
a simple linear relationship.

Defects in alkane thiol SAMs on Hg have been studied using a
variety of methods. Using hexadecanethiol, Demox et al. report high
density SAMs that are impermeable to Ru(NH3 )6 3+ [278]. Potentialinduced ion gating attributed to SAM defects are reported [294]. A
C60 -alkane thiol monolayer on a Hg ﬁlm electrode showed electrochemical blocking of redox species in solution and a high degree
of hydrophobicity [175]. SECM was used to evaluate pinholes in
a SAM of alkane thiols of different chain lengths (CH3 (CH2 )n SH;
n = 8, 10, 11, 15) on Au and Hg surfaces using FcCH2 NHCO(CH2 )12 SH
and ferrocene-terminated poly-norbornyl (FcNB) thiols [102]. Pinholes were identiﬁed by the growth of Pd nanoparticles. A model
was developed for the correction of kET for the presence of pinholes [102]. The FcNB species gave a kET of 189 s−1 similar to
FcCH2 NHCO(CH2 )12 SH of the same length.

7.2. Mercury

7.4. Nickel

Mercury is liquid at room temperature which offers the advantage of providing a featureless defect-free surface. Mercury has
a higher afﬁnity toward thiols than the other metals and form
tightly packed SAMs that block both hydrophilic and hydrophobic redox probes [278]. A number of studies have investigated the
heterogeneous kET through a SAM to a redox species in solution
[278,294,379,380]. Few studies have been undertaken to measure kET of a redox-active SAM on mercury. In one case, attempts
to form SAMs of HO2 C(CH2 )15 SH on Hg followed by coupling
to [Ru(NH3 )5 (4-AMP)]2+ were unsuccessful [377]. The authors
observed formation of multilayers of HO2 C(CH2 )15 SH rather than
SAMs, a peak attributed to desorption of the thiol at −0.6 V vs. SCE,
and non-ideal behavior of the Ru(II/III) couple.

Thiols on Ni form homogeneous monolayers as ascertained by
XPS, Auger electron spectroscopy, and electrochemical surface coverage [384,385]. At ambient pressure and temperature, Ni forms an
oxide layer that must be removed prior to SAM formation. Mekhalif
et al. reported a two-step procedure involving electroreduction of
the oxide layer immediately followed by immersion in an alkane
thiol solution. However, exposure to atmosphere between steps
allows some oxide to form [386]. In a more recent report, electroreduction concurrent with SAM formation on Ni surfaces was
demonstrated using basic solutions saturated with alkane thiol
[387]. The optimal applied potential for electroreduction of NiO was
determined by measuring the surface coverage of Fc(CH2 )11 SH on
electroreduced samples [388].

7.3. Silver and copper
In the case of Ag and Cu, well-ordered SAMs can be formed on
freshly evaporated ﬁlms that are handled in an inert atmosphere
[381]. The tilt angle of alkane thiols on Ag and Cu surfaces is smaller
than the tilt angle for SAMs on gold, and no odd–even effects have
been observed.
In contrast to gold, an oxide layer forms on these metals upon
exposure to air. Alkane thiol SAMs form on these oxidized surfaces,
however they differ in structure and properties from SAMs formed
on less oxidized surfaces. It has been shown that a redox reaction
takes place between the metal oxide and the alkane thiol molecules
[382,383]. The alkane thiols are oxidized to sulfonates accompanying reduction of silver and copper oxides [382,383]. These reduced
surfaces react with a second equivalent of alkane thiol to form the
SAM. Copper has not been reported for ET SAM studies. Silver is
widely used for SERRS and numerous examples of metalloprotein
kET measurements using SAMs on silver are given in Section 4.3.

A.L. Eckermann et al. / Coordination Chemistry Reviews 254 (2010) 1769–1802

7.5. Palladium
For SAMs on crystalline Pd, the alkane chains are conformationally disordered for short chain lengths and are dense and crystalline
at long chain lengths, similar to monolayer ordering on Ag and Au
[389]. Alkane thiol SAMs provide Pd with a resistance to corrosion
that is independent of the alkane chain length [390]. XPS data reveal
a complex palladium sulﬁde interphase that appears to enhance the
SAM stability against corrosion [389,391]. The potential of reductive desorption of alkane thiols on Pd does not change signiﬁcantly
with the hydrocarbon chain length, unlike Au, Ag, Pt, and Ni which
do not have an analogous metal–sulﬁde interphase [392].
OEG-terminated SAMs on palladium are resistant to nonspeciﬁc adsorption of proteins and the adhesion of mammalian cells
[393]. Patterned OEG-SAMs resisted the invasion of cells for over
four weeks while SAMs on gold remained patterned for only two
weeks under the same conditions [393]. SAMs on palladium may
be better for microcontact printing [394].
Palladium surfaces of high roughness have been deposited on
glassy carbon electrodes from a variety of electrolytes (alkaline,
neutral, and acidic) using two palladium chloride complexes (PdCl2
and Na2 PdCl4 ) [395]. Decanethiol and butanethiol SAMs on these
Pd surfaces block the redox reaction of species in solution. Importantly, the hydrogen evolution reaction is suppressed.
7.6. Semiconductors
High stability monolayers on silicon may be formed through
hydrosilation chemistry due to the strength of the Si–C bond,
which affords much greater stability that the analogous monolayers
formed with gold–sulfur linkages [396]. Electronically passivating
a silicon surface using the native oxide layer that typically forms
is useful, but cannot be readily modiﬁed for speciﬁc applications.
However, organic monolayers have the potential to serve as passivators that may be speciﬁcally tailored. As of 1999, the surface
chemistry of silicon material has remained largely unexplored [2].
However, understanding the surface chemistry of silicon is crucial
to the rapid development of microdevices [397].
The electronic structure of the electrode inﬂuences the properties of the electrochemical interface and affects electrochemical
reactions. Semiconductors possess current-carrying bands that do
not overlap (as is the case for metals) and are separated by a band
gap [71]. Semiconductor band gaps are typically on the order of
0.5–2 eV, rendering the conductivity quite low [71]. Enhancement
of the conductivity of semiconductors can be achieved through
doping. A potential difference occurs at the interface between a
semiconductor surface and an electrolyte due to a difference in conductivity between the semiconductor (low conductivity), and the
electrolyte solution (relatively high conductivity). A consequence
of this difference in conductivity is that the potential drop primarily
occurs at the boundary layer of the electrode and not at the solution
side of the interface [68].
Potential drop characteristics at semiconductor interfaces are
opposite to that observed on metal electrodes [68]. A variation
in the electrostatic potential of a semiconductor results in band
bending. A fundamental difference between ET reactions on metals compared to semiconductors is that for a metal the variation
of the electrode potential varies with the molar Gibbs energy of
the reaction. As the electrode potential is varied for a semiconductor the positions of the band edges at the semiconductor surface
do not change with respect to the solution due to intrinsic low
conductivity of the semiconductor [68].
Hybrid molecule/silicon assemblies offer two predominant
advantages over analogous assemblies on gold surfaces. First,
electronic properties of silicon are easily modiﬁed by selecting
an appropriate dopant and dopant concentration or via genera-

1795

tion of electron–hole pairs under illumination. Second, superior
stability is afforded by interfacial Si–C and Si–O bonds as compared to Au–S bond between gold and alkane thiol adsorbates
[398–400]. Si(1 1 1) surfaces can be formed with atomically ﬂat
monohydride-terminated reactive surfaces that can be further
modiﬁed [401–403].
There is intense interest in controlling interface properties
for applications such as sensors and biologically active surfaces
[21,269]. Probing biomolecular interactions at conductive and
semiconductive surfaces by impedance spectroscopy has been
reviewed [91]. Through immobilization of biomaterials such as
enzymes, antigens/antibodies, or DNA on electrodes or semiconductor surfaces the capacitance and interfacial electron transfer
resistance can be modulated. Impedance spectroscopy is used to
investigate interfacial changes as a result of biorecognition event
occurring at the surface of an electrode [91].
Ferrocene and zinc(II) trimesitylporphyrins have been tethered
to a Si(1 0 0) surface via a benzyl alcohol linker [374]. For the Zn porphyrin monolayer, ET rates for oxidation were found to be similar
analogous thiol-derivatized Zn porphyrin on Au surfaces. However,
ferrocene monolayers on Si(1 0 0) surfaces exhibited a slower kET
than the corresponding alkane thiol on gold. These observations
were attributed to changes in distance of the redox centers from
the surface, modulated by orientation of the linking chains [374].
The effects of varying anchor (O, S, Se) and linker on electron
transfer characteristics of two classes of Zn porphyrin tethered
monolayers on Si(1 0 0) surface were investigated [375]. To examine these monolayers XPS, FTIR, and electrochemical methods were
used. Surface binding to Si(1 0 0) can be achieved with short (benzyl) and very short (methylene) linkers independent of anchoring
atom. The orientations of these porphyrins were controlled by the
choice of linker molecule. A benzyl tether affords the porphyrin a
more “upright” geometry with respect to the surface as compared
to a methylene tether. kET was found to be signiﬁcantly faster for
the methylene linker and dependent on surface coverage (104 s−1
to 105 s−1 for
= (0.25–3) × 10−11 mol/cm2 ). The identity of the
anchor did not change kET appreciably.
Vinylferrocene was anchored to monocrystalline Si(1 0 0) surface via a Si–C bond [404]. XPS and capacitance–voltage studies
were described, but kET was not determined. Si(1 1 1) surfaces have
been modiﬁed with ferrocene-terminated alkane monolayers [87].
Ferrocene was coupled to a carboxylic acid-terminated C11 chain.
The surface coverage of the ferrocene species was controlled by
diluting with inert n-decyl chains. The kET was found to be independent of surface coverage of the ferrocene redox centers at 50 s−1 .
7.7. Indium tin oxide (ITO)
Indium tin oxide (ITO) is a transparent conducting material,
making it attractive as a substrate to study photoreactive electrochemical processes such as artiﬁcial photosynthesis systems
[182,405]. However, few studies have been undertaken to electrochemically determine kET of an ITO-bound redox center.
A ferrocenyl trichlorosilane has been synthesized and attached
to semiconductor electrodes consisting of indium tin oxide (ITO),
zinc indium tin oxide (ZITO), cadmium oxide (CdO), and ITO
derived from ion-beam deposition (IAD ITO) [406]. The ITO was
chemically pretreated in different ways to examine the effects
on the electrochemistry. The greatest ferrocene surface coverage
(7.9 × 10−10 mol/cm2 ) coincides with the greatest observed electron transfer rate (9.23 s−1 ) for O2 plasma-treated ITO. CV showed
the largest Ep and FWHM for IAD-In2 O3 suggesting that the SAM
on this surface is more disordered than the others.
Laviron’s method was used to calculate the kET (s−1 ): 7.12
(ZITO) > 6.6 (as-received ITO) > 5.07 (IAD ITO) > 0.42 (CdO) > 0.03
(IAD-In2 O3 ). The electron transfer rate of IAD-In2 O3 is nearly 2

1796

A.L. Eckermann et al. / Coordination Chemistry Reviews 254 (2010) 1769–1802

orders of magnitude less than the kET of the as-received ITO, which
may be due the relatively low conductivity of 1000 S/cm. The carrier mobility is lower in semiconducting electrodes versus that in
commonly used metal electrodes. Therefore, a signiﬁcant lag in the
potential is expected to occur between the voltage source and the
electrode surface. All surface sites experience this lag, shifting the
CV peaks to more extreme potentials, giving the CV a stretched
appearance compared to electroactive SAMs on noble metal electrodes.
8. Modeling of SAM structure
Experimental preparation of monolayers on a metal surface by
self-assembly was ﬁrst reported by Zisman and coworkers in 1946
[407]. As early as 1966, theoretical studies were carried out on
mono- and bilayers using Monte Carlo (MC) methods motivated
largely by interest in the structure and properties of biological
membranes [408–414]. Current computational studies of SAMs
are directed towards understanding the fundamental process of
self-organization, interfacial phenomena and structure–function
relationships, and charge transport in SAMs as related to molecular
electronics [360,415–419].
SAM structure has been shown to have an impact on electrochemical measurements. Engineering nanoscale features of
surfaces requires intimate knowledge of structure. This section
focuses on modeling the structure of SAMs. These model systems
focus on mechanisms of annealing, tilt angle, odd–even, and head
group effects.
8.1. Early work—molecular dynamics
Due to growth of large supercomputers in the late 1970s and
early 1980s, the application of computer methods such as MC and
molecular dynamics (MD) to large multiparticle systems has grown
rapidly. The ﬁrst reports of using MD to study the dynamics of
monolayers were carried out in the late 1970s [420,421]. Full structural and dynamic details on the basis of simple interactions are
produced from MD methods and are generally considered more
powerful than MC methods. However, these MD simulations were
primitive.
Toxvaerd’s study of the equation of state of dense monolayers used a pairwise potential to describe the interaction between
close-packed carbon chains [421]. These numerical dynamical calculations were carried out using models of rough monolayers
where individual molecules were treated as purely 2D objects (i.e.,
the molecules are only allowed to move in the plane of the monolayer). This treatment neglects the inﬂuence of steric interactions
of the chains and the large number of possible conformations. The
simulations yield a description of the crystalline state of the monolayer and the melting behavior of the molecules is not predicted.
A more sophisticated MD simulation of SAM formation was
reported by Weigel and coworkers in 1980 of a lipid monolayer that
displayed a ﬁrst order phase transition from an ordered ﬂuid state
to a disordered gas state [422]. Shortly after this report appeared
van der Ploeg and Berdensen presented a representation of a lipid
bilayer serving as a model for a biological membrane that includes
Lennard–Jones, dihedral, and bond angle interaction potentials
while constraining bond lengths [423].
In 1988 Harris and Rice carried out an MD study of the thermodynamics of a monomolecular ﬁlm of pentadecanoic acid on water
[424]. In this simulation, water is treated as a polarizable continuum and the pentadecanoic acid molecules are treated as chains
of 15 pseudoatoms with internal bond constraints, angle bending and torsional intramolecular interactions, and Lennard–Jones
atom–atom intermolecular interactions. The results from these

simulations exhibit low pressure phases in temperature range of
300–400 K, low density vapor phase and well-ordered condensed
phase in sharp contrast with experimental studies which show
existence of a stable liquid-expanded phase. At the time of this
study, an understanding of the relationships between molecular
conformation, intermolecular interaction, and the structures of the
monolayer or multilayer systems was incomplete.
8.2. Models of SAMs on surfaces
The ﬁrst attempt at a molecular description of the structure and
dynamics of a SAM formed from alkane thiols on a metal surface
was carried out by Hautman and Klien in 1989 [425]. Adsorption processes of long-chain alkyl thiol molecules on gold surfaces
were not well understood at the time. MD simulations were used
to investigate the structure and dynamics of monolayers of longchain molecules on a metallic substrate. Two models were explored
as alternative representations of the admolecule–surface interaction in layers formed by self-assembly of HS(CH2 )15 CH3 molecules
onto a gold substrate [425]. One model required that the S–C bond
lies nearly parallel to the substrate surface. After long MD simulation equilibration at room temperature both models yielded
monolayers with chains aligned with one another and tilted with
respect to the surface normal. The two models resulted in different tilt angles. Despite this difference in tilt angle, the thickness
of the two modeled monolayers is the same and the inﬂuence of
the modiﬁed head group on the detailed structure of the ﬁlm is
conﬁned to the region closest to the metal surface. Notably the
two models showed remarkable differences in the chain rotational
dynamics.
In 1993, new force ﬁeld parameters were derived to model the
binding of alkane thiolates on gold and silver surfaces from ab initio calculations [426]. The ﬁrst molecular mechanics (MM) energy
minimization using these new force ﬁeld parameters were presented. Ab initio geometry optimizations of HS and CH3 S on cluster
models of Au(1 1 1), Au(1 0 0), Ag(1 1 1), and Ag(1 0 0) surfaces were
performed at the RECP Hartree-Fock (HF) + electron correlation
(MBPT2) level. Using these calculations, MD force ﬁeld parameters were determined. The results of these calculations show that
there are two chemisorption modes that are very close in energy
for thiolates on Au(1 1 1) surfaces. In the ﬁrst chemisorption mode,
the surface–S–C angle is ∼180◦ due to sp hybridization. The second
mode shows a surface–S–C angle of ∼104◦ due to sp3 hybridization. These modes reveal a possible mechanism for the annealing
of alkane thiol monolayers.
8.3. Terminal group effects
In the late 1980s n-alkane thiol SAMs began to be more
widely examined experimentally as model systems to explore
relationships between molecular structures, surfaces and surface
properties [261–268,427–430]. Despite several studies of n-alkane
thiols on Au(1 1 1) using a variety of techniques such as atomic force
microscopy, scanning tunneling microscopy, FTIR, SERS, X-ray,
diffraction of electrons and helium atoms, the packing structures
and the chemisorption mode of alkane thiols remained ambiguous
[331,431–443].
To address questions regarding the experimentally observed
odd–even effect, computational studies including geometry optimizations and MD simulations were performed for self-assembled
monolayers of n-alkane thiols (RSH) and 4 -alkoxybiphenyl-4thiols (ROC12 H8 SH), where R = C16 H33 ,C17 H35 on a Au(1 1 1) surface
using a full atomic representation force ﬁeld by Li et al. in 1998
[444]. These MD simulations explain origins of different odd–even
effects observed by IR for long-chain n-alkane thiols and 4 alkoxybiphenyl-4-thiols and established a relationship between

A.L. Eckermann et al. / Coordination Chemistry Reviews 254 (2010) 1769–1802

chemical structures of the head groups and packing structures of
thiols on Au(1 1 1).
Modeling the properties of carboxylic acid-terminated SAMs
was performed in 2005 by Harding and coworkers [415]. The motivation for this study was to address experimental work that showed
that the length of a chain (odd or even number of carbon atoms)
of long-chain carboxylic acid monolayers determined whether oriented growth is observed [324,331,445,446]. MD simulations were
used to investigate the conﬁrmation of head groups of both odd and
even number of carbon atoms of the chains. From the simulations
it was determined that there were differences in the head group
packing structure for odd and even length chains at 300 K in the
presence of water.
In 2005 Goddard and coworkers performed a computational
study on charge transport characteristics of biphenyldithiol (BPDT)
SAMs in molecular electronic devices [447]. They identiﬁed an
energetically favorable herringbone-type SAM packing conﬁguration of the BPDT monolayer from force ﬁeld MD and annealing
simulations. Three molecular electronic device models differing in
packing orientation and tilt angle were developed for comparison.
The coherent charge transport properties were calculated using a
Green’s function approach. Current–voltage curves were generated
using a Landauer–Büttiker formula.
From these curves it was found that at low-bias voltages the
i–V characteristics of a herringbone SAM with a 30◦ tilt angle and
a parallel-oriented SAM with a 30◦ tilt are similar. The current for
the herringbone SAM model with a 15◦ tilt angle is smaller than for
either the herringbone model with a 30◦ tilt angle or the parallel
structure model with 30◦ tilt angle. For the high-bias region i–V
characteristics of all three models show noticeable differences due
to phenyl band structures. They conclude that i–V characteristics of
the BPDT SAM in the low-bias voltage region are mostly determined
by the molecular junction properties, or the Si–Au interaction with
the individual molecule–electrode contacts. At the high-bias region
both intermolecular conformation and interactions can affect the
BPDT SAM i–V characteristics.
Experimentally, it has been shown that OEG (oligo(ethylene
glycol))-terminated alkane thiol monolayers resist protein adsorption [448]. However, a detailed study of the OEG structure shows
that only the helical conformation resists protein adsorption,
whereas the more densely packed planar phases are less resistant
to protein adsorption [449].
To understand how structural modiﬁcations of the SAM effect
resistance to protein absorption, Grunze et al. performed ab initio HF calculations to explain the difference in protein absorption
properties between the OEG groups in a 7/2 helical conformation
(helical-SAM) and planar all-trans conformation on Ag (trans-SAM)
[450]. For this study, the water near the SAM surface was modeled
with small clusters comprising 20 water molecules and up to 12
rigid OEG strands packed hexagonally. The calculations showed
that a single helical OEG strand was capable of forming strong
hydrogen bonds with a water molecule bridging two successive
oxygen atoms of the OEG strand. The planar all-trans conformation
allowed only the formation of a single hydrogen bond involving one
OEG oxygen atom and one water hydrogen atom.
The trans-SAM model was unable to form hydrogen bonds with
water, except for weak C–H· · ·O bonds with terminal methyl hydrogens. The densely packed rigid trans-SAM structure did not allow
water molecules to penetrate into the SAM to reach the oxygen
atoms of the ethylene glycol unit second from the surface, thus
sacriﬁcing the ability to form bridging hydrogen bonds with water
as observed in the helical-SAM model. The authors speculate that
bridging hydrogen bonds may be formed in less dense regions of
the helical-SAM near defect sites.
In contrast to the ab initio HF calculations that used a rigid
model, a MC simulation of water near the surface of ﬂexible

1797

OEG-terminated SAMs was undertaken [418]. The simulation was
carried out using a TIP4P model of water near the surface of an
OEG-terminated alkane thiol SAM. The simulation of the behavior
of water near the helical- and trans-OEG-terminated alkane thiol
SAM has revealed a short-range effect of the SAM on the structure
of the adjacent water layers.
Water molecules were able to penetrate deeper into the helicalSAM than the trans-SAM and formed more hydrogen bonds.
Further, in agreement with experimental results, the presence of
water has a disordering affect on the OEG groups. The adsorption
of a protein molecule onto an OEG-SAM surface is presumed to
involve displacement of water molecules from the surface, therefore, the SAM with a higher surface density of water molecules and
hydrogen bonds should be more resistant to protein adsorption.
MD and electrochemical investigations of a pH responsive peptide monolayer have been reported [360]. The secondary structure
of the peptide sequence HELELELELELC was studied using MD at 2
different pH values, 2 and 7. The results of the MD show that at pH
2 the alpha helix conformation is stable for over 200 ns. At pH 7, a
random coil is irreversibly obtained after 70 ns due to electrostatic
repulsions between negatively charged carboxylate groups of the
glutamic acid residues. The authors used this information to guide
experiments in which the effect of pH on the ET properties of the
peptide monolayers was examined (Section 6.4).
8.4. Ferrocene
Molecular dynamics simulations of mixed monolayers consisting of Fc(CH2 )12 S–/C10 S–Au SAMs have been carried out [451].
Simulations were performed to calculate both structural and energetic properties in order to explore the possible inhomogeneity of
the neutral ferrocene moieties within the monolayer. Structural
inhomogeneity has been implicated as the cause of non-ideal electrochemical responses [288].
Five systems were studied using different grafting densities
for the ferrocenyl alkane thiols. The angular distributions were
described in terms of the relative contributions from isolated and
clustered ferrocene moieties in the binary SAMs. The ferrocene
groups prefer hydrophobic interactions with the alkane chains
rather than hydrophilic interactions in the interfacial region. It
was shown that the energetic contributions from each interaction (Fc–Fc, Fc–alkane, Fc–H2 O) strongly depend on whether the
ferrocene is in an isolated or clustered state.
8.5. Silicon surfaces
SAMs on silicon have recently attracted interest for application
of these layers in semiconductor technology. A molecular modeling
study of covalently attached monolayers on a hydrogen terminated
Si(1 1 1) surface was performed by Sudhoelter and coworkers in
2001 [419]. Octadecyl monolayers on the H-terminated Si(1 1 1)
surface were investigated using MD simulations with substitution
percentages of the Si–H moieties by Si-alkyl groups ranging from
33% to 100%. The potential application of employing covalently
bound organic monolayers on silicon surfaces in semiconductor
technology was the motivation for this research.
In modeling monolayer-modiﬁed surfaces, periodic boundary
conditions may or may not be included. The latter approach that
does not include periodic boundary conditions and edge effects may
be signiﬁcant when using small surfaces. However, these effects
may disappear upon an increase in surface size. Calculations on
ﬁnite surfaces without periodic boundary conditions showed that
all surfaces display edge effects where molecules on one edge of the
surface are slightly tilted, whereas the other edge has molecules
with a tilt angle that is much larger (both edges are in reference to
molecules in the middle of the structure). The edge effects decrease

1798

A.L. Eckermann et al. / Coordination Chemistry Reviews 254 (2010) 1769–1802

with an increase in surface size. The average energy per alkyl chain
in these structures has a dependence on the ﬁnite surface size and
the energy values are considerably higher than that of analogous
periodic box simulations.
The difference is attributed to a much smaller contribution
from mutual van der Waal forces that are not properly accounted
for on ﬁnite surfaces. Similar simulations with periodic boundary
conditions did not show these edge effect complications and the
optimal number of alkyl chains per simulation box is ∼30. Simulations with fewer alkyl chains per simulation box showed that the
results depend strongly on the size of the box. Calculations exploring substitution percentages of the Si–H for Si-alkyl groups on the
monolayer structure show that only a substitution percentage of
50% gives satisfactory agreement with available experimental data.
9. Conclusions
Current work in long-range biological electron transfer, artiﬁcial photosynthesis, and molecular electronics continues to draw
on electrochemical studies of redox-modiﬁed SAMs. Molecular components such as switches, rectiﬁers, and transistors for
nanomanufacturing of electronic devices incorporating SAMs are
characterized by their ET properties.
The nature of the bridge between donor and acceptor is an active
area of study. Electrochemical SAM studies continue to provide
information regarding the effects of the bridge and the molecular
environment on electron transfer [73,86]. A signiﬁcant amount of
work is directed towards developing new molecular junctions such
as peptides [452–454]. Electrochemical SAM studies have allowed
the direct comparison of photoinduced electron transfer (transient
emission spectroscopy) to ground state electron transfer [155,455].
The electrochemical methods and surface chemistry described
in this review allow researchers to determine speciﬁc electron
transfer parameters. However, the myriad of electrochemical
variables and sensitivity of the techniques, along with the mathematical analysis can be overwhelming. We have attempted to
assemble descriptions of each of the electrochemical methods and
the corresponding data analysis in order to make these methods
more accessible to the general readership. The literature illustrates
that the nature of the redox-active species and the SAM structure are critical to the accurate determination of kET . We have
described how electrochemical methods can be used to evaluate these aspects. The history of computational modeling of SAMs
closely parallels experimental work. It is our hope that this review
will assist researchers in deciding which electrochemical technique
best suits their purposes. Future work will undoubtedly explore
the correlation of structural features of redox-active SAMs, both
covalent and noncovalent, to electron transfer parameters.
