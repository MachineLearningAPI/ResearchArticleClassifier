Reducing anthropogenic CO2 emission and lowering the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere has quickly become one of the most urgent environmental issues of our age. Carbon capture and
storage (CCS) is one option for reducing these harmful CO2 emissions. While a variety of technologies and
methods have been developed, the separation of CO2 from gas streams is still a critical issue. Apart from
establishing new techniques, the exploration of capture materials with high separation performance
and low capital cost are of paramount importance. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), a new class of
crystalline porous materials constructed by metal-containing nodes bonded to organic bridging ligands
hold great potential as adsorbents or membrane materials in gas separation. In this paper, we review the
research progress (from experimental results to molecular simulations) in MOFs for CO2 adsorption, storage, and separations (adsorptive separation and membrane-based separation) that are directly related
to CO2 capture.

1. Introduction
With the rapid increase of the global population and the industrialization of more and more countries, the consumption of energy
is explosively growing. Currently over 85% of the global energy
demand is being supported by the burning of fossil fuels [1]. The
reasons for this skewed reliance on fossil fuels as our primary
energy source is due to the inherent energy density, abundance,
and the economic dependence of modern society on the acquisition and trade of these resources. Fossil fuels will continue to play
an important role in the foreseeable future, mainly in power generation and industrial manufacturing. The burning of these fossil
fuels releases large amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere; this disturbs the carbon balance of our planet which has been steady over
hundreds of millions of years. Although anthropogenic CO2 emissions are relatively small compared to the natural carbon ﬂuxes,
such as photosynthetic ﬂuxes, the increased release has had obvious inﬂuences on the global climate in a very short period of time
[1,2]. Since the beginning of the industrial age in ca. 1750, the CO2
concentration in atmosphere has increased from 280 to 390 ppm
in 2010 (Fig. 1) [1]. The increase of the CO2 concentration in atmosphere inﬂuences the balance of incoming and outgoing energy
in the atmosphere system, leading to the raise of average surface
temperature of earth. Thus, CO2 has often been cited as the primary anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) as well as the leading
culprit in climate change. Although there are many uncertainties,
it is beyond all doubt that strategies to reduce CO2 emissions are
urgently required to minimize climate change.
The ultimate goal of a green society will only be achieved when
we relinquish our dependence on fossil fuels in favor of clean
energy sources such as hydrogen fuel or solar energy. In the interim

period to a low-carbon society, however, it is imperative to reduce
anthropogenic CO2 emission [3]. The estimation from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has shown that CO2
emissions could be reduced by 80–90% for a modern power plant
that is equipped with suitable carbon dioxide capture and storage
(CCS) technologies [4]. The use of CCS will also complement other
crucial strategies, such as switching to less carbon fuels, improving energy efﬁciency, and phasing in the use of renewable energy
resources.

CCS is a three-step process including CO2 capture, a process consisting of separating CO2 from other emissions before it enters the
atmosphere; CO2 transportation to a storage site; and its permanent storage. The transportation and storage of CO2 are relatively
mature technologies and a growing number of fully integrated CCS
projects have reached the pilot-stage prior to commercialization
[5]. However, the considerable cost of capture, approximately two
thirds of the total cost for CCS (primarily separating CO2 from
other gases), is slowing down the deployment of commercial CCS
projects. In the majority of the proposed technologies, one signiﬁcant contributor to lower cost is the maximum separation efﬁciency
that can be achieved by a given capture material. Thus, the discovery of new materials with high separation ability becomes one of
the biggest challenges. Several monographs have been published
on this topic, where basic knowledge, progress, and perspective for
CCS were presented by experts in this ﬁeld [1–3,5].
1.1. Technologies/methods and materials in CO2 capture
Exploring cost-effective and scalable technologies and methods
for CO2 capture from power generation and industrial operation
where CO2 is produced on the combustion of fossil fuels is regarded
as the most effective strategy in controlling anthropogenic CO2
emission. Depending on the generation of CO2 , several capture
options and tendentious technologies have been suggested and
implemented. Generally, based on the fundamental chemical process involved in the combustion of fossil fuels, three basic CO2
separation and capture options were adopted: (1) pre-combustion
capture; (2) oxy-fuel combustion; and (3) post-combustion capture
[1]. As an example, the three options for CO2 capture from power
generation plants are illustrated schematically in Fig. 2.
Pre-combustion capture involves the reaction of a primary fuel
with oxygen or air to produce H2 . In some cases the produced gas
mixture is mainly composed of CO and H2 , which is known as synthesis gas (syngas). The CO formed is further reacted with steam in
a catalytic reactor, called a shift converter, to give CO2 and more H2 .
The separation of CO2 and H2 then can be achieved by a number of
technologies. Pre-combustion has the advantage of lower energy
requirements, but the temperature and efﬁciency associated with
H2 -rich gas turbine fuel is a big problem. More challenging issues
are the enormous capital cost and the public resistance for new
construction. Chemical looping cycles are being investigated as an
alternative method to generate syngas [7].

Oxy-fuel combustion has the stringent requirement of nearly
pure oxygen, rather than air, for the combustion of fuels; the
advantage here being that the gaseous product is nearly pure CO2 ,
which can be directly stored. The drawback of this option is the
requirement of pure oxygen, which can usually be obtained by the
separation of air or by other novel techniques that are available.
However, the conventional cryogenic air separation to produce O2
contributes to the high capital cost for this option.
Post-combustion capture requires removing CO2 from ﬂue gas,
comprised mainly of N2 and CO2 , before emission into the atmosphere. Post-combustion capture is the most feasible on a short
time scale because many of the proposed technologies can be
retroﬁtted to existing fossil fuel consuming power plants. One such
new approach involves also using cooled and CO2 -rich ﬂue gases
to feed bioreactors to produce microalgal biomass that would be
used as a biofuel. An additional advantage of post-combustion
capture is that even if when the CO2 capture unit is shut down
for an emergency, one can still generate electricity, which is not
possible with the other more integrated capture methods. Postcombustion methods have been deployed commercially, primarily
for the removal of minor contaminants such as Hg and SOx /NOx
gas, but the materials for the CO2 separation require modiﬁcation,
especially those with high preparation and regeneration costs.
A further advantage of developing CO2 separation techniques
is their application in the puriﬁcation of natural gas (mainly CH4 ),
which is typically soured with over 40% CO2 and N2 and is only
useable at low concentrations of CO2 . One of the challenges in
this separation is the special technologies and materials that are
required to withstand the high pressures that are present during
the mining of natural gas [8,9].
Fig. 3 schematically illustrates the technologies and method
usually used in CO2 separation; in each case, except for cryogenic
separation, different materials are required as the carriers.
Absorption (i.e. solvent scrubbing) is a well-established CO2 separation approach used in the chemical and petroleum industries
today. Absorption falls into two categories: (1) physical, which is
temperature and pressure dependent (absorption occurs at high
pressures and low temperatures) and (2) chemical where absorption of CO2 depends on the acid–base neutralization reaction
(in this case caustic solvents are required). Some of the preferred solvents are amines (such as monoethanolamine), ammonia
solutions, Selexol, Rectisol, and ﬂuorinated solvents. The most
recent addition is ionic liquids, which have exhibited great poten-

tial in absorption of CO2 and are also environmentally benign
[11,12].
Cryogenic distillation uses a principle of separation based on
cooling and condensation, and has been used in liquid separations for a long time. This technique is theoretically sound for CO2
separation, however, the considerable energy demand deems it
unreasonable for practical application. This method is more effective when the gas stream contains high CO2 concentration and it
can be adopted in oxygen production for oxyfuel combustion. It is
presently the most widely used system for the large-scale production of O2 from the separation of air.
Membrane-based separation is based on the differences in
physical and/or chemical interactions between gases and the
membrane material, which can be modiﬁed to allow some components to pass preferentially through the membrane based on
size (kinetic) and/or afﬁnity (thermodynamics). Membranes have
great potential in CO2 /H2 separation in pre-combustion capture
and post-combustion CO2 /N2 separation. A wide variety of different membrane materials and processes are available, some of
which already on an industrial scale, and potentially applicable
in CO2 separation. The performance and associated cost of these
membrane-based technologies in large scale CO2 capture mainly
relies on the membrane materials themselves. Inorganic ceramic
membranes and organic polymeric membranes have been used in
CO2 separation from ﬂue gas in post-combustion. However, reaching a high degree of CO2 separation by using single-stage ceramic
or polymeric membrane is difﬁcult as of yet (although it is feasible
in terms of cost). New materials are still required to achieve the
desired effectiveness in CO2 separation by membranes.
Gas separation based on adsorption has been well developed,
in which the selection of a sound adsorbent is the key for speciﬁc
separation. Although materials for gas adsorptive separation have
been established and a diverse range of useful sorbents are available for CO2 separation, there is still plenty of room to optimize
the performance of these materials and investigate a wider range
of new sorbents. These adsorbents can then be combined with a
broad range of process options yielding a fertile ﬁeld for the optimization of separation performance. Conventional solid adsorbents
include activated carbons, silica gel, ion-exchange resins, zeolites,
and meso-porous silicates, activated alumina, metal oxides, and
other surface-modiﬁed porous media. In recent years, a few of new
adsorbents such as carbon ﬁbres and their composites as well as
metal-organic frameworks have been developed for gas separation. A recent review has comprehensively described the adsorbent

materials for CO2 capture from large anthropogenic point sources
[13]. Depending on the regeneration methods, several adsorption
processes can been adopted to achieve CO2 separation, including (1)
vacuum and pressure swing adsorption (VSA and PSA), (2) temperature swing adsorption (TSA), (3) electric swing adsorption (ESA),
(4) simulated moving bed (SMB), and (5) purge displacement.
Apart from physical and chemical methods mentioned above,
biological methods have also been proposed for CO2 separation
[14,15]. Algal bio-ﬁxation of CO2 in photo-bioreactors has, for
example, recently gained great interest in CO2 capture. In addition, attempts using chemoautotrophic microorganisms which use
inorganic chemicals instead of light energy for CO2 removal have
also been investigated [16].
It is evident that the progress and achievement of almost all of
these technologies relies heavily on the development of materials.
The challenges that arise in the development of these materials
and techniques lies in being able to transfer the technology from
the lab to the harsh conditions that it will be subjected to while
maximizing efﬁciency and minimizing costs.
1.2. Advances and challenges in CO2 capture
CCS is a fast growing ﬁeld of research and a broad range of
technologies are being explored and developed on a daily basis.
A few technologies have already reached the deployment stage,
but most require further improvements to the technical capabilities
and reduction in the associated costs. The most mature technology,
post-combustion amine absorption, has been employed in industry for a long time [17]. Simultaneously, a number of materials
are available for different technologies and some new materials
are emerging. However, the commercialization of any one these
technologies still faces substantial challenges not only in the ﬁnal
technological and processes aspects but also in the capabilities of
the capture materials themselves.
Up to date, three options have developed to a stage commercially viable, namely post-combustion CO2 capture using
amine solvents based on chemical absorption, oxyfuel combustion, and calcium looping [18]. The membrane-based separation
and adsorption of CO2 into advanced sorbents, such as zeolites and
metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), have become intense research
subjects in the last ten years. Tuning the properties of traditional
adsorbents can be quite challenging which is why these new,
advanced sorbents have become such a hot topic. Since separation
is a combination of a kinetic (diffusion selectivity) and a thermo-

gas molecules. The relatively small difference in kinetic diameters

sion based purely on size very challenging, but the differences in
electronic properties such as quadrupolar moment and polarization
can be used to accomplish the tasks at hand [19].
Challenges and shortcomings in terms of the three basic capture
options for CO2 are outlined brieﬂy below. For pre-combustion capture: (1) poor availability and operability is the primary deﬁciency;
(2) no single process is responsible for the overall operational performance; (3) high cost remains; and (4) systems are not mature for
large-scale application. For oxy-fuel combustion capture: (1) the
technology is only at a developmental stage without commercial
experience; and (2) the air-separation that supplies pure oxygen
consumes a lot of energy. For post-combustion capture: (1) low
pressure and dilute CO2 concentration of the ﬂue gas requires a
high volume of gas to be treated; (2) compression of the captured
CO2 requires additional energy; and (3) the regeneration of the sorbent (the amine solution) requires a high energy input. Most of
these problems can be solved with the implementation of advanced
materials.
The three basic technologies for CO2 separation: absorption,
adsorption, and membrane processes, have been extensively studied, using the amine-based absorption process as the current
bench mark. Despite the intensive investigation, however, no single technology has been demonstrated to be capable of meeting the
requirements set by the DOE/NETL: 90% CO2 capture at less than
a 35% increase in the cost of electricity (COE) [20,21]. In almost
all absorption and chemical adsorption processes, the capture and
separation steps consist of the formation of CO2 -based molecular
complexes via chemical interactions and subsequent regeneration
of CO2 through signiﬁcant increases in temperature. This regeneration accounts for the majority of the parasitic power requirement
[22]. There is therefore a critical need to develop transformative
CO2 capture materials and processes that can drastically lower the
operation cost by addressing the regeneration cost. In this regard,
CO2 capture by physical sorbents and membranes can provide
promising energy-efﬁcient alternatives to the current amine-based
absorption systems if the following challenges can be addressed.
CO2 capture by physical sorbents such as carbonaceous materials and inorganic porous materials such as zeolites is much more
energy-efﬁcient as compared to that by chemical sorbents. This
is due to the absence of the formation of new chemical bonds
between the sorbate and sorbent, thereby requiring signiﬁcantly
less energy for regeneration [13]. However, the traditional carbonaceous materials, such as activated carbon, are limited by low CO2 /N2
selectivities (ca. 10), and while zeolites show signiﬁcantly higher
selectivities, they suffer from lower CO2 loading and their perfor-

mance is impaired in the presence of water [13,22]. Therefore, there
is an urgent need to develop advanced physical sorbents with a high
CO2 capacity and high CO2 /N2 selectivity.
Membrane-based CO2 separation is one of the most energyefﬁcient ways to capture CO2 [22]. However, the traditional polymer membranes suffer from low CO2 /N2 selectivity (less than 100).
For the membrane-based separation to be commercially viable, the
CO2 /N2 selectivity must be in the range of 200 [23]. Despite the
potential of molecular sieve membranes, conventional molecular
sieves (i.e. zeolites) are limited for their use for CO2 /N2 separation
˚ and

molecular sieve membranes with high CO2 /N2 selectivity.
In summary, the stability, scalability, CO2 afﬁnity, and involved
energy in application will be the dominant considerations in the
search for capture materials that will compete with the technologies mentioned above. Engineering of gas-sorbent interactions at
molecular level, such as the design of a molecular basket for CO2
may be one of key notions to future success.
1.3. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), a new class of materials
available for CO2 capture
In the past two decades, a new class of crystalline porous
materials, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) has emerged and
the associated research has been developed into one of the most
proliﬁc areas in chemistry and materials science [24–28]. MOFs
are comprised of metal-containing nodes linked by organic ligand bridges and assembled principally through strong coordination
bonds. MOFs have geometrically and crystallographically welldeﬁned framework structures and in most cases, these structures
are robust enough to allow the removal of the included guest
species resulting in permanent porosity. The crystallinity of MOFs
also allows precise structural characterization by diffraction methods, thus facilitating their rational design and the formulation of
structure–function relationships.
MOFs can be conceptually designed and synthesized based on
how building blocks come together to form a net (an example is
shown in Fig. 4 [29,30]). As a result, the structures and properties
of MOFs can be designed and systematically tuned by the judicious
choice of building blocks. Besides the pre-design in synthesis, postsynthetic modiﬁcations have also been successfully used in tuning
the pore properties of MOFs [31]. This remarkable and easy tunability is quite different from that of traditional porous materials, such
as zeolites and activated carbon. It allows facile optimization of the
pore structure, surface functions, and other properties for speciﬁc
applications as porous material.
MOFs can be categorized into rigid and ﬂexible/dynamic classes.
Rigid MOFs usually have comparatively stable and robust porous

1796

with initial attention being paid to both adsorption equilibrium
and kinetics (diffusion selectivity) for adsorptive separation. These
investigations can provide not only an effective way to screen
suitable adsorbents for their separation capabilities but can also
contribute to a better understanding of related adsorption processes. A lot of MOFs have been experimentally examined for
CO2 adsorption and related gas separation. While initial works in
this area only tested general equilibrium adsorption isotherms,
the more recent work has shifted its focus closer to practical
application, including ultimate storage capacities and selective
adsorption and separation of gases, particularly those linked to
CCS. The total body of work has mimicked the traditional experimental methods for gas adsorption and separation in solid-state
porous materials, including single-component equilibrium adsorption, diffusion, co-adsorption, mixed gas breakthrough experiment
(ﬁxed-bed adsorption), column chromatography separation, along
with stability and porosity tests (such as surface area).

frameworks with permanent porosity, similar to zeolites, whereas
ﬂexible MOFs possess dynamic, “soft” frameworks that respond
to external stimuli, such as pressure, temperature, and guest
molecules. This extraordinary sensitivity to external stimuli affords
MOFs special properties such as pressure/temperature dependent
molecular sieving, which is beyond the reach of traditional adsorbents, such as zeolites and activated carbons.
MOFs can be made with exceptionally high porosity and are
typically synthesized by a self-assembly reaction between various
metal ions and organic linkers under mild conditions. Different synthetic approaches have been developed including solution reaction
under ambient (r.t.) conditions, solvothermal synthesis (including
hydrothermal synthesis), solid state synthesis (so-called green synthesis), and microwave synthesis [32].
MOFs hold several records in porous materials including highest
surface areas [33], hydrogen uptake based on physical adsorption [34], methane [35] and CO2 storage [33]. Recently, several
thematic reviews have highlighted the rapid developments in
the design, synthesis, and potential applications of these materials [19,31,36–65]. As porous material, MOFs are therefore ideal
adsorbents or membrane materials for gas storage and separation,
including CO2 capture due to their large surface areas, adjustable
pore sizes, and controllable pore surface properties.
A number of recent qualiﬁed and comprehensive reviews were
published with emphasis on different topics of the CCS ﬁeld
[10,13,18,66–90]; readers are directed to these papers for a more
detailed understanding for CO2 capture. Following the above general introduction of CO2 capture, the progress in CO2 adsorption,
storage, and related gas separation research, which is directly
related to CO2 capture in MOFs is reviewed in this paper. The rapidly
growing number of related primary research articles (Fig. 5) is an
indication that a comprehensive review in this ﬁeld is necessary in
order to draw general conclusions and provide some guided perspectives for future research; despite the fact that a few reviews
involving related topics of CO2 capture with MOFs have appeared
very recently [13,18,90–93].
2. Experimental exploration of CO2 adsorption and
adsorptive separation in MOFs
Experimental exploration is the most direct approach in the
evaluation of any adsorbent material for separation application,

Over 100 individual MOFs with single-component adsorption
of CO2 have thus far been reported; the results of these experiments have been summarized in Table S1 (see supplementary data).
These adsorption data were obtained from the single-component
isotherm measurements at a given temperature, with pressures
ranging from very low to atmospheric pressure in most cases, to
high pressures in a few cases. Measurements at room (or slightly
elevated) temperature and low pressure most resemble practical
CO2 capture, because of the low CO2 component in the gas streams
that need to be separated. Adsorption isotherms at low temperature
and normal pressure are, however, useful in evaluating the adsorption properties, testing the CO2 selective adsorption capacities, and
optimizing the design of MOFs. Furthermore, the adsorption under
room temperature and high pressure is directed to the evaluation
of the total CO2 storage ability of a MOF; all of these fall under the
CCS umbrella.
2.1.1. CO2 adsorption in MOFs
Like most porous materials, CO2 adsorption and uptake in MOFs
are pore size/volume and surface dependent. Compared to other
porous materials, such as zeolites and activated carbon, most MOFs
have a higher pore volume and surface area, leading to record CO2
uptakes as shown in Table S1. The majority of these results, are not
discussed in detail, instead some unique adsorption phenomena
and experimental explorations, along with typical examples, are
touched upon herein.
Usually, the CO2 adsorption isotherm in rigid porous materials,
such as traditional zeolites and the majority of rigid MOFs, presents
a normal type-I shape, but in a few rigid MOFs, stepwise isotherms
have been observed. This can be related to the structural features of
these MOFs, as per example, Zhang et al. [94] reported the two-step
CO2 adsorption at low temperature in a highly connected MOF,
NiII 2 NiIII ( 3 -OH)(pba)3 (2,6-ndc)1.5 (MCF-19; pba = 4-(pyridin4-yl)benzoate, 2,6-ndc = 2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylate), which
has a biporous structure with cages and channels that co-exist.
On the other hand, several similar stepwise CO2 adsorption
behaviors, giving sigmoidal isotherms, have been observed
in some ultrahigh pore MOFs, such as Zn4 O(bdc)3 (MOF-5 or
IRMOF-1, bdc = 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate), Zn4 O(btb)2 (MOF-177,
btb = benzene-1,3,5-tribenzoate),
and
Zn4 O(bte)14/9 (bpdc)6/9
(MOF-210,
bte = 4,4 ,4 -(benzene-1,3,5-triyltris(ethyne-2,1diyl))tribenzoate, bpdc = biphenyl-4,4 -dicarboxylate) at near
room temperature and high pressures [33,95] (Fig. 6a). In these
cases, this phenomenon was attributed to the attractive electrostatic interactions between CO2 molecules that lead to their
bulk condensation, which has been explained by Snurr and

Fig. 6. Structures and unique CO2 adsorption–desorption isotherms in (a) rigid MOF5, -177, -200, 205, and 210 (only the crystal structure of MOF-210 is shown here)

coworkers in terms of molecular simulation [96]. As a last
example, hysteretic CO2 adsorption in rigid MOF, Zn(2,7-ndc) (2,7ndc = 2,7-naphthalenedicarboxylate) was attributed to the unique
arrangement of the pore channels and their narrow passages
compared to the critical dimensions of a CO2 molecule [97].
In contrast, ﬂexible MOFs usually result in stepwise adsorption and/or show hysteretic desorption isotherms for CO2 and
other gases. This ﬂexibility is a unique property of some MOFs,
which shows great potential in selective adsorption and separation of gases and other small molecules. The M(OH)(bdc) (MIL-53)
series provides typical examples of MOFs that “breathe” during
the adsorption and desorption of CO2 , which has been associated with a phase transition of these MOF structures [98–105].
For MIL-53(Cr), these phase transformations were tracked by
gas-sorption-coupled X-ray diffraction. The geometric parame˚ so-called large
ters switch from the almost square (8.5 A˚ × 8.5 A),
pore (LP), to the narrow-pore (NP) form, with trapezoidal pores
˚ upon CO2 adsorption; simultaneously, the unit cell
(2.6 A˚ × 13.6 A)
volume decreases by 40%. More interesting is that as the CO2
loading increases, the structure converts back from the NP to
the LP form. Similarly, CO2 adsorption in Sc2 (bdc)3 at 235 K and
1 bar resulted in a symmetry change of crystal structure from
orthorhombic Fddd to monoclinic C2/c through the tilting of bdc
linkers. CO2 molecules take up different adsorption sites in two
symmetrically different channels of framework that result from this
symmetry change [106]. A post-synthetic modiﬁcation strategy has
also been used to modulate the breathing behavior of MOFs. Cohen
and coworkers [107] reported the modiﬁcation of DMOF-1-NH2 ,
Zn2 (NH2 -bdc)2 (dabco) (dabco = 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane), to
DMOF-1-AM(n − 1) where ‘n’ denotes the chain length of the
newly formed linear alkyl amide. Systematic CO2 adsorption
measurements on DMOF-1-AM(n − 1) showed that the breathing is related to the alkyl chain length of the post-added
groups. The step adsorption and hysteresis of desorption at
196 K for DMOF-1-AM3 is very similar to that observed in
MIL-53. Another example, Ni(bpee)Ni(CN)4 (bpee = trans-1,2bis(4-pyridyl)ethylene), reported by Culp and coworkers, is a
three-dimensional (3D) framework constructed by a ﬂexible
organic bridging ligand, bpee, pillaring two-dimensional (2D) rigid

1797

Ni(CN)4 inorganic layers. The hysteretic CO2 adsorption/desorption
isotherm observed in this MOF, was attributed to a structural phase
transition resulting from a variation in the tilt angle of the bpee
pillars. A structurally similar MOF, but with a rigid organic linker,
4,4 -bipyridine gave rise to a normal type-I isotherm for CO2 , clarifying the provenance of the hysteresis [108].
Interpenetrated MOFs sometimes show ﬂexible character due
to the moving between the single frameworks with respect
to each other. Dramatic steps in the adsorption and hysteresis in the desorption of CO2 have been observed in a
twofold interpenetrated MOF, Zn2 (bttb)(dpni) (bttb = 4,4 ,4 ,4 benzene-1,2,4,5-tetrayltetrabenzolate, dpni = N,N -di-(4-pyridyl)1,4,5,8-naphthalenetetracarboxydiimide) reported by Hupp and
coworkers [109]. Characterization of the structure by PXRD and
pair distribution function (PDF) analysis indicated that structural
changes upon CO2 sorption most likely involve the moving of the
interpenetrated frameworks.
A “gate” phenomenon has been observed in several ﬂexible MOFs [110–117]. An early example that clearly illustrates this “gate” effect is Cu(pyrdc)(bpp) (pyrdc = pyridine2,3-dicarboxylate, bpp = 1,3-bis(4-pyridyl)propane), reported by
Kitagawa and coworkers [117]. The CO2 adsorption isotherm of
this MOF shows a sudden increase at a relatively low pressure, referred to as the gate-opening pressure, and saturation at
another pressure. The desorption isotherm, on the other hand,
does not retrace the adsorption isotherm and shows an abrupt
drop at a third pressure. To elucidate the involved mechanism, the
authors have determined the crystal structure of the MOF after
CO2 inclusion. Perfectly correlating with the adsorption experiment, two CO2 molecules in two different channels are found
˚
for each Cu(II) atom. CO2 molecules form C–H· · ·O (2.46–2.59 A)
H-bonding interactions with the channel walls, providing the
driving force for the sorption with strong conﬁnement in the
framework. A similar “gate” phenomenon for CO2 adsorption
has also observed in [Cu(4,4 -bipy)(H2 O)2 (BF4 )2 ](4,4 -bipy) (4,4 bipy = 4,4 -bipyridine), after exposure to water [118]. Another very
interesting example is an adaptable peptide-based MOF, Zn(GlyAla)2 , reported recently by Rosseinsky and coworkers [119]. As
shown in Fig. 6b, CO2 adsorption exhibited gating opening above a
pressure of 2 bar, and further step adsorption at high pressure and
desorption hysteresis. Extensive experiments and molecular simulations indicated that the torsion and displacement of the peptide
linkers, combined with the changing of the pore conﬁrmation is
responsible for these unusual phenomena. This ﬂexibility enabled
pore volume to increase smoothly with an increase of CO2 loading.
2.1.2. Tuned adsorption and the heat of adsorption of CO2 in
MOFs
The impact on CO2 adsorption in MOFs by various other factors has also been explored. Kajiro and coworkers [120] examined
the effect of metal ions on the CO2 adsorption in two isostructural
MOFs, M(4,4 -bipy)2 (OTf)2 (M = Cu and Co). Although the difference in metal ions in these MOFs results in only slightly different
structures, the gas adsorption properties, based on the expansion/shrinkage of these MOF structures, are largely dependent on
the metal ions. As an alternative strategy, partial doping of MOF-5
with Co(II) by isomorphic substitution during synthesis has been
investigated to explore the effect on CO2 adsorption [121]. The
adsorption result showed that the CO2 uptake of these MOF-5based materials systematically increases with the increase of Co(II)
content at high pressure. Rosi and coworkers [122] demonstrated
recently that post-synthetic exchange of extra-framework cations
within an anionic MOF, [Zn8 (ad)4 (bpdc)6 O](cation) (bio-MOF-1,
ad = adeninate, bpdc = 4,4 -biphenyldicarboxylate), can be used as a
means to systematically modify its pore dimensions, thereby, tuning the CO2 adsorption capacity. From this work, they concluded

that smaller pores in MOFs (with large cations in this case) may
be ideal for condensing CO2 at temperatures relevant to practical
application. Similarly, using cation exchange to tune CO2 adsorption has also been reported by Kitagawa and coworkers in a ﬂexible
MOF, [Ni(bpe)2 (N(CN)2 )](cations) (bpe = 1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethane)
[123]. Furthermore, Snurr and coworkers [124] have demonstrated
that CO2 uptake in Cu3 (btc)2 (HKUST-1 or Cu-BTC, btc = 1,3,5benzenetricarboxylate) was signiﬁcantly enhanced by the presence
of water molecules coordinated to metal sites in the framework.
A detailed analysis of simulation data revealed that the interaction between the quadrupole moment of CO2 and the electric ﬁeld
created by water molecules is responsible for the increased CO2
uptake. Hydration of ﬂexible MIL-53(Cr) has also been demonstrated to enhance the CO2 adsorption relative to CH4 [103]. In addition, Cao and coworkers [125] recently showed that the incorporation of CNTs into MOFs can enhance the uptake of CO2 , which can be
further improved by doping the CNT-modiﬁed MOFs with lithium.
For gas adsorption, the isosteric heat of adsorption, calculated
usually from the adsorption isotherms at different temperatures,
is another deﬁnitive property that is directly related to the separation and storage ability. A detailed analysis of the CO2 adsorption
heat in the examined MOFs has been done by Sholl and coworkers in their recent review [91]. The heats of adsorption for CO2
(ref. Table S1) stretch across a large range, between 20 and
50 kJ/mol, for most MOFs, with the record of 90 kJ/mol being held
by an ethylenediamine-functionalized MOF reported by Long and
coworkers (vide infra) [126]. In most cases, the heat of adsorption
decreases with increased loading, and that a high heat of adsorption
is not necessarily good in terms of the CO2 separation application,
because of the large energy requirement associated with the regeneration (i.e. desorption) of the materials. Complementary to typical
method mentioned above, measurements of the heats of adsorption
by pulse-response experiments in an ultrahigh-vacuum reactor,
referred to as a TAP reactor (temporal analysis of products), have
been reported for the adsorption of CO2 in three MOFs: IRMOF-1,
Zn4 O(NH2 -bdc)3 (IRMOF-3), and HKUST-1 [127].
2.1.3. Probing CO2 adsorption sites and adsorption modes in
MOFs
Probing into adsorption sites and adsorption/binding modes is
critical for the design of new sorbent. Several examples on the

exploration of CO2 adsorption sites in MOFs have been mentioned
above. Very recently, Shimizu and coworkers [128,129] directly
observed the CO2 bonding within an amine-functionalized MOF,
Zn2 (Atz)(ox) (Atz = aminotriazolato, ox = oxalate) at low pressure
from the X-ray crystallographic resolution of the adsorbed CO2
molecules (Fig. 7). From the structural reﬁnement, two independent CO2 binding sites were located in the pores of this MOF: one is
near the free amine group and another is close to the oxalates. The
O(CO2 )· · ·H–N(NH2 ) hydrogen bond and interactions between the
N lone pair of the amine group and C atom of CO2 and between the O
atom of oxalate group and O atom of CO2 have been conﬁrmed. Furthermore, the CO2 · · ·CO2 cooperative interaction (between C and O
atoms) was also observed. Accompanied with molecular simulation
studies, they concluded that the combination of appropriate pore
size, strong interaction between CO2 and functional groups on the
pore surface, and cooperative binding of CO2 molecules is responsible for the low-pressure binding of CO2 in this MOF. Besides X-ray
diffraction related investigations of adsorbed CO2 in MOFs, IR spectroscopy coupled adsorption has proven to be a useful technique
in probing CO2 adsorption sites in MOFs. Bordiga et al. [130] investigated the CO2 adsorption in HKUST-1 by IR spectroscopy. Their
results showed that the coordinatively unsaturated Cu(II) centers
in this MOF act as speciﬁc interaction sites and play an important
role in the adsorption. Similarly, Blom and coworkers [131] have
shown that CO2 adopts the end-on coordination mode when interacting with the coordinatively unsaturated nickel sites of Ni2 (dhtp)
(H4 dhtp = 2,5-dihydroxyterephthalic acid), which gives rise to high
CO2 adsorption capacity at low pressures and ambient temperatures. Vimont et al. [102] studied the CO2 adsorption mode at low
coverage in MIL-53(Cr). The red shift of the 3 band and splitting
of the 2 mode of CO2 in addition to the shifts of the (OH) and the
ı(OH) bands of the MIL-53(Cr) hydroxyl groups provide evidence
that CO2 interacts with the O atoms of framework –OH groups as
an electron-acceptor via its carbon atom.
2.1.4. Cyclic CO2 adsorption and its impact on stability of MOFs
The cyclic and thermal stability of MOFs during adsorption/desorption is very important when connected to practical
application. The cyclic CO2 adsorption of MOF-5 prepared by
microwave synthesis showed that the uptake capacity is invariably
near 3.6 wt% when cycled between 30 and 300 ◦ C at atmospheric

pressure through 10 separate adsorption/desorption cycles. Above
400 ◦ C, however, MOF-5 underwent thermal decomposition and
was no longer capable of adsorbing CO2 [132]. Most of MOFs have
good thermal stability, but in terms of hydrothermal sensitivity,
a large number of MOFs, especially those constructed by Zn4 O
cluster nodes, decompose upon contact with humid air [133,134].
One subclass of MOFs, zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs), have
however been tested to be water and even acid stable, thereby
showing great potential in practical applications for CO2 capture
[84]. It should be pointed out that the synthesis of stable MOFs,
especially those being water stable, is still one of biggest challenges
in the research ﬁeld of MOFs for their practical applications.
2.1.5. CO2 storage in MOFs
The saturated adsorption measurements of CO2 at (or near)
room temperature and high pressure are directly related to the
ultimate storage capacity of MOFs for CO2 , which is another signiﬁcant issue in CCS. Table S2 lists selected MOFs with high CO2
storage capacities at near room temperature and high pressure. As
has been found with other gases, for CO2 storage, the total pore
volume of MOFs is essentially proportional to the amount of CO2
that can be adsorbed at high pressure; from Fig. 8, we can conclude
that surface area is also strongly correlated with the CO2 storage
ability.
Yaghi and coworkers [95] were the ﬁrst to report MOFs for CO2
storage at ambient conditions: nine MOFs were selected in order
to examine a range of structural and pore attributes. Since then,
several MOFs with high porosity and surface area have been examined for CO2 storage, with the initial record capacity changing from
MOF-177 to MIL-101 [135]. MOF-210, synthesized again by Yaghi’s
group currently holds the CO2 storage record with the saturated
CO2 uptake of 2400 mg/g at room temperature and ca. 50 bar [33].
This MOF has an estimated bulk density of 0.25 g/cm3 , a measured
pore volume of 3.60 cm3 /g and a BET surface area of 6240 m2 /g, the
highest reported for any crystalline material.
2.2. Co-adsorption, adsorption dynamics, and diffusion of CO2 in
MOFs
For the practical separation application of MOFs in CO2 capture,
the evaluation from co-adsorption and diffusion (dynamics) experiments are essential, unfortunately, however, only very limited data
have been reported to date.
2.2.1. CO2 co-adsorption in MOFs
The co-adsorption of CO2 and CH4 in ﬂexible MIL-53(Cr) has
been studied by Llewellyn and coworkers [136] using a combina-

1799

tion of several techniques. The results showed that CO2 -rich and
equimolar CO2 –CH4 mixtures lead to the structural transition, or
breathing, from the LP to the NP form and then back to the LP
form as the pressure was increased. CH4 -rich mixtures, on the other
hand, always maintain the LP framework. The closing and opening
of the structure is thus entirely controlled by the partial pressure
of CO2 , only a mild inﬂuence on the extent of the transition being
attributed to CH4 . Experimental results also suggested that CH4 is
probably not adsorbed at all in the NP-form (when it is ﬁlled with
CO2 ).
Multi-component ﬁxed-bed adsorption of CO2 , N2 , and CH4
(together with the adsorption kinetics) was conducted on crystals of Zn(bdc)(4,4 -bipy)0.5 (MOF-508b) [137]. Chen and coworkers
showed that MOF-508b is very selective for CO2 , and that the loadings of CH4 and N2 are temperature independent. A dynamic model
based on the linear driving force (LDF) approximation for mass
transfer was used to describe the adsorption kinetics of single,
binary, and ternary breakthrough curves. The intra-crystalline diffusivity for CO2 is one order of magnitude faster than that for CH4
and N2 .

2.2.2. Adsorption dynamics and diffusion of CO2 in MOFs
Adsorption dynamics of CO2 in Ni2 (4,4 -bipy)3 (NO3 )4 has been
explored by Thomas and coworkers [138]. The stepwise isotherm
that was observed from the CO2 adsorption at 10–20% occupancy
of the total pore volume of this MOF, was ascribed to discrete structural changes in the host framework that are induced by adsorption
on different sites. Detailed studies showed that the adsorption
kinetics obey a LDF mass transfer model for the adsorption at low
surface coverage. The rates of adsorption in the region of the CO2
isotherm steps are slower than those observed either before or after
each step. Salles et al. [139] examined the transport diffusivity of
CO2 in MIL-53(Cr) by using a combination of quasi-elastic neutron
scattering measurements and molecular dynamics simulations. The
results indicated that CO2 follows a one-dimensional (1D) diffusion mechanism in both the NP and LP structures of MIL-53(Cr).
They also used similar methods to characterize the self and transport diffusivities of CO2 in V(O)(bdc) (MIL-47(V)) [140]. As shown in
Fig. 9, Ds and Do monotonously decrease with an increase in loading,
whereas Dt exhibits a slight decrease at low loading followed by a
sharp increase at higher loading. In both MOFs, the magnitude of the
transport diffusivities was ∼10 m2 /s. Garcia-Ricard and HernandezMaldonado [141] evaluated the kinetics of CO2 adsorption on three
forms of Cu2 (pzdc)2 (4,4 -bipy) (pzdc = pyrazine-2,3-dicarboxylate)
pretreated at 373, 398, and 423 K. They used the adsorption
uptake to estimate the diffusion constant and elucidate the kinetics involved during the transport of CO2 through the micropores of
the material. Based on the determination of particle morphology
from scanning electron microscopy, the transport phenomenological model was used to ﬁt the adsorption data. Such as, for the sample
pretreated at 373 K, the analysis revealed an average diffusion time
constant of ca. 0.5 s−1 at 298 K. Lin and coworkers [142] examined the CO2 diffusion in cubic MOF-5 crystals, measuring about
40–60 ␮m in size. Their results showed that CO2 diffusion in MOF5 crystals is an activated process with the diffusion coefﬁcient being
in the range of 8.1–11.5 × 10−9 cm2 /s at 295–331 K and that the CO2
loading has almost no effect on the rate of the diffusion. Further
studies into the adsorption kinetics of CO2 in MOF-5 (and MOF177), performed by Deng and coworkers [143], indicated that at
298 K, MOF-5 and MOF-177 reached the adsorption saturation level
in an interval of time of about 5–10 s. The average diffusivities of the
gas onto MOF-5 and MOF-177 are 1.17 × 10−9 and 2.3 × 10−9 m2 /s
at 298 K and pressures up to 800 Torr, with a marked slowing as
pressure increased. The diffusion related to MOF-based membranes
will be discussed in Section 3 of this paper.

2.3. Selective adsorption of CO2 in MOFs
As mentioned above, CCS related gas separation primarily
includes CO2 /N2 separation in post-combustion capture, CO2 /H2
separation in pre-combustion capture, air (O2 /N2 ) and CO2 /CO
separation in oxy-combustion, and CO2 /CH4 separation in the
puriﬁcation of natural gas. In the majority of reported literature,
selective adsorption is the primary tool used give the reader
a guided view of a particular MOF’s potential for separation.
In selective adsorption, both the adsorption capacity and the
selectivity are the central concerns. Selective adsorption, in most
cases, uses single-component isotherms and the Ideal Adsorbed
Solution Theory (IAST) [144] to calculate a material’s selectivity
factor. However, as the name indicates, the calculation does
not always account for all experimental variables, and should
be viewed as a reference; gas mixture adsorption experiments
should thus be conducted, to complete the picture. The selective
adsorption of CO2 over CH4 and N2 on single-component (in most
cases) and mixed-gas experiments, of the reported MOFs has been
summarized in Tables 1 and 2, respectively.
2.3.1. Direction observation of CO2 selective adsorption in MOFs
From the single-component adsorption isotherm the CO2
selective adsorption over other gases has been observed in some
MOFs. Generally speaking, the selective adsorption of CO2 over
N2 or CH4 in rigid MOFs can be attributed to either size exclusion
or a favorable gas–pore surface interaction. These factors are
determined by the sizes and properties of both the gas adsorbates
and the pores in a given MOF. Compared to N2 and CH4 the
kinetic diameter of CO2 is smaller and its quadrupole moment is
higher, which, in many cases, results in strong interactions with
the pore surface of the adsorbents. Based on the size exclusion,
several MOFs including Er2 (pda)3 (pda = 1,4-phenylendiacetate)
[200], Mn(HCOO)2 [183], Cd3 (OH)2 (apta)4 [196], Cu(fma)(bpee)0.5
[175], Co[Fe(Tp)(CN)3 ]2 [191], [Cu5 (Tz)9 ](NO3 ) [192], and Zn(dtp)
(Fig. 10) [171] have shown selective adsorption of CO2 over
N2 at low temperature and atmospheric pressure; additionally,
size-selective adsorption of CO2 over CH4 has also been observed
in Mn(HCO2 )2 [183]. Besides these, a number of rigid MOFs have
the capability to selectively adsorb CO2 over N2 and CH4 because
of the strong interaction between CO2 and their pore surface
[94,106,126,135,141,146,148,151,153–157,159,162–166,168–172,
,179,181,182,184,186,188–191,193,194,196–198,201–204]. Based
on the collected data, all examined MOFs adsorbed very low quantities of N2 at room temperature, implying that increasing the CO2

) as a function of CO2 concentration (b) of

adsorption capacity is a straightforward strategy for enhancing the
selectivity of CO2 over N2 (at this condition).
Flexible MOFs have a different story in the selective adsorption
of CO2 over CH4 or N2 . A typical example is Cu(dhbc)2 (4,4 -bipy),
which has a different “gate” opening pressures for CO2 , N2 , and
CH4 (Fig. 11) [114]. At different pressure ranges these gases can be
selectively adsorbed by this MOF, which shows the potential for
playing a role as a multi-functional adsorbent of this material. A
similar “gate” phenomenon for the selective adsorption of these
gases has also been observed in Zn(pydc)(dma) [158]. Another
interesting MOF with a high CO2 adsorption selectivity that has
been associated with framework ﬂexibility is (Ni2 )(dpce)(bptc)
(SNU-M10,
dpce = 1,2-di(1,3,5,8,12-pentaazacyclotetradecan-3yl)ethane, bptc = 1,1 -biphenyl-3,3 ,5,5 -tetracarboxylate) [205].
Choi and Suh showed that the adsorption selectivity of SNU-M10
for CO2 over N2 at room temperature is pressure-dependent,
having a selectivity of 24:1 (v/v) at 0.61 atm and 98:1 (v/v) at
1.0 atm. They attributed this phenomenon to CO2 -induced “gate”
opening and closing of pores.
2.3.2. Evaluation of CO2 adsorption selectivity in MOFs
Besides the direct observation on differences in uptakes
between separated gases under given measurement conditions
to give the qualitative evaluation, the single-component adsorption isotherms can also be used to quantitatively estimate the
adsorption selectivity. Two methods are usually used to assess the
adsorption selectivity, in terms of the single-component adsorption data. If adsorption species are presented at low loadings,
namely within the Henry’s regime, the adsorption selectivity for
an equimolar mixture is close to the ratio of the Henry’s constants
for each species as if it were adsorbed as a pure component [206].
At non-dilute loadings, however, more information is required to
estimate multi-component adsorption. One common approach is
to use well-developed Ideal Adsorbed Solution Theory (IAST) [144]
to predict multi-component adsorption isotherms and selectivity
based on single-component adsorption isotherms. This approximate theory is known to work accurately in many porous materials,
including MOFs [207,208]. However, most of the reports on CO2
selective adsorption in MOFs are based on simulated adsorption
isotherms, which will be discussed in another part of this paper.
Limited adsorption selectivities of CO2 over other gases in
MOFs evaluated from experiments were reported recently. Deng
and coworkers [143] reported the adsorption equilibrium selectivity of CO2 over N2 and CH4 in MOF-5 and MOF-177, which
were calculated from the ratio of Henry’s constants. The results

same method to calculate the CO2 adsorption selectivities of ZIF100 and ZIF-95, resulting in values of 6, 4, and 17 and 11, 25, and 18
over CH4 , CO, and N2 , respectively [210]. Furthermore, this method
has also been used in Cu(bdc-OH) [146] and Zn4 (OH)2 (1,2,4-btc)2
[186], for evaluating the respective CO2 /CH4 adsorption selectivity.

Using experimental single-component adsorption isotherms
to calculate the adsorption selectivity of a multi-component
mixture by IAST has been pioneered by Snurr and Hupp in the
MOF ﬁeld. They studied the selective adsorption of CO2 over N2
in several modiﬁed MOFs based on the Zn2 (bttb)(X)2 (X = pyridine
substitutes) parent framework [159]. For Zn2 (bttb)(CF3 -py)2
(py = pyridine), the best one in terms of selectivity, their results
showed that the selectivity increases with decreasing pressure of
CO2 , and in fact surpasses the selectivities reported for zeolite and
carbon adsorbents under similar conditions. They also found that,
the selectivity increases as N2 content, y(N2 ) approaches unity,
but does not depend on the gas composition at zero coverage.
In the case of y(N2 ) = 0.85, conditions resembling ﬂue gas, the
selectivity was in the range of 25–45; fairly high selectivities of

17–41 were found even at equimolar mixtures of CO2 and N2 .
Several other MOFs have also been evaluated for the selective
adsorption and separation of CO2 over CH4 [166,211,109,172]
by them. For Zn2 (2,6-ndc)2 (dpni) (the microwave-synthesized
sample), a selectivity of ∼30 of CO2 over CH4 was found, with
rapidly increasing values as the gas-phase mole fraction of CH4 ,
y(CH4 ) approaches unity [172]. At y(CH4 ) = 0.95, extremely high
selectivities of 8–67 were obtained. Even at y(CH4 ) = 0.5, the selectivity was in the range of 4–30. Similarly, for Zn3 (OH)(p-cdc)2.5 ,
the selectivity was in the range of 7–31 at a mole fraction of 0.95
of CH4 [166]. The same approach has also been used by Walton
and coworkers [154] to evaluate the adsorption selectivity of
an equimolar CO2 /CH4 mixture in Cu2 (Hbtb)2 over a range of
pressures, giving higher values of 12.4 at 1 bar and decreasing with

increasing bulk pressure to 5 at 20 bar. Recently, Bai and coworkers
[198] reported the CO2 /N2 selectivities of 33 and 22 at 298 K and
20 bar for Zn5 (bta)6 (tda)2 and Cu3 (btei) [PCN-61], respectively
(calculated using the same method).
Some reports have approximated the adsorption selectivity factors by comparing the adsorption capacity of single-component
adsorption isotherms. Chaffee and coworkers [156] calculated the
adsorption selectivities of CO2 /N2 and CO2 /CH4 in HKUST-1 from
the single gas isotherms by dividing the CO2 adsorption capacity by
that of N2 or CH4 at each pressure point. Their results showed that
the selectivity towards CO2 at 25 ◦ C decreases slowly as pressure
is increased. Long and coworkers [126] evaluated the adsorption
selectivity of CO2 over N2 in Fe-BTT, resulting in a separation factor
of approximately 5.5:1 at room temperature. Rosi and coworkers
[190] reported the CO2 /N2 adsorption selectivity of 81:1 at 273 K
and 75:1 at 298 K for Co2 (ad)2 (OAc)2 (bio-MOF-11) as the ratios
of the initial slopes of the CO2 and N2 single-component adsorption isotherms. The similar method has also been used by Yaghi
and coworker [157] in series of ZIFs for their CO2 /CH4 , CO2 /N2 , and
CO2 /O2 adsorption selectivities. Furthermore, Grande and coworkers [168] reported the selectivity of CO2 /CH4 in HKUST-1 ranging
from 4 to 6 at a pressure range of 0.1–3 bar. These estimations for
adsorption selectivity have the same theoretical base as those using
the ratio of the Henry’s constants mentioned above; all are based
on single-component adsorption isotherms.

all results are based on the direct observation of adsorption
isotherms. One MOF of particular interest, Cr3 (btc)2 , reported
recently by Long and coworkers [213], displayed both a high O2
loading capacity and strong selective binding of O2 over N2 at
298 K. This can be attributed to the chemical adsorption of O2 by
coordination to open Cr(II) sites.
Experimental selective adsorption of CO2 over H2 has been
reported for Zn2 (Atz)(ox) [128,129], Zn(3,3 -tpdc)(dabco) [189],
Zn(Me-Im)2 (ZIF-8, Im = Imidazolate) [151], HKUST-1 [156], and
Sc2 (bdc)3 [106]. Due to the weak interactions between H2 and most
pore surfaces, MOFs in general have the ability to selectively adsorb
CO2 over H2 if the pore size is large enough for CO2 pass.
Selective adsorption of CO2 over CO was reported in several
ZIFs and functionalized MOF-5. The details of these results can
be found in a recent review contributed by Yaghi and coworkers
[84] and also in the breakthrough experiments discussed below.
Recently, they also examined multi-functional MOF-5, MTV-MOF5-EI and MTV-MOF-5-EHI for the selective adsorption of CO2 over
CO [214]. The former has an adsorption capacity of 22 vs 2.7 and
the latter has a capacity of 37 vs 3 cm3 /cm3 for CO2 and CO at
298 K and 800 Torr. Compared with MOF-5, which has an uptake
ratio of 11.5:2.5 cm3 /cm3 for CO2 to CO under similar conditions,
the selective uptake capacity of the two functional MOFs increases
signiﬁcantly (400% better in the case of MTV-MOF-5-EHI).

2.3.3. Other related gas selective adsorption in MOFs
The selective adsorption of O2 over N2 was reported in
several MOFs, including UMCM-1 [148] and Sc2 (bdc)3 [106]
at ambient temperature, Co3 (2,4-pdc)2 ( 3 -OH)2 (CUK-1)
[176], Mg(tcpbda) [164], Zn(dtp) [171], and Zn4 O(adc)3 (H2 O)3
(adc = 9,10-anthracenedicarboxylate) [212] at low temperature;

Experimental results on the adsorptive separation of gas mixture containing CO2 in MOFs are limited in the literature. Among
various separation methods the breakthrough experiment and gas
chromatographic separation are simple and straightforward in the
evaluation of the separation. The process of breakthrough exper-

iment consists of exposing a “bed” packed with the adsorbent to
a mixed-gas stream, typically two components and then detecting
the ‘breakthrough’ of the components from the adsorbent bed. The
difference in breakthrough times of two gases is representative of
the adsorbent’s selectivity. The adsorbed amounts of each gas can
be estimated by integration of the breakthrough curves. An average selectivity is then deﬁned as the ratio of the adsorbed amounts
normalized by the initial composition of the gas mixture [91].

2.4.1. Breakthrough experiments on CO2 separation in MOFs
Some breakthrough experiments on CO2 separation in MOFs
have been performed and gave qualitative evaluations in most
cases. Yaghi and coworkers examined several ZIFs for CO2 separation by breakthrough experiments. It was determined that for
ZIF-68, -69, and -70 using binary mixtures of CO2 /CO at room temperature [209], for ZIF-78 and -82 using CO2 /CH4 [157], and for
ZIF-95 and -100 using streams containing CO2 /CH4 , CO2 /CO, or
CO2 /N2 [210] these MOFs are feasible for the separation of CO2
from other gases and have longer retention times for CO2 than
BPL Carbon under the same conditions. Besides these ZIFs, several
other MOFs have also been tested by breakthrough experiments
for their performance in CO2 separation. Yaghi’s group performed
the tests using a 20% mixture of CO2 in CH4 on Mg2 (dhtp) (MgMOF-74) [215]. As shown in Fig. 12, the adsorption for CO2 in this
MOF is highly preferred over CH4 a dynamic capacity of 8.9 wt% CO2
uptake, higher than that of zeolite NaX under similar conditions.
To test the effect of the metal ion on CO2 adsorption, they also
performed CO2 breakthrough in isostructural Zn-MOF-74, which
took up just 0.35 wt% CO2 , a reduction of 96% compared to MgMOF-74. In the same time period, Dietzel et al. studied CPO-27-M
(M = Ni, Mg), i.e. Ni-MOF-74 and Mg-MOF-74, for the separation
of CO2 /N2 and CO2 /CH4 mixtures by breakthrough experiments,
giving similar results of preferential adsorption of CO2 [155].
Breakthrough experiments have also been performed on the
MIL-53 series. This class of materials has a bistable structure, as
described above, with a narrow pores at low CO2 pressures and
a larger pores at higher CO2 pressures [104,216]. Denayer and
coworkers [217] studied the separation of CO2 /CH4 mixtures using
a ﬁxed-bed packed with MIL-53(Al). Because the adsorption of CO2
in MIL-53(Al) at higher pressures leads to expansion of the framework and an increase in the adsorbed amount of both gases, the
CO2 selectivity decreased from ca. 7 to ca. 4 at pressures above
5 bar. They also examined amine-functionalized MIL-53(Al) [98],
concluding that CH4 travels rapidly through the column, while only
weakly adsorbing to the pore walls and without causing framework
contraction, whereas CO2 adsorbs and can replaces pre-adsorbed
CH4 molecules. A mass-balance calculation showed that essentially
no CH4 was adsorbed while 0.83 mmol/g of CO2 was adsorbed at

1 bar. In addition, the pulse chromatography experiment generated a retention time of 5.7 min for CO2 but less than 5 s for CH4
at 30 ◦ C and a very low degree of pore ﬁlling. Similarly, Llewellyn
and coworkers tested MIL-53(Cr) for separation of a mixture containing CO2 and CH4 resulting in selectivities ranging from 2 to 16,
depending on the fraction of CO2 [136].
Chen and coworkers [137,165] examined MOF-508b for its
performance in the separation and removal of CO2 from binary
CO2 /N2 and CO2 /CH4 and ternary CO2 /CH4 /N2 mixtures by ﬁxedbed adsorption. The separation efﬁciency was rationalized and
compared in terms of the sorption selectivity, S (S = q1/q2, where
component 1 is more adsorbed). The results indicated that SCO2 /CH4
and SCO2 /N2 of this MOF are moderate (3–6) at 303 K, which is lower
than the selectivity of activated carbon, and decreases with increasing temperature.
2.4.2. Gas chromatographic separation of CO2 in MOFs
Gas chromatography is an alternative experimental method
used for the evaluation of gas separation in an adsorbent. Chang
and coworkers [176] reported the gas chromatographic separation
of a gas mixture composed of H2 /O2 /N2 /CH4 /CO2 (0.6:2:28:10:27,
mol%) by passing it through a column packed with CUK-1. The
clear separation demonstrated that this material is potent in the
separation of a complex mixture such as here containing ﬁve
gases. A second example was reported recently by Navarro and
coworkers [218], in which the possible utility of an ionic MOF,
A[Cu3 ( 3 -OH)( 3 -4-carboxypyrazolato)3 ] (A = NH4 + or Et3 NH+ )
for gas separation was examined (Fig. 13). In their work, variabletemperature pulse gas chromatography experiments were carried
out in the temperature range of 273–363 K with a gas mixture containing N2 , CH4 , CO2 , and C2 H2 . The results revealed that these
materials have strong interactions with CO2 and C2 H2 , whereas
the interactions with N2 and CH4 are negligible, thus solidifying
the effectiveness of ionic MOFs as a viable option for gas separation
of CO2 from N2 and CH4 .
3. MOF-based membranes for CO2 separation
As mentioned in a previous section, absorption and adsorptive
separation processes for CO2 capture, such as amine absorption and
PSA or TSA separate gases usually based on differences in thermodynamic solubility [5,22,219]. Membrane-based gas separation
is an attractive alternative to both of processes for a number of
reasons [220–222]. Firstly, membrane separation is a passive separation and involves no moving parts, making it a far less energy
consumptive process comparatively. Secondly, membrane separation is a continuous process, making membrane modules a more
attractive option for plant retroﬁtting. Thirdly and perhaps most
importantly, membrane separation takes advantage not only of

differences in solubility of the chemicals to be separated but also
of differences in diffusivity, thereby potentially achieving higher
selectivity for a given separation [91]. Many investigators have
turned their attention to membranes for CO2 capture and, as indicated by the number of recent publications, interest is still growing
(see Fig. 14).
3.1. Current CO2 separation membranes
Efforts to study membranes for CO2 separation have generally
focused on a few different classes of materials such as polymers,
zeolites, and their derivatives (e.g. silicoaluminophosphates), and
facilitated transport (often immobilized liquid) membranes. Pure
polymer membranes for CO2 separation have a few distinct advantages over other materials, such as very low production cost and
generally high gas ﬂuxes. However, traditional polymer membranes suffer from low CO2 /N2 selectivity (less than 100). For
membrane-based separation to be economically viable, the CO2 /N2
selectivity has to be in the range of 200 [23]. Plasticization (depression of the glass transition temperature usually accompanied by
drastic changes in membrane properties) in the presence of CO2 is
also a serious issue for polymeric materials. A number of reviews
of polymeric membranes are available and the interested reader
should turn their attention there [77,220,222–224].
Another class of materials that have been studied for membranes for CO2 separation are zeolites and their derivatives. Zeolites
are well known for their high chemical and thermal stability. Their
rigid pore structure generally affords very high selectivities as has
been demonstrated for many zeolite membranes [225,226]. Despite

the potential of these materials for molecular sieve membranes,
zeolites are limited for use in CO2 /N2 separation due to the sim˚ and N2 (3.6 A)
˚ and
ilarity of the kinetic diameters of CO2 (3.3 A)
the limited pore sizes available for zeolites. The interested reader
should direct their attention to several excellent zeolite membranerelated reviews [227–229].
Facilitated transport membranes have also been reported for
CO2 separation [230–234]. These membranes rely on a carrier
molecule (metallic ions or liquid amines for example) with a special
CO2 afﬁnity to achieve selective CO2 transport. Many of these membranes are immobilized liquids supported by polymeric or ceramic
porous supports. The highest CO2 /N2 selectivities observed to date
have been reported for these kinds of membranes [234]. Immobilized liquid membranes are promising because of the high selectivities reported, but could face challenges with long-term stability.
Mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) consist of a continuous
phase (polymer) and a homogeneously distributed discrete phase
(typically inorganic particles). The purpose of including inorganic
particles is to enhance the properties of the polymer phase. MMMs
are promising materials for CO2 capture because of their potential
to marry the strengths of two different materials (e.g. the ﬂexibility and low cost of the polymer phase with the high selectivity
of the ﬁller phase). However, MMMs face similar challenges to
pure polymeric membranes for CO2 capture such as plasticization
in the presence of CO2 in addition to the difﬁculties speciﬁc to
MMMs such as preventing non-selective void spaces around ﬁller
particles. Several reports discussing these materials, their challenges and strategies for overcoming those challenges are available
[77,235–238].
Despite the progress made with traditional materials as membranes for CO2 capture, challenges such as insufﬁcient CO2 /N2
selectivity and low CO2 permeability remain. Consequently there is
a great need for new materials to help answer some of these challenges. As mentioned in previous sections, MOFs have been noted
for their chemical functionalizeability and pore size tailorability
[24,239,240]. These properties along with their regular pore structure make MOFs exciting candidates for CO2 capture as membrane
materials.
3.2. MOF-based membranes
MOF-based membrane for gas separation is an emerging ﬁeld
with only a few reports that include gas permeation data available to date [241–253], only one of which speciﬁcally discusses the
membrane’s potential for CO2 capture [248]. Challenges associated
with MOF membrane fabrication such as poor substrate–MOF interaction [244], moisture instability [254], and easy microscopic and

macroscopic crack formation [246] present hurdles to the investigation of these materials as membranes for CO2 capture. These
challenges can mainly be attributed to the coordination bond in the
MOF structure. In general, metal–ligand coordination bonds are not
as kinetically strong as covalent bonds, resulting in moisture instability (water replacing carboxylates) and crack formation. Zeolite
membranes, for example, do not require any kind of slow cooling
steps or careful drying during fabrication to prevent crack formation due to the strong Si–O covalent bonds in the zeolite structure.
A number of synthesis techniques for MOF membranes have
been reported and can be broken down into two broad categories: (1) in situ synthesis (synthesis on supports without seed
crystals) [241,243,245,248–250,252] and (2) seeded (secondary)
growth [242,246,247,251,255]. In situ growth is simple and involves
only one synthesis step to produce membranes, but does not have
the same microstructure control and substrate independence that
secondary growth affords. MOF membranes have been reported
using conventional [241,248] and microwave induced [245] in
situ growth of bare supports, solvothermal growth on a supporting copper net [243], solvothermal growth on supports modiﬁed
with organic linkers [249], and supports modiﬁed with aminopropyltriethoxysilane [250,252]. For secondary growth methods,
the most important step is seed crystal attachment to the support prior to solvothermal membrane synthesis. Some reported
seed crystal attachment methods include microwave induced thermal deposition [242], seed attachment with polymer binders
[244,247,251,255], and seed attachment using thermal deposition
(thermal seeding) [246].
MOFs, in general, are not known for their detailed thermal and
chemical stability. A notable exception to this is ZIFs [248,256].
ZIF-8 and ZIF-69 are particularly interesting for CO2 capture in
industrial settings as they have been demonstrated to maintain
their crystal structure in harsh environments such as boiling water,
boiling benzene, and supercritical CO2 [248,256].
3.3. MOF membranes for CO2 separation
Due to the newness of this ﬁeld of research, there are currently
no MOF membranes speciﬁcally studied for CO2 /N2 separation.
However, many of these initial MOF membrane reports have
included single gas permeation data for common gases including
CO2 and N2 . This data is summarized in Table 3.
3.3.1. Pure MOF-based membranes for CO2 separation
The ﬁrst metal-organic framework membranes were reported
as recently as early 2009 [241,242]. These membranes are well-

intergrown and randomly oriented polycrystalline MOF ﬁlms
consisting of IRMOF-1 crystals (see Fig. 15). They exhibited Knudsen diffusion for small gas molecules due to the large pore size
˚ [241,242]. Also in 2009, Zhu and coworkof IRMOF-1 (∼14.5 A)
ers [243] demonstrated an essentially freestanding membrane of
HKUST-1, grown on oxidized copper nets. The copper mesh acted
both as physical supports and as an extra copper source for the MOF
crystallization. The membrane exhibited good separation selectivity for H2 /N2 (∼7.04) and better permeation ﬂux than conventional
zeolite membranes, but due to its freestanding nature it may
face long-term mechanical stability problem. Jeong and coworkers
[246] recently reported HKUST-1 membranes fabricated on porous
␣-alumina supports using secondary growth of deposited HKUST1 nanocrsytals. These HKUST-1 membranes exhibited comparable
gas separation properties to that previously reported by Zhu and
coworkers [243].
Ranjan and Tsapatsis [244] demonstrated a gas separating membrane of Cu(hﬁpbb)(H2 hﬁpbb)0.5 (H2 hﬁpbb = 4,4 (hexaﬂuoroisopropylidene)-bis(benzoic acid)) [258], a microporous MOF (MMOF) in 2009. As seen in Fig. 16, this membrane
exhibited moderate to high ideal selectivity for H2 /N2 (∼4 at room
temperature and ∼23 at 190 ◦ C) but with relatively poor permeation ﬂux. The poor ﬂux can be attributed to pore blocking from
randomly oriented seed crystals. The ﬁrst ZIF membrane was also
reported in 2009 [245]. This membrane exhibited good H2 /CH4
selectivity (11.2 for a 1:1 mixture) at room temperature, indicating the molecular sieving effect (preferential permeation of small
molecules).
Jeong and coworkers [249] recently reported the ﬁrst MOF
membranes (ZIF-8) with controlled microstructures. These membranes have well-intergrown or poorly intergrown structures
depending on the presence or absence of a common base (sodium
formate) and the choice of metal salt in growth (see Fig. 17). ZIF-7
membranes were also reported recently [247,251]. These membranes exhibited negligible ideal selectivity for CO2 /N2 which is
˚ is smaller than the
unsurprising as the pore size of ZIF-7 (∼3 A)
kinetic diameter of both CO2 and N2 . ZIF-22 membranes were
reported which exhibit similar CO2 /N2 separation properties to ZIF7 [250]. In addition, c-oriented ZIF-69 membrane fabricated on a
porous ␣-alumina was reported by Lai and coworkers [248]. This
report tested the chemical stability of ZIF-69 membrane by immersing it in various boiling solvents for 7 days and then checking
the membrane crystallinity. The membrane maintained their crystal structure in boiling benzene, boiling methanol, boiling water,
and supercritical CO2 indicating their potential suitability for CO2
capture in real environments. Despite the large pore size of ZIF-

˚ this membrane exhibited CO2 permeance better than
69 (∼7.8 A),
expected for Knudsen diffusion. The CO2 /CO mixture permselectivity of this membrane was 3.5 at room temperature. The CO2
permeability when measured as a single component is equivalent
to that of a zeolite membrane with similar pore size (zeolite Y)
[259]. However, when CO2 permeability was measured in binary
mixture it was about 5 times higher for the ZIF-69 membrane. This
indicates that this membrane exhibits preferential adsorption of
CO2 and may be useful for CO2 capture. A ZIF-90 membrane was
also reported which has selectivity properties similar to ZIF-7 [252].
Most recently a membrane of MIL-53 was reported which exhibits
Knudsen diffusion for small gases [257].
3.3.2. Mixed matrix membranes using MOFs as the discrete phase
for CO2 separation
Mixed matrix membrane (MMM) using MOFs as the ﬁller material is also a new area of research and there are also only a

very few reports available [260–265]. Koros and coworkers [262]
reported an MMM comprised of poly(vinyl acetate) (PVAc) and
a MOF composed of copper and terephthalic acid (Cu–TPA). This
membrane exhibited increased selectivity for many gases, including CO2 upon inclusion of the MOF compared to the pure PVAc
membrane. The ideal selectivity of pure PVAc for CO2 /N2 is ∼32
and for 15% CuTPA–PVAc is ∼35. All gases were tested at 65 psia
(∼4 atm) except for CO2 which was tested at 1.35 psia (∼0.09 atm)
to prevent plasticization. Musselman and coworkers [263] reported
the ﬁrst ZIF-based polymer MMM using ZIF-8 as the ﬁller phase and
Matrimid® as the polymer phase. Inclusion of the ZIF phase had
substantial impact on the membrane selectivity. Pure Matrimid®
exhibited an ideal selectivity for CO2 /CH4 of ∼43, and at 50% loading of ZIF crystals the ideal selectivity increased to ∼124. Binary gas
measurements of 10:90 CO2 /CH4 also showed selectivity enhancement; pure Matrimid® gave selectivity of ∼42, and at 50% loading
the selectivity increased to ∼89.

3.4. Potential MOF structures for membrane-based CO2
separation
When contemplating potential MOFs to investigate for CO2 capture membranes, many properties in addition to CO2 adsorption
afﬁnity must be considered, such as pore size, pore structure, stability in humid environments, and thermal stability. Choosing a
MOF with the appropriate pore size to differentiate gases is not
as straightforward as it may seem since the framework structure
of MOFs used in MOF membranes has been observed to be rather
ﬂexible [245,247]. This is particularly noticeable in a recent report
of a ZIF-90 membrane [252]. According to crystallographic data,
˚ which should be a good size to difthe pore size of ZIF-90 is 3.5 A,
ferentiate CO2 and N2 . However, at least according to single gas
measurements, this membrane’s selectivity for these gases is negligible likely due to framework ﬂexibility. However the poor CO2 /N2
ideal selectivity of this membrane may also be attributed in part to
non-selective inter-crystalline diffusion through grain boundaries
as observed in zeolite membranes [226].
Based on their unusual stability and the range of pore sizes available [209,256], ZIFs seem to have good potential for CO2 capture
membranes. Recent results for ZIF membranes with pore aperture
size of 3.0 A˚ (ZIF-7 [247,251] and ZIF-22 [250]) indicated that even
˚ can still appreciably
relatively large molecules, such as CH4 (3.8 A)
permeate through the membrane, implying that it may be worthwhile to pursue those ZIFs with smaller aperture. For examples,
ZIF-64 has aperture size of 2.5 A˚ [209] and ZIF-74 and -75 have even
˚ ZIF-74 and ZIF-75 have the added
smaller aperture sizes of 1.2 A.
advantage of using asymmetric ligands, a property recently noted
for increasing CO2 afﬁnity [266].
Another potential strategy to follow would be incorporating
bulkier, less ﬂexible organic ligands into the MOF matrix. One
would expect that this would dramatically enhance the molecular
sieving effect in membranes of such MOFs.

Apart from the potential MOFs mentioned above, there are
stimuli-responsive MOFs whose structures, thereby properties,
change reversibly upon external stimuli such as temperature
[115,116] and gas adsorption [105]. This offers unique opportunities for membrane-based gas separation including CO2 capture
by controlling gas diffusion/adsorption properties. One such material is mesh adjustable molecular sieves (MAMS), which are a class
of MOFs that proposed to (probably) exhibit temperature tunable
molecular gates within their pores [115,116]. These gates afford
control over the gases absorbed into the material by discriminating based on molecular size; a property that is of particular interest
for membrane-based CO2 separation. A membrane capable of continuously adjusting its pore size would be useful not only for high
resolution separation of similar gases such as CO2 /N2 but for its
market ﬂexibility (a single membrane could be used to achieve separation of many different gas mixtures). Another important feature
of MAMS is that although the molecular gates within the structure open and close with temperature change, the lattice constants
do not. This means that, unlike previously reported titanosilicate
molecular sieves [267], the MAMS unit cell is unaffected by the
molecular gating effect [115]. Recent reports [115,116] described
MAMS in powder or crystalline form, however no reports exist
describing MAMS ﬁlms or membranes. Development of MAMS
membranes could open the way for transformative separation technology, such as membrane units for gas separation made up of
consecutive MAMS membrane modules at increasing temperatures
as illustrated in Fig. 18.

4. Computational approaches of CO2 adsorption and
separation in MOFs
In addition to enormous experimental efforts, advances in
computational power have allowed molecular simulation to play

a signiﬁcant role in the investigation and prediction of MOF’s
properties and potential applications. By providing microscopic
information that sometimes is not accessible or difﬁcult to obtain
with experiment, simulations complement the experiment. In
addition, simulations are extremely useful to evaluate adsorption
performance not only of real materials but also of hypothetical
materials based on the atomistic model of their structures. In conjunction with experiments, simulations also play an important role
on the rational design of new materials (MOFs) for speciﬁc applications. Based on these advantages, computer simulations have been
used to study MOFs applications, such as in CO2 adsorption and
separation.
4.1. Simulation methods
The main molecular simulation techniques used for the investigation of CO2 adsorption and separation in MOFs are ab initio
and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, Grand Canonical
Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations, and molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations.
4.1.1. Ab initio and density functional theory (DFT)
Ab initio and density functional theory (DFT) methods are normally implemented when detailed information regarding chemical
and physical interactions is required. During the past years, ab initio and DFT calculations have been employed extensively to study,
for example, speciﬁc adsorption sites, interaction mechanisms,
and interaction energies between MOFs and small gas molecules,
including H2 [268–271], CH4 [272,273], and CO2 [100,274–277]. In
contrast to H2 and CH4 , CO2 has a signiﬁcant quadrupole moment,
which induces its speciﬁc interactions with MOFs, such as much
higher binding energy with open metal sites in MOFs, hydrogen bonding, and so on. In quantum-based simulations, the DFT
method has been widely used from small clusters to large systems
because it includes electron correlation effects and shows exceptional computational efﬁciency. Among different DFT methods, the
widely used B3LYP can normally give a good approximation of
binding geometries, which is comparable with high level ab initio methods. However, DFT has some deﬁciencies when applied to
systems with weak interactions, such as dispersion interactions.

1809

In comparison with DFT, high level ab initio methods, such as second order Moller–Plesset (MP2) [278] show superiority in treating
dispersion interaction in weakly bonded systems and give more
accurate results [273]. However, MP2 is computational expensive
and only affordable for small systems. Considering both calculation time and accuracy, the combinations of high level ab initio
and DFT or low level ab initio was the optimal choice for investigations of these “big” MOF systems [273]. In addition to MP2,
some newly developed techniques including GGA-DFT [279] and
MP2-DFT [280] are also available to treat systems with longrange dispersion interactions and provide good results for binding
geometries and energies [281,282]. To get reliable binding energy
results, basis set superposition error (BSSE) [283] should be corrected to avoid overestimating the interaction energies between
MOFs and CO2 [273,276,282]. It has been found that BSSE shows
strong effects on adsorption energy obtained from the MP2 method
[284]. However, DFT only shows relatively small dependences on
BSSE [285].
Another important role of DFT calculations in CO2 adsorption
and separation in MOFs is to provide force constants and atomic
charges for molecular simulations. For example, calculated atomic
point charges can be used to develop force ﬁelds (FFs) for classical
simulations. B3LYP is frequently applied in MOFs since it provides
better descriptions of transition metals. Regarding the selection of
basis sets, to balance simulation accuracy and computation time,
6-31+G(d) or 6-31G(d) is normally used for light atoms [286,287],
while the effective core potential (ECP) basis sets are often chosen
for heavy atoms. LANL2DZ is one of the most common ECP basis sets
for complexes involving transition metal elements [288]. There are
a couple of approaches available to evaluate atomic charges, such
as Mulliken population analysis [289], the electrostatic potential
(ESP) [290], the restrained electrostatic potential (RESP) [291], the
charges from electrostatic potentials using a grid (CHELPG) [292],
and the recently developed REPEAT method [293].
4.1.2. Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC)
Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) has been recognized as
one of the most extensively used techniques to study gas adsorption
properties of MOFs, such as gas uptake and the heats of adsorption.
In GCMC, simulations are conducted at ﬁxed chemical potential of
the molecules, temperature, and volume [294,295]. GCMC is suitable to study guest molecule adsorption because it models a system
at equilibrium, where the chemical potentials of the adsorbate in
adsorbed and bulk phases are equal. Each Monte Carlo simulation
involves four types of movement of adsorbates: insertions, deletions, displacements, and rotations to achieve equilibrium of the
system. The results are then averaged over the run of simulations.
With a series of simulations at different pressures, the adsorption
isotherms can be obtained by relating the chemical potential and
gas phase pressure through an equation of state. This technique,
however, often suffers convergent problems when the probability
of particle creation in a dense phase is low.
The input of GCMC simulation includes separation of models for
adsorbate and adsorbent, and force ﬁeld to describe the interactions
between them. In most simulations, it is assumed that the frameworks are rigid and the periodic boundary conditions are normally
applied to mimic the crystalline periodicity thus avoiding boundary or ﬁnite size effects [296]. To date, only few simulation studies
have been performed in the adsorption of ﬂexible MOFs [216,297].
To model the adsorbate–adsorbate interactions, Lennard–Jones (LJ)
potential is generally used in ﬁrst-approximation. The force ﬁeld
parameters can be obtained by ﬁtting the LJ potential to experimental vapor–liquid equilibrium data. The early investigation normally
uses a sphere model to describe small molecules, such as CO2 [298].
However, more accurate potential models are more commonly
used today, where both the van der Waals (normally modeled by

1810

J.-R. Li et al. / Coordination Chemistry Reviews 255 (2011) 1791–1823

LJ potential) and the Coulombic interactions are considered. The
new model of CO2 generally consists of three LJ sites (two O and
one C atom sites) with charges located on each site to describe
its intrinsic quadrupole moment [299–301]. In a more complex
model to describe CO2 · · ·CO2 interactions, the angle of O–C–O in
CO2 is not ﬁxed and allowed to vary to mimic bond bending of
CO2 [299,302]. Similarly, adsorbate–adsorbent interactions are also
modeled as a combination of LJ and Coulombic potentials. To date,
many GCMC simulations of gas adsorption on MOFs have employed
general-purpose force ﬁelds, including the universal force ﬁeld
(UFF) [303], DREIDING [304], and optimized potential for liquid
simulations-all atom (OPLS-AA) [305] models, which include the
force ﬁeld parameters for the atoms in most of the periodic table.
These empirical force ﬁelds were mainly developed for covalent
bonds between atoms so it gives only approximate predictions of
interaction energy for non-bonded interactions, such as the interaction between gas molecules and MOF’s pore surface. As a result,
inaccurate gas adsorption properties are often generated with the
empirical force ﬁelds [306]. In addition, because a wide range of
possible inorganic (inorganic-organic) fragments are involved in
MOFs, the force ﬁeld parameters for these new fragments are not
available in some cases. It limits the investigations in the screening and design of MOFs for speciﬁc applications. Therefore, more
accurate force ﬁeld parameters are required for describing these
frameworks precisely. Recently, ﬁrst-principle-based force ﬁelds
are proposed to describe interactions between atoms in adsorbate
and adsorbent. The approach combines ﬁrst-principles calculations
and GCMC simulations [268,307,308]. In the new developed force
ﬁelds, as discussed also in Section 4.1.1, the interaction energies
between the gas molecules and MOFs are obtained using ab initio or
DFT methods, which can be later ﬁtted to an appropriate potential
functions, and then force ﬁeld parameters can be obtained. In comparison with empirical force ﬁelds, ﬁrst-principle-based force ﬁelds
can precisely describe the non-bonded interactions between gas
molecules and MOFs and therefore lead to more accurate prediction
for the adsorption properties of MOFs.
GCMC simulations can be used not only to evaluate the adsorption properties of simple gas on MOFs; in the case of gas mixtures,
but also to predict the selectivity. Since the selectivity is not easily accessible from experiments, GCMC simulations show a clear
advantage to predict gas mixture separations. The separation factor
of a binary mixture is usually quantiﬁed by the adsorption selectivity S12 , which is deﬁned as: S12 = (x1 /x2 )(y2 /y1 ), xi is the mole
fraction of species i in the adsorbed phase and yi is the mole fraction
in the bulk phase, respectively.
4.1.3. Molecular dynamics
Molecular dynamics (MD) has been employed to investigate
the kinetic properties of gas molecules in various MOFs, including CO2 diffusion inside MOFs [140,286]. The kinetic properties,
together with adsorption equilibrium properties, are crucial to
evaluate the overall performance of MOFs. In characterizing the
diffusion of a single adsorbate, two most common quantities are
the self-diffusion coefﬁcient and transport diffusion coefﬁcient. The
self-diffusion coefﬁcient describes the displacement of individual
gas molecules, while the transport diffusion coefﬁcient quantiﬁes
the mass transport induced by a concentration gradient in the
adsorbed species [309,310]. Both coefﬁcients depend on the concentration of adsorbate loading, which can be remarkably different
[311,312] and only equal each other in the region of dilute pore
loading [313]. In MD simulations, MOFs are normally assumed to
be rigid. The force ﬁelds described in GCMC can usually be used in
MD simulations.
One of the challenges in understanding the diffusion behavior
of CO2 in MOFs is the little experimental information available in
regard with molecular transport. So far, MD is the main technique to

estimate the diffusion properties of CO2 in MOFs. Moreover, experimental measurement of mixture diffusion in MOFs is extremely
challenging, so the MD simulation can provide some precious information about transport properties of gas mixtures, which is very
helpful in screening and designing MOF materials for CO2 separation [314,315].
4.2. Simulation in selected MOF systems for CO2 adsorption and
separation
Despite more than 100 MOFs have been explored experimentally to date in CO2 adsorption and separation, only several typical
(or representative) MOFs were widely studied by theoretical calculations based on molecular simulations.
4.2.1. IRMOFs and Cu-BTC
In 2005, Skoulidas and Sholl ﬁrst studied CO2 diffusion in MOF-5
(IRMOF-1) [316] using equilibrium molecular dynamics (EMD). In
their simulation, the EP2 model [299] was employed for description
of CO2 ’s quadrupole moment and charges were added for all the
atoms in MOF-5 for evaluating the charge–charge interactions. The
calculation showed that CO2 adsorption is considerably stronger
compared to other gases such as Ar, CH4 , N2 and H2 . The calculated self-diffusivity and transport diffusivity have the order of
H2 > N2 ≈ CH4 ≈ Ar > CO2 at room temperature. Notably, the computed transport diffusivity of CO2 is a non-monotonic function of
pore loading.
The ﬁrst computational study of CO2 separation in MOFs
was carried out by Zhong and coworkers [317]. The separation
behaviors of gas mixtures (CO2 , CH4 , and C2 H6 ) in Cu-BTC were
investigated with GCMC simulations. Two microdomains with different electrostatic ﬁeld strengths, tetrahedron-shaped pockets
and square-shape pores, were identiﬁed. The different adsorption
properties of the microdomains lead to signiﬁcant enhancement of
gas separation. They also examined CO2 /CH4 /H2 adsorption in two
MOFs, MOF-5 and Cu-BTC [318]. Their simulation showed that gas
separation was inﬂuenced by the geometry and pore size. MOF5 possesses a simple channel structure and consequently exhibits
simple selectivity properties; whereas Cu-BTC has a more complicated channel/pocket structure, leading to complex selectivity.
More importantly, the strength of electrostatic interactions can
tremendously alter the gas separation performance, particularly for
the components with different dipoles/quadrupoles. The CO2 /CH4
and CO2 /H2 selectivities in Cu-BTC are signiﬁcantly enhanced compared to those in MOF-5, because the open metal sites of Cu-BTC
have strong electrostatic interactions with CO2 molecules. Furthermore, Zhong and coworkers [319] also conducted a computational
study of adsorption and separation of CO2 /CO and C2 H4 /CO2 mixtures in Cu-BTC. They noted that the selective adsorption can be
mostly attributed to topology structure of the side pockets. Most
gas molecules occupy the side pocket at low pressures; and more
molecules enter into the channel pores at higher pressures, primarily due to saturation of the pockets. The simulated selectivity
of equimolar CO2 /CO is 10–25 (298 K, 0–5 MPa) in Cu-BTC. Cu-BTC
also shows good selectivity of CO2 from ﬂue gases (CO2 /N2 /O2 ) mixtures, according to the simulation results by Zhong and coworkers
[320]. The high selectivity is mainly beneﬁted from the different
quadrupole moments of the gas components: CO2 possesses the
largest quadrupole in the mixtures and thus the strongest electrostatic interactions with the framework; while N2 and O2 have
smaller quadrupole moments and relatively weaker interaction.
GCMC simulations demonstrated that difference of electrostatic
interactions enhanced the separation of gases. Remarkably, they
found the gas selectivity also depended on temperature and gas
composition: the selectivity decreases sharply with increasing
temperature, and also changes signiﬁcantly with the ratio of the

J.-R. Li et al. / Coordination Chemistry Reviews 255 (2011) 1791–1823

components. These factors are important and need to be considered
in gas separation.
In 2007, Snurr and coworkers studied the adsorption sites of
light gases in MOF-5 by using Monte Carlo (MC) simulations [277].
They reported that the positions and occupations of the binding
sites can be correctly predicted when an appropriate force ﬁeld was
applied. For CO2 , the primary adsorption site is located near the
Zn4 O cluster with a planar orientation pointing towards the zinc
atom. Snurr and coworkers examined the experimental adsorption isotherms of CO2 in MOF-5 at various temperatures. Dramatic
steps of the isotherms were found with decreasing temperature
[96]. They further conducted GCMC simulations, aiming at reproducing the adsorption isotherms. Their research indicated that the
sorbate–sorbate electrostatic interactions must be included for predicting the inﬂections and steps. The unusual shape of isotherms is
subsequently ascribed to the electrostatic interaction between CO2
molecules.
Pianwanit et al. [273] investigated the optimal binding sites of
CO2 in MOF-5 by ONIOM (MP2/6-31G(d,p): HF/6-31G(d,p)) calculations. Three model clusters are respectively composed of one,
two, and three (Zn4 O)2 (OAc)10 (COO)2 C6 H4 molecule(s), and CO2
is located at linker and corner domains of the clusters with parallel
and perpendicular orientations. The study revealed the cluster size
only affects the binding energy slightly for the conﬁgurations at the
linker part but has a signiﬁcant effect on the conﬁgurations at the
corner part. To evaluate the binding energy of CO2 in MOF-5, the
model cluster needs at least a (Zn4 O)(CO)6 unit at the corner and
three (Zn4 O)(CO)6 C6 H4 fragments at the edges. The perpendicular
conﬁguration at the MOF corner was determined as the optimal
one with the lowest binding energy of −9.27 kJ/mol.
Heats of adsorption are thought to be directly related to gas
adsorption and separation in MOFs. Farrusseng et al. [127] made
a systematic study of the heats of adsorption for 7 gases in three
MOFs (IRMOF-1, IRMOF-3 and Cu-BTC). In general, the experimental and simulated heats of adsorption matched very well each
other for IRMOF-1 and IRMOF-3. For Cu-BTC, the GCMC simulations gave larger adsorption energies. A plausible explanation is
that the gas molecules were permitted to access the small pockets of Cu-BTC in the simulations but these pockets are inaccessible
for the molecules in experiments. Further simulations in which the
pockets were blocked led to much better agreement with the experimental results. The calculated adsorption heat of CO2 is 21.8 kJ/mol
in Cu-BTC, and the value decreases to 14.9 kJ/mol when the small
pockets are blocked, which is very close to the experimental value
(14.6 ± 0.5 kJ/mol, measured by TAP-2). Zhong and coworkers [321]
also studied the effect of small pockets on gas separation in Cu-BTC.
Blocking of the side pockets results in big differences in their simulated selectivity curves at low-pressure range. The pocket-blocked
Cu-BTC was shown always to exhibit lower selectivity than the
non-blocked Cu-BTC for six binary gas mixtures. Since the selectivity in the small side pockets is larger than other regions, it would
generate unrealistic results if the pockets are inaccessible for gas
molecules and not blocked in the simulations. The phenomenon
was also noticed by Krishna and van Baten [322]. They pointed
out that the experimentally inaccessible pockets of MOFs should
be blocked appropriately in GCMC simulations. A relatively simple
approach is to make a spherical space from the center of the pockets, where any molecule movement or molecule generation into
the space is prohibited in each MC step.
4.2.2. Charged MOFs
Some MOFs carry charges in their frameworks. The charges are
usually balanced by extraframework ions. Jiang [323] ﬁrst investigated the structural and adsorption properties of charged soc-MOF
using atomistic and molecular simulations. The extraframework
ions, NO3 − , encage in the capsule structures. For each capsule, four

1811

NO3 − ions are statistically located in near eight trimer building
blocks. The ionic framework shows much higher afﬁnity for CO2
because of the enhanced charge–quadrupole interactions. The predicted CO2 /H2 selectivity in soc-MOF is up to 600, among the most
efﬁcient nanoporous materials for gas separation. The presence of
trace H2 O in the mixtures considerably affects the selectivity. At low
pressures, the selectivity slightly increases because the H2 O binding
around trimers provides additional adsorption site for CO2 . At high
pressures, however, the selectivity drops due to the competitive
adsorption between CO2 and H2 O.
Another charged MOF investigated by Babarao and Jiang [287]
is rho zeolite-like MOF (rho-ZMOF), which contains an anionic
framework and extraframework Na+ ions. Analogous to soc-MOF,
rho-ZMOF also shows extraordinary CO2 separation selectivities
in CO2 /H2 , CO2 /N2 and CO2 /CH4 : for the CO2 /H2 mixture (15:85),
the predicted selectivity in rho-ZMOF is 165,000 at inﬁnite dilution and 1800 under ambient conditions; For the CO2 /CH4 mixture
(50:50), the selectivity is 3800 at inﬁnite dilution and 80 at 1 atm;
for the CO2 /N2 mixture (15:85), the selectivity reaches to 19,000
at inﬁnite dilution and drops 500 under ambient conditions. All of
these selectivities are the highest predicted to our knowledge. In
rho-ZMOF, Na+ ions are distributed around two types of binding
sites, the single eight-membered ring and the ␣-cage. Compared to
NO3 − in soc-MOF [323], Na+ ions have larger mobility in the framework and can be acted as additional binding centers. This gives
stronger charge–quadrupole interactions and accordingly, higher
adsorption selectivity. They further conducted computational studies to examine to effect of water in rho-ZMOF [324]. In general,
the presence of water signiﬁcantly inﬂuences the adsorption of
CO2 /CH4 mixtures. Their simulations showed that CO2 adsorption
drops sharply with only 0.1% of H2 O and CH4 adsorption roughly
remains same. H2 O signiﬁcantly reduced the selectivity of CO2 /CH4
mixtures by around one order of magnitude. This is because the
water molecules surrounding the Na+ ions weaken the interactions
between CO2 and Na+ .
Very recently, Babarao and Jiang [325] studied the storage and
separation of CO2 in a highly porous ionic rht-MOF using molecular simulations. The MOF has a cationic framework and the charges
are balanced by NO3 − ions, which show low mobility and reside
near the small windows connecting the tetrahedral and cuboctahedral cages. The MOF has three different types of cages and is
suitable for gas storage. The calculations indicated the selectivity
of CO2 /H2 in rht-MOF is not as high as rho-ZMOF and soc-MOF. This
can be attributed to the highly porous structure and relatively low
charge density of rht-MOF. Similar to rho-ZMOF, the selectivity of
CO2 /H2 in substantially reduces in rht-MOF in the presence of H2 O,
as the interactions between CO2 and NO3 − is shielded by the water
molecules around the NO3 − ions.
Introducing ions into MOF systems generally leads to enhanced
adsorption and selectivity for CO2 . The structure and separation
properties of Li+ exchanged MOFs (Li+ -MOFs) were examined
by Babarao and Jiang [325]. The structures of the hydrated and
dehydrated Li+ -MOFs were optimized from DFT calculations. The
preferential adsorption sites are near the cations and metal clusters. The predicted selectivity of CO2 over H2 and N2 is 550 and 60
at room temperature and 1 atm. Li+ -MOFs possess higher selectivity
than non-ionic MOFs and most other porous materials. According
to GCMC simulations, the high selectivity is originated from the
charges of cations and frameworks. The hydrated Li+ -MOFs displays slightly less adsorption and selectivity due to the reduced
free volume.
Xu and Zhong [326] modiﬁed MOF-5 by introducing O–Li groups
into the organic linkers and tested the separation selectivity of
CO2 /CH4 for 3 Li-modiﬁed MOFs. The results from GCMC simulations showed signiﬁcant changes of the framework charges,
the isosteric heats of adsorption and the preferential adsorption

1812

J.-R. Li et al. / Coordination Chemistry Reviews 255 (2011) 1791–1823

sites in the modiﬁed MOFs. These changes result in huge enhancement of the CO2 selectivity from the gas mixtures. For example,
the selectivity reaches as high as 190 at a pressure of 0.1 MPa
(298 K, CO2 :CH4 = 1:9). Their research conﬁrmed that incorporation of ionic or ionic-like groups into MOF systems is an effective
approach to improve the selectivity of gas mixtures.
4.2.3. ZIFs
Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) generally have high thermal and moister stability compared to other types of MOFs. Zhong
and coworkers [327] studied the adsorption and diffusion behaviors of CO2 in two typical ZIFs, ZIF-68 and ZIF-69 using combined
GCMC and MD techniques. CO2 molecules preferentially adsorb in
the small pores encompassed by the nIM (nitroimidazole) linkers.
With the increasing pressure, the molecules can also be adsorbed
in the corners formed by the phenyl ring in the large pores and
further occupy the pores. For ZIF-69, the chlorine atoms in cbIM
linkers play an important role in the enhancement of CO2 binding
energy. Similar to many other MOF systems, the contribution of
framework charges cannot be ignored at low pressures. Their MD
calculations indicated that the diffusion of CO2 in ZIF-69 is slower
than ZIF-68 due to the pore size and steric hindrance. Moreover, the
study suggested a slower CO2 diffusion in ZIFs than that in other
MOFs.
Johnson and coworkers [281] also reported their computational
results of adsorption and diffusion of CO2 , H2 , N2 and CH4 in
ZIF-68 and ZIF-70. They found the X-ray diffraction structure of
ZIF-70 had a wrong ratio of IM to nIM and thus failed to predict experimental adsorption isotherms for N2 . The error was
corrected after ratio adjustment and DFT geometry optimization.
The simulated N2 adsorption data was in good agreement with
experimental results when taking framework charges into account.
However, incorporation of charges failed to generate reliable CO2
isotherms at low pressures for both ZIF-68 and ZIF-70. The discrepancy has not been understood, though it perhaps arises from
an unrealistic framework-CO2 attraction in the models. Notably,
the results are not consistent with previous computational studies
[327]. They claimed that Liu and coworkers model underestimated
adsorbent–adsorbent attractions and the good agreement between
experiments and the simulations by Liu and coworkers may be
caused by a fortuitous cancellation of errors. Furthermore, the
inclusion/exclusion of charges signiﬁcantly inﬂuences the calculated diffusivities, particularly, at low loading.
Recently, Nieto-Draghi and coworkers [328] investigated the
adsorption of CH4 , N2 , and CO2 on three ZIFs, ZIF-8 and ZIF-76
and ZIF-69. Their GCMC simulations showed that standard force
ﬁelds were not reliable and failed to reproduce experimental data.
A modiﬁed force ﬁeld optimized by experimental data was adopted
to examine the adsorption behavior. The simulated adsorption
isotherms predicted the CO2 uptake order (ZIF-69 < ZIF-8 < ZIF-76)
at high pressures, which is partially veriﬁed by experiments. The
simulations also indicated preferential adsorption sites of ZIF-8,
located at the organic linkers. Furthermore, the charge–quadrupole
contribution prevails in the interactions between the metal atoms
and CO2 ; whereas the vdW contribution is only <10% in the overall binding energy. According to the calculated Henry constant
and isosteric heats of adsorption, vdW interactions dominate the
adsorption of CH4 and N2 , while vdW and electrostatic interactions
co-govern the adsorption of CO2 in the ZIFs. Remarkably, the study
indicated ZIFs possess some properties similar to zeolites. Woo and
coworkers [329] carried out GCMC and MD studies of CO and CO2
adsorption in ZIF-68 and ZIF-69. The GCMC simulation was performed at low pressures (0–1 atm) at 273 K. In the low-pressure
range, the uptake of gas molecules is not determined by the geometric structure, but controlled by the properties of binding sites in
the framework. The aromatic functional groups were identiﬁed as

the adsorption sites. CO/CO2 was observed in both pores and channels in the ZIFs. In particular, CO2 molecules are rarely distributed
in the central region of the pores because of the loss of entropy in
the conﬁned space at low pressures. Two groups of binding sites,
respectively lying in the equatorial and polar region of the pores,
were found in the pores of the ZIFs. In addition, the channel structures can also hold 2–6 gas molecules. MD simulations revealed
CO/CO2 molecules rarely inter-diffuse between pores and channels
in the ZIFs. The diffusion rates of CO/CO2 are not equal in the pores
and channels due to the different aperture sizes.
4.2.4. MIL-53 series
MIL-53 has already triggered a lot of interest due to its unusual
microscopic adsorption behavior. Two interchanging conﬁgurations of MIL-53(Al) structure upon CO2 adsorption, named the large
pore (MIL-53lp(Al)) and narrow pore (MIL-53np(Al)) forms, were
identiﬁed [104]. The two forms share the same chemical composition but differ in the pore width. Maurin and coworkers calculated
the Mulliken and electrostatic potential (ESP) charges using DFT for
GCMC simulations [297]. The predicted enthalpies of adsorption
at low CO2 coverage match the experimental values very well for
both forms. The results suggested that a structural transition occurs
during the CO2 adsorption process. Their GCMC simulation further
provided evidence for the breathing effect (structural transition
upon CO2 adsorption) [216]: the simulated isotherms for each MIL53(Al) form are in good agreement with the corresponding region of
the experimental isotherm. Furthermore, the calculated enthalpies
of adsorption for MIL-53np(Al) and MIL-53lp(Al) correspond to the
experimental data at low pressures (<6 bar) and at high pressures,
respectively. The structural analysis showed that the breathing
effect may be induced by the quadrupole moment of CO2 . The
breathing mechanism can only be induced by molecules with big
dipole or quadrupole moments such as CO2 and H2 O. Non-polar
molecules such as CH4 have no such effect [330].
To further understand the breathing effect in MIL-53, Maurin
and coworkers [331] compared adsorption of CO2 in MIL-53(Al)
and MIL-47(V). The breathing was found in MIL-53(Al) but not in
MIL-47(V). They proposed a mechanism to describe the structural
transition between the large pore (NP) and narrow pore (LP) forms:
the 2 -OH groups in MIL-53(Al) are the preferential CO2 adsorption
sites, and the adsorption geometries are controlled by the interactions between CO2 and the 2 -OH groups. Before the adsorption
sites are not fully occupied, the NP form prevails due to the strong
double interaction of CO2 and two 2 -OH groups. When the adsorption sites are fully occupied with the increasing CO2 loading, the
geometry is not energetically favorable and thus switches to LP, of
which the larger free volume counterbalances the packing effect.
Maurin and coworkers [100] examined the plausible CO2 adsorption sites in MIL-53(Al or Cr) and MIL-47(V) using DFT and further
revealed the key role of the 2 -OH group of MIL-53 in the adsorption process. In MIL-47(V), there are no preferential adsorption sites
like 2 -OH, and therefore the breathing mechanism is not applicable. Maurin and coworkers [99] conducted MD simulations to
study CO2 -induced structural transition of MIL-53 aiming to capture the structural switching directly. They successfully reproduced
the breathing in the process of CO2 adsorption for MIL-53(Cr) using
a bonded force ﬁeld. Furthermore, their study on the transport diffusivity of CO2 in MIL-53(Cr) showed that the diffusion follows a
1D mechanism (along the channel) and the diffusivity of LP is two
orders of magnitude larger than that in NP [139].
The adsorption and separation of CO2 /CH4 in the highly ﬂexible
MIL-53(Cr) MOF was investigated using various experimental and
computational techniques [136]. The breathing of MIL-53(Cr) was
only observed for CO2 -rich and equimolar mixtures. CH4 is unable
to adsorb in the narrow pore form. This can lead to an extremely
high CO2 /CH4 selectivity if the narrow-pore form dominates. How-

J.-R. Li et al. / Coordination Chemistry Reviews 255 (2011) 1791–1823

ever, this was not conﬁrmed by experiments, possibly due to the
high energy barrier of LP/NP transition. The selectivity drops when
the pressure increases. Notably, since the narrow form and the large
form of MIL-53(Cr) can coexist in a large range of pressure and
CO2 /CH4 composition, the selectivity is very difﬁcult to predict.
Coudert et al. [110] proposed an osmotic framework adsorbed
solution theory (OFAST) to predict the structural transformation
upon adsorption of gas mixture in ﬂexible MOFs. The theory was
used to predict the adsorption of CO2 /CH4 in MIL-53(Al) and led to
some insights into the structural transition: (1) MIL-53NP(Al)/MIL53LP(Al) mixtures are only formed above the critical composition
(CO2 :CH4 = 0.12:0.88); (2) breathing only occurs below ∼7.8 bar at
304 K; (3) the transition from narrow pore from to large pore form
varies non-monotonically with the mixture composition. Ghouﬁ
and Maurin [332] also developed a hybrid osmotic Monte Carlo
(HOMC) approach integrating both MD and GCMC techniques. The
structural transitions of MIL-53(Cr) upon CO2 adsorption were simulated using the HOMC approach. The microscopic transition from
MIL-53LP (Cr) to MIL-53NP (Cr) was captured at low pressures;
whereas the second transition from MIL-53NP (Cr) to MIL-53LP
(Cr) was absent at high pressures. Moreover, it was found that a
“phase mixture” model must be combined with the approach for
producing the experimental adsorption isotherms.
4.2.5. Other MOFs
A carborane-based MOF, [Zn3 (OH)(p-cdc)2.5 (DEF)4 ]n was synthesized by Snurr and coworkers [202]. This was the ﬁrst MOF
built based on boron-rich components. The coordinated solvent
molecules in the MOF can be removed and this leads to unsaturated metal sites, which may exhibit enhanced selectivity for
the quadrupolar CO2 /non-quadrupolar CH4 mixtures. Snurr and
coworkers [166] examined the separation of CO2 /CH4 mixtures in
the MOF by GCMC techniques and veriﬁed the hypothesis. The MOF
with open metal sites shows considerably larger selectivity and
adsorption capacities than the one without open sites. The Ideal
Adsorbed Solution Theory (IAST) calculations predicted a superior
CO2 /CH4 selectivity of the MOF. Zn2 (2,6-ndc)2 (dpni) is a mixedligand MOF synthesized by Hupp and coworkers [172] with two
different methods. According to the IAST calculations based on
the experimental single-component isotherms, the evacuated sample from microwave-assistant methods (1-M ) shows much higher
CO2 /CH4 selectivity than the one from conventional method (1-C ).
However, as the IAST analysis may fail at high pressures, GCMC simulations were used to verify the reliability of the IAST model. The
simulated isotherms fully agreed with the IAST results. The GCMC
calculations further conﬁrmed that 1-M is a promising material for
CO2 /CH4 separation.
Recently, a combined experimental and computational study on
the adsorption of CO, N2 and CO2 on a new MOF, Mg-MOF-74,
was conducted by Palomino and coworkers [282]. The geometry and adsorption enthalpy ( H0 ) were calculated using periodic
DFT-D method [279], in which the long-distance dispersion interactions are taken into account with an empirical scheme. The results
showed that CO and N2 form roughly linear 1:1 complexes with
Mg2+ while CO2 forms an angular complex. Remarkably, dispersion
interactions contribute ∼1/2 gas-framework interaction energies in
all the adsorption complexes and should be included in the calculations. The calculated H0 indicated that CO2 has the strongest
adsorption on Mg-MOF-74 among the 3 gases, in good agreement
with the experimental values. The difference of H0 is 18 kJ/mol
for CO2 /CO and 26 kJ/mol for CO2 /N2 , which is big enough for the
corresponding gas separation.
The presence of water substantially inﬂuences the adsorption and selectivity of gas mixtures in most MOFs. Chen
et al. studied a highly hydrophobic MOF, Zn(bdc)(ted)0.5
(ted = triethylenediamine) [333], H2 O adsorption is not applicable

1813

due to the hydrophobic structure of the pores. In the presence of
water, the adsorption and selectivity of CO2 /CH4 mixtures remain
essentially unchanged.
4.3. Exploring and optimizing performances of CO2 storage,
selectivity adsorption, and separation in MOFs
Compared with experiments, molecular simulations are much
easier to be used to explore some MOF systems for their optimized performances, such as in CO2 uptake, selective adsorption,
and separation. Besides real MOFs, some conceptually modiﬁed
and hypothetical MOFs have also been studied by the molecular
simulations in this topic.
4.3.1. CO2 storage in MOFs
MOFs are promising materials for gas storage owing to their
porous structures. Zhong and coworkers systematically investigated nine typical MOFs with various pore sizes, topologies, organic
linkers and electrostatic properties using molecular simulations
[286]. The results indicated that a suitable pore size for CO2 stor˚ CO2 uptake is governed by the strength of
age is around 10–20 A.
the CO2 –MOF interactions at low pressures. Other factors, such as
accessible surface area and free volume, are also crucial to CO2
adsorption capacity at high pressures. The electrostatic interactions between CO2 and MOFs contribute up to 30% of the total
adsorption capacity at low pressures, however, the contribution
decreases rapidly with the increase of pressure and the value
drops to a few percent at high pressures. In general, MOFs have
higher capacities for CO2 storage and comparable self-diffusivity
in comparison to most zeolites and carbon materials. To further
understand the inﬂuence of framework charges on CO2 uptake,
Zhong and coworkers [334] examined 20 different MOFs. The contribution of framework charges was estimated by switching on and
switching off the electrostatic interactions between MOFs and CO2
in their GCMC simulations. The results are consistent with their
previous work [286]: at low pressures, CO2 molecules preferentially adsorb around the polar centers in the framework and the
electrostatic contribution is therefore large. The adsorption sites
are saturated at high pressures and most CO2 molecules are located
far from the charge centers. The effect is more pronounced in big
pores. Consequently, the electrostatic interaction decreases and
can be neglected in many cases. Babarao and Jiang [302] systematically evaluated the performance of various MOFs using Gibbs
ensemble Monte Carlo (GEMC) (Fig. 19). Their work revealed that
MOFs exhibit remarkably higher adsorption capacity than zeolites
and single-wall nanotubes. The capacity is primarily determined by
the strength of CO2 adsorption at low pressures, while it is mainly
dependent on the free volume and accessible surface area at high
pressures.
4.3.2. CO2 selective adsorption and adsorptive separation in MOFs
Jiang and coworkers [335] computationally investigated the
adsorptive separation of CO2 /CH4 in seven different MOFs, including IRMOF-5, metal exposed Cu-BTC, PCN-6 and PCN-6, catenated
IRMOF-13 and non-catenated IRMOF-14, and charged soc-MOF.
Catenation leads to constricted small pores and additional adsorption sites in IRMOF-13 and PCN-6, and accordingly, adsorption
enhancement at low pressures compared to non-catenated IRMOF14 and PCN-6 ; whereas the trend is reversed at high pressures.
Although the adsorption behaviors change with different pressures, catenated MOFs show higher CO2 /CH4 selectivity than their
non-catenated counterparts because the catenation enhances the
interaction with CO2 . The uncoordinated open metal sites, small
pockets and narrow pores can enhance electrostatic interactions
and therefore increase the selectivity. In particular, the presence
of extraframework ions in charged soc-MOF can greatly boost the

strength of interactions with adsorbates and results in the highest
CO2 /CH4 selectivity.
Zhong and coworkers [336] compared CO2 /H2 adsorption of
three pairs of MOFs, including three catenated MOFs (IRMOFs-9, 11, and -13) and their non-catenated counterparts (IRMOFs-10, -12,
and -14). The simulation results showed that the catenated IRMOFs
have much higher CO2 /H2 selectivity than the non-catenated ones.
The enhanced CO2 selectivity of catenated IRMOFs can be mainly
attributed to the electrostatic interactions. The strength of interactions is correlated to the pore size. The electrostatic interactions
between CO2 and MOFs dominate the selectivity at low pressures
and the electrostatic interactions of CO2 –CO2 become evident and
eventually dominant at high pressures. Zhong and coworkers also
evaluated the performance of COFs and MOFs for CH4 /CO2 /H2 mixtures [337] and found similar adsorption selectivities of COFs and
MOFs.
Liu and Smit compared the separation and storage efﬁciency
of CO2 /N2 mixture in three zeolites and seven MOFs using GCMC
simulations [338]. Not surprisingly, CO2 adsorption is more preferable for all the materials. Although the gas storage capacity of all
the MOFs is substantially higher than that of zeolites at higher
pressures, comparable separation selectivity of the two classes of
materials was obtained. Cu-BTC possesses the best performance
and MOFs with large pores display relatively low selectivity. In
the simulation, switching off the electrostatic interactions between
gases and adsorbents resulted in lower selectivity, indicating the
framework charges play a more signiﬁcant role for CO2 adsorption
than for N2 adsorption. Accordingly, the difference in quadrupole of
gas molecules must be considered in order to achieve high separation selectivity. Moreover, pore size was found an important factor
for separation efﬁciency. The pore size of 5.0–10.0 A˚ is suitable for
CO2 /N2 separation.
Snurr and coworkers [201] compared the performance of 14
MOFs for CO2 capture at low pressures using a combined experimental and computational approach. Their study aimed to develop
a model for fast screening of MOFs for gas capture, leading to substantial savings in the experimental time and cost. CO2 uptake
correlates with the heat of adsorption at low pressures. The proposed model gave some successful predictions. For instance, MOFs
with a high density of open metal sites has the highest efﬁciency
for CO2 uptake. It is a big challenge to identify MOFs with useful properties for targeted applications due to the large numbers
of MOF structures. Recently, Sholl and coworkers [315] proposed
an efﬁcient method to characterize the features which control gas
diffusion in the MOFs. The method is based on the information
from X-ray crystal structures and able to rapidly predict the Henry’s
constant for adsorption and diffusion activation energy for simple

gases. The approach was used to screen more than 500 MOFs and
was demonstrated an effective one in identifying suitable materials for kinetic separation of adsorbates. However, there are some
limits which need to be overcome in the method: (1) the method
is unable to examine non-spherical molecules; (2) the calculated
Henry’s constant for adsorption and diffusion activation energy are
only applicable for non-polar adsorbates. (3) The method may lead
to big deviations at high pressures.
4.3.3. Modeling MOF membranes for CO2 separation
Sholl et al. [339] carried out computational studies to evaluate
the performance of MOF membranes for gas mixture separation.
They ﬁrst tested the performance of MOF-5 membranes for the
separation of CO2 /CH4 mixtures. Although their single-component
results predicted strong selectivities for CH4 in the mixtures, the
mixture adsorption and diffusion showed that MOF-5 membranes
only possess weak selectivity for CO2 . Their results revealed that
the performance of MOF membranes cannot be correctly predicted
only using the properties of single-component gases, and mixture
effects are crucial in determining the membrane properties. Keskin
and Sholl [340] further predicted the selectivities of MOF-5 membranes for more binary gas mixtures such as CO2 /H2 , CO2 /N2 , and
N2 /CH4 (Fig. 20). The studies led to the same conclusion. They
developed a method to predict mixture adsorption and diffusion
based on the mixing theories using the results of single-component
adsorption and transport simulation. The accuracy of the approach
was assessed and the results are reliable. Sholl and coworkers [314]
used the method to predict the performance of Cu-BTC membranes
for separation of CO2 /H2 , CO2 /CH4 and H2 /CH4 . It was found that
Cu-BTC membranes possess much high selectivities for the binary
gas mixtures than MOF-5 membranes; i.e. 20:1 for CO2 /H2 . Consequently, the structure of a MOF governs the performance of a
MOF-based membrane. Moreover, although the performance is codetermined by the diffusion selectivity and adsorption selectivity
for gas mixtures, the selectivity of adsorption dominates the overall
performance of the MOF membranes.
Sholl and coworkers [341] examined a microporous MOF
membrane, Cu(hﬁpbb)(H2 hﬁpbb)0.5 using MD, GCMC and DFT
calculations. Their investigations focused on the adsorption and
diffusion of CO2 and CH4 in the MOF. Not surprisingly, CO2 is
much more strongly adsorbed than CH4 in the MOF. The MD simulations showed that CO2 diffusion is much more rapid and the
calculated diffusivity of CO2 is orders of magnitude larger than that
of CH4 , indicating that an effective kinetic separation is applicable.
In addition, DFT calculations also showed the diffusion activation
energy for CO2 (16 kJ/mol) is much smaller than for CH4 (45 kJ/mol).
According these results, they predicted that the CO2 selectivity of

Fig. 20. Predicted (a) ideal and (b) mixture permeation selectivities for a 10 ␮m thick MOF-5 membrane. The transmembrane pressure drop is 80% of feed pressure. Mixture

the MOF membrane is ∼104 –105 , higher than any other polymeric
membranes for CO2 /CH4 separation.
4.3.4. Ligand effect for CO2 adsorption
Organic linkers in many MOFs play an important role in gas
adsorption. Modiﬁcation the structures of the linker part can
effectively enhance the adsorption. Torrisi et al. [275,276] examined the intermolecular interactions between CO2 and a series
of functionalized aromatic molecules using DFT at PW91/DNP
level. Their research indicated that the strength of CO2 -atomatic
ring interactions can be tuned by introducing some functional
groups to the ring structure. Halogen substituents exhibit a relatively strong destabilization effect, whereas methyl groups are
able to slightly improve the stability, primarily due to the strengthened -quadrupole interaction arising from the inductive effect.
Other polar groups, such as –NH2 , –SO3 H, and –COOH improve
the CO2 afﬁnity signiﬁcantly, increasing the binding energy of
∼5–11 kJ/mol. On the basis of the study, Torrisi et al. [342] further proposed a modiﬁed MOF-53LP(Al) structure, in which four
functional groups (–OH, –COOH, –NH2 , and –CH3 ) were introduced to the benzene diacarboxyle (BDC) ligands. Periodic DFT,
DFT on model complexes, and GCMC calculations unanimously
indicated the enhancement of CO2 binding energy with the ligand substitution. Among the substituents, (OH)2 -MIL-53(LP) and
(COOH)2 -MIL-53(LP) were found the best candidates for CO2 capture and CO2 /CH4 selectivity. Zhong and coworkers [343] decorated
the aromatic ring of the organic linker with four different functional
groups (–OH, –F, –NH2 , and –CH3 ) in MOF-5. They found that introducing electron-donating groups into the organic linkers largely
improves the selectivity of CO2 /CH4 mixtures due to the strengthened electrostatic ﬁeld distributions in the pores. The incorporation
of electron-withdrawing groups, however, only has slight inﬂuence
on the selectivity.
MIL-101 is known as one of the most porous materials to date.
Jiang and coworkers [333] examined the adsorption of CO2 and
CH4 in MOF-101 using DFT and GCMC, aiming to understand the
role of terminal water molecules coordinated to metal sites. At
low pressures, the hydrated MIL-101 exhibits enhanced adsorption for CO2 compared to the dehydrated counterpart, as the water
molecules act as additional adsorption sites, whereas the reverse
was observed at high pressures because the water molecules
reduce the total free volume. Likewise, the adsorption selectivity of CO2 /CH4 is slightly higher in hydrated MIL-101. Removal
of coordinated solvent molecules from metal sites usually boost
the selectivity for some MOFs [166]; however, the opposite effect

also can be present in some cases. Snurr and coworkers [124]
predicted that water bound to open-metal sites of Cu-BTC substantially improved the adsorption capacities and CO2 selectivity
over CH4 and N2 . GCMC simulations showed a 4–11% increase
of the non-Coulombic interaction and a ∼210–400% increase of
the Coulombic interaction with water molecules coordinated to
the open Cu sites in Cu-BTC. Consequently, the enhancement of
CO2 adsorption was mostly ascribed to the Coulombic interactions between water and CO2 . This was veriﬁed by experimental
adsorption measurements: CO2 uptake increases by 71% in the
4 wt% hydrated Cu-BTC at 0.1 bar and by 45% at 1 bar. Following
the idea, they found that CO2 /N2 selectivity can also be improved
by replacing coordinated solvent molecules with highly polar ligands in MOF systems, in a new synthesized 3D non-catenated
Zn-paddlewheel MOF, Zn(bttb)(dmf)2 [159]. A polar group, CF3 py, was employed to replace DMF molecules coordinated with the
Zn(II)2 sites. Enhanced selectivities of CO2 /N2 and CO2 /CH4 selectivity with the CF3 -py coordinated MOF arising from the strong
dipole–quadrupole interactions were predicted by their IAST calculations.
4.3.5. Clustering effect
Guest molecules usually present in a metastable state in micropores due to the reduced effect of capillary condensation, leading
to a possible clustering of the molecules. Krishna and van Baten
[344] investigated the cluster formation upon CO2 adsorption at
subcritical temperatures in several MOFs and zeolites. They found
clustering of CO2 occurs when the fraction vacancy 1/ I > 1 and
the clustering is enhanced at low temperature. Furthermore, MOFs
with larger pores, such as IRMOF-1 and Cu-BTC, are more favorable
for clustering. A more recent study showed that the adsorption
and diffusion properties in MOFs are strongly affected by molecular clustering [345]: the Fick diffusivity can be lower than self
diffusivity in the conditions of severe clustering and 1/ I 1. The
adsorption selectivity in mixtures is signiﬁcantly enhanced for the
component with a higher degree of clustering. Moreover, the diffusion selectivity is also enhanced by increased degree of clustering.
Therefore, the improvement of permeation selectivity of mixtures
in membrane separation can be reached at an optimum temperature.
4.4. New computational methodologies for MOFs
Although some existing methods developed originally based on
other porous materials for gas adsorption and separation, such

as zeolites, can be used in MOFs, due to the special composition
and pore properties of MOFs, new or modiﬁed simulation (theory)
methods should be developed.
Framework charges are essential for an accurate description
of adsorption in molecular simulations. They are usually obtained
from ab initio/DFT calculations, which is very time-consuming. Xu
and Zhong [326] proposed an empirical approach for framework
charge estimation. Their method, called “connectivity-based atom
contribution” (CBAC), is built on an assumption that the atomic
charge of an atom in a MOF is fully determined by its bonding
environment. Consequently, any atoms with the same bonding
connection have identical charges. 35 most extensively used atom
connection types were extracted from a set of 30 MOFs. Simulated
CO2 adsorption isotherms in 13 additional MOFs using both QM and
CBAC charges were compared: the results are in excellent agreement with each other. The approach can successfully reproduce
experimental isotherms and greatly saves computational time for
large-scale screening of MOFs.
Like MIL-53, many MOFs exhibit unusual ﬂexibility. Snurr and
coworkers [346] developed a new computational method to efﬁciently calculate the unit cell shape and size for the ﬂexible
structures loaded with adsorbates. The method, based on the
model-following technique for rigid bodies, is suitable to treat rigid
molecules in a ﬂexible system. Two sample studies showed that the
approach can successfully minimize the structure of IRMOF-1 at 0 K
and predict the structure change of MIL-53 in the presence of water.
The method is expected to be very useful to evaluate gas adsorption
in ﬂexible materials.
Jiang and coworkers [347] used a classical molecular “density
functional theory” for the adsorption of gas mixtures. In the classical DFT, weighted density approximations with different weighting
functions are applied to the attractive and repulsive parts of
excess free energy, and the excess free energy of the uniform ﬂuid
can be derived from the equations of state for hard-sphere and
Lennard–Jones mixtures. Variations of this theory have been widely
employed in the analysis of adsorption for ﬂuids conﬁned in simple geometries [348]. The theory was employed to examine the
adsorption of CO2 /CH4 and CO2 /N2 mixtures in two MOFs, ZIF-8
and Zn2 (bdc)2 (ted). Good agreement between the DFT estimated
adsorption and selectivity and the molecular simulation results
veriﬁed the validity of the theory.
5. Strategies for enhancing the CO2 separation ability of
MOFs
In terms of inherent characteristics in design, synthesis, structure, and porous properties of MOFs, as well as the properties of
gases involved in CO2 separation several strategies can be deduced

or proposed to increase the separation ability of CO2 in MOFs.
The strategies for separation are also intimately connected to the
methods and processes, which implies that adsorptive separation
and membrane-based separation have different emphases when
considering the materials that will be used. For adsorptive separation, high CO2 uptake capacity and selectivity from other gases are
equally important for an adsorbent material; but, for membranebased separation, the high penetrability and selectivity are primary
concerns. There are, however, some common themes that must be
considered in all aspects. Considering that practical application is
the ultimate goal of any of these projects, it is imperative that (1)
efﬁcacious separation can be done at room temperature or higher
and at low pressure; (2) stability of the materials can survive the
harsh real-world conditions; and (3) low cost in the material preparation and regeneration is considered.

5.1. Fixing pore size and shape in MOFs
The pore size and shape is always the ﬁrst consideration in
selecting a porous material for special separation. The molecular
sieve effect has been widely used in zeolites and other porous materials for gas separation. Alternately, the performance of a porous
material in kinetic separation is also directly related to the pore
size and shape of adsorbent, not only in adsorptive separation but
also in membrane-based separation. A balance must also be struck
between small enough to separate the desired gas mixture and too
small as to trap the molecules and stop gas ﬂow all together. MOFs,
due to their easily controllable synthesis and modiﬁcation, have
great potential and advantages compared to traditional zeolites and
other inorganic molecular sieves in controlling pore size and shape
for the appointed separation.
A prominent example in the control of pore size is the exploration of isoreticular ZIFs for their CO2 selective capture properties
reported by Yaghi and coworkers (Fig. 21) [157]. In this work, the
authors described a new construction method for achieving precisely controlled metrics and functionality in an isoreticular series
of eight ZIFs with the desirable GME topology. Within this series
of ZIFs, the pore diameter was varied incrementally from 7.1 to
˚ The results showed that these ZIFs have pore size and sur15.9 A.
face functionality dependent selectivity for CO2 capture from its
binary mixtures with CH4 and N2 .
Cation exchange has also been adopted to tune the pore size
in bio-MOF-1 reported by Rosi and coworkers [122], as mentioned
above. Experimental results showed that the pore size of bio-MOF1 can be modiﬁed post-synthetically via straightforward cationexchange and that such modiﬁcations can be used to systematically
tune the CO2 adsorption capacity of the materials.

Controlling interpenetration of the framework in MOFs
is another strategy for tuning the pore size. One example,
Cu(fma)(bpee)0.5 , reported by Chen et al. [175] was rationally designed from a primitive cubic net and its pores
are tuned by double framework interpenetration. With pore
˚ which are interconnected by pore
cavities of about 3.6 A,
˚ this MOF presented highly selecwindows of 2.0 A˚ × 3.2 A,
tive sorption behaviors of CO2 over N2 . Similar interpenetrated MOFs with CO2 selective adsorption ability include
Zn(abdc)(bpee)0.5 [174] and Ni(cyclam)2 (mtb) (cyclam = 1,4,8,11tetraazacyclotetradecane, mtb = methanetetrabenzoate) [349]. As
discussed above, MOF-508b with an interpenetrated structure and
one-dimensional micropores of 4.0 A˚ × 4.0 A˚ showed preferential
adsorption of CO2 over N2 and CH4 , partly due to the pore size
[165].
5.2. Functionalizing the pore surface of MOFs
As mentioned above, CO2 is a highly quadrupolar gas, whereas
competitive sorbates in commonly concerned CO2 capture separation, including N2 , CH4 , and H2 are non-polar or weakly polar.
This means that there are profound differences in the interaction between these gas molecules and the pore surface of porous
material, which can be taken advantage of when modifying the
surface properties of MOFs to greatly enhance the adsorption
and separation ability. The surface properties of MOFs can be
tuned not only by pre-design of ligands, metal-containing nodes,
and MOF construction but also by post-modiﬁcation of existing
MOFs.
Open active metal sites located on the pore walls of a
MOF provide an approach for the enhanced separation of
(quadru)polar/non-polar gas pairs, such as CO2 /CH4 . These active
adsorption centers are usually created by post treatment of MOFs,
because they are always occupied by a coordinated species, such
as a solvent molecule, during the synthesis. The open metal sites
in paddlewheel Cu2 (COO)4 units of many MOFs are among the
most extensively studied. MOFs, such as HKUST-1 have demonstrated preferential adsorption of CO2 over CH4 and N2 [156]. The
adsorption mechanism has been described as coordination of the
CO2 molecule to the Cu center in an end-on fashion [130]. This
preferred adsorption directly on an open metal site has also been
conﬁrmed in MIL-100 and MIL-101 [135], and the series of isostructural frameworks, M2 (dhtp) (CPO-27 or MOF-74, M = Ni, Co, Zn, Mg,
and Mn) [155]. To back up these ﬁndings and calculate the energies involved, molecular simulation on related systems have also
demonstrated that open metal sites in MOFs are very useful in CO2
selective adsorption and separation [92].

The introduction of functional groups with a high afﬁnity for
CO2 into pores of MOFs has been employed as another strategy
to enhance the adsorption capacity and selectivity of CO2 adsorption. Hupp and coworkers grafted the highly polar py-CF3 groups
onto a MOF containing open metal sites to get Zn2 (bttb)(CF3 -py)2
[159]. This functionalization has led to a remarkable enhancement in the CO2 uptake compared with N2 at low pressure.
In contrast to most of the reported frameworks where the
unsaturated metal centers act as Lewis acid sites, Lewis base functionalization can also enhance CO2 adsorption due to acid–base
interactions between CO2 (acid) and the basic active centers.
This has been realized in a sulfone-functionalized MOF, UoC-1
which exhibited selective CO2 adsorption over CH4 , N2 , and H2
[162]. Considering the afﬁnity of amines towards CO2 , amine functionalized ligands have been combined into several MOFs for
enhancing the adsorption and selectivity of CO2 . As discussed
above, amino-MIL-53(Al) presented enhanced CO2 uptake relative to CH4 compared with the parent MIL-53(Al) [98]. Similar
enhancements have been observed in Ni2 (NH2 -bdc)2 (dabco) relative to their non-functionalized analogues [350]. Furthermore,
Long and coworkers [126] have demonstrated that alkylaminefunctionalization of frameworks can enhance the selectivity for
CO2 adsorption, especially at the low pressures. In their report,
the exposed metal sites in HCu[(Cu4 Cl)3 (BTTri)8 ] (Cu-BTTri) were
coordinated by ethylenediamine (en) by post-synthetically treating to get the en-functionalized MOF as shown in Fig. 22. Despite
reduction in surface area compared with the parent framework,
the en-functionalized MOF presented a higher CO2 uptake at low
pressures compared with its parent framework, as well as the
highest initial heat of adsorption (90 kJ/mol) for any MOF. Similarly, acylamide groups have also been conﬁrmed to be effective
in enhancing CO2 binding afﬁnity, as realized in MOF Cu3 (tpbtm),
thereby increasing the adsorption selectivity for CO2 over N2
[198].
Similar to most zeolites, MOFs with framework charge have
been conﬁrmed as having enhanced CO2 adsorption and selectivity. Babarao and Jiang [287] reported a molecular simulation study
for the separation of gas mixture of CO2 /H2 , CO2 /CH4 , and CO2 /N2
in a zeolite-like metal-organic framework (rho-ZMOF), which is
composed of an open anionic framework and charge-balanced by
extra-framework Na+ ions. The simulation results revealed that
CO2 is adsorbed predominantly over other gases because of its
strong electrostatic interactions with the charged framework and
the presence of Na+ ions acting as additional adsorption sites. At
ambient temperature and pressure, the CO2 selectivity is 1800 for
the CO2 /H2 , 80 for the CO2 /CH4 , and 500 for the CO2 /N2 mixture.
Compared with other MOFs and porous materials, this ionic MOF

1818

presents unprecedentedly high selective adsorption for CO2 over
other gases.
In addition, the insertion of metal salts within the pores of MOFs
has been demonstrated to be a useful approach in enhancing CO2
binding. Recently, Long and coworkers [197] have showed that the
selectivity factor for binding CO2 over N2 under typical ﬂue gas
conditions increase from 2.8 in Al(OH)(bpydc) (MOF-253) to 12 in
Al(OH)(bpydc)·0.97Cu(BF4 )2 . The latter MOF material was obtained
by the post-synthetic insertion of Cu(BF4 )2 into the former. The
insertion of metal salts is hypothesized to create electric dipoles
on the surface of the MOF, which can give strong interaction with
CO2 . Indeed, the heat of adsorption for CO2 increases from 23 to
30 kJ/mol upon the insertion of Cu(BF4 )2 into Al(OH)(bpydc).
5.3. Taking advantage of the ﬂexibility of MOFs
Compared to rigid MOFs, ﬂexible or stimuli-responsive MOFs
have shown additional advantages for selective adsorption and separation. A number of unpredicted phenomena involved in the gas
adsorption by ﬂexible MOFs have been observed, which are not
observed in traditional porous materials. These new properties can
be used in the selective adsorption and separation of CO2 .
The MIL-53 series is representative of ﬂexible MOFs and has
been extensively investigated for CO2 and CH4 adsorption, as well
as the separation of related mixtures [48]. As mentioned above,
MIL-53(Cr) exhibits a small CO2 uptake at low pressure, however,
a distinct step is observed when increasing the pressure as the
structure opens (breathing effect), leading to a higher gas uptake;
this step is absent in the corresponding isotherm for CH4 (Fig. 23)
[104]. The adsorption of binary CO2 /CH4 mixtures in MIL-53(Cr)
showed that the breathing effect is mainly controlled by the partial
pressure of CO2 and breakthrough experiments revealed that the
CO2 /CH4 selectivity decreases as the CO2 partial pressure increases
[136].
External stimuli such as pressure and temperature can be used
to induce gating effects, which are desired for selective adsorption
and separation in some cases. This phenomenon has been observed
in several ﬂexible MOFs. For example, M(4,4 -bipy)2 (BF4 )2 (M = Cu
and Ni) and M(4,4 -bipy)2 (CF3 SO3 )2 (M = Co and Cu) [120,351]
showed a pressure induced “gate” effect in CO2 adsorption. In the
case of Cu(4,4 -bipy)2 (BF4 )2 , negligible CO2 adsorption occurs up
to a pressure of 0.7 bar at 298 K, at which point the interlayer
spacing increases to accommodate the gas molecules at higher
pressure. CH4 , on the other hand, requires a higher pressure of
4.5 bar to open the gate. Mesh-adjustable molecular sieves (MAMS)
are another class of ﬂexible MOFs with temperature dependent
selective adsorption [115,116]. Structural tailoring from modiﬁable
ligands is expected to get materials with higher selective adsorp-

tion abilities for CO2 at near room temperature. This MAMS idea
has produced a fruitful research avenue in MOFs for gas separation,
carried into execution in the authors’ groups.
5.4. Optimizing technical procedure
Apart from the design and modiﬁcation of MOFs, especially at
the molecular level as discussed above, the technical procedures
and methods should also be developed or optimized for enhancing
the CO2 separation ability in MOFs. Connected to the work performance of MOF material, these procedures can include (1) the
preparation of MOF material for separation, such as the particle size
of MOF crystals when acting as a sorbent in adsorptive separation,
and decreasing “cracking” in MOF thin ﬁlm; (2) the activation of
MOF material that is related directly to the separation performance
of the material not only in adsorptive separation but in membrane
separation; (3) the selection of separation methods that should be
dependent on the properties of the MOF that is used; (4) the manipulation of MOF materials to decrease environmental factors, such
as water, which can cause framework collapse; (5) the hybridization of MOFs with other materials, such as traditional carbon-based
sorbents and polymers. For carbon capture technologies, there are a
lot of considerations for enhancing the capture efﬁciency [1], which
are beyond the scope of this paper.
6. Conclusion and outlook
CO2 capture is attracting the broad attention of both science
and technology. In this review article, the CO2 capture related gas
adsorption, CO2 storage, selective adsorption, and gas separation in
MOFs have been discussed. Clearly, the selection of capture materials is essential for any technology in CO2 capture. Metal-organic
frameworks (MOFs) represent a new class of crystalline porous
materials with advantages such as ease of design and synthesis,
high porosity, and tailored pore properties. MOFs are promising
candidates as separation materials for CO2 capture. However, further explorations are needed in several critical issues that will
hamper the development of real-world applications if they are not
addressed [91].
In the last decade, thousands of MOFs have been synthesized and
characterized structurally, however only a small part have been
checked for CO2 adsorption, storage, and related gas separation.
Because it is unreasonable to measure all of these new materials further development of scanning techniques are recommended.
This can be used not only for ﬁnding useful materials but also for
evaluating structure–function relationships and thereby directing
the design and optimization of new MOF materials. Molecular simulation is, in fact, playing a key role in scanning MOFs for CO2

J.-R. Li et al. / Coordination Chemistry Reviews 255 (2011) 1791–1823

capture, by conﬁrming experimental results and providing further
insight into key aspects of CO2 adsorption.
The gas streams treated in practical CO2 separations always contain water and it is not economically feasible that an additional
process is added to dry the ﬂue gas before separation; separation
materials thus require a high tolerance to water. There have, however, only been a very limited number of evaluations of the effect
of water on the separation performances of MOFs. Addressing this
issue should include studies into both the physical co-adsorption
of water in the pores of MOFs and the chemisorption of water to
sites such as open metal centers, when applicable.
Besides the co-adsorption of CO2 and water, only limited data
on the co-adsorption of CO2 and other gases in MOFs has been
reported. There is no doubt that measurements of adsorption for
multi-component system are more challenging than for singlecomponent ones. However, for future application it is critical that
these kinds of tests are completed directly or that calculations
using the simple mixing theories, such as IAST, are used to get
this data. Experimental data with mixed gas systems would also
aid in the evaluation of kinetic separation, especially in advancing
the developments of MOF-based membranes for CO2 separation.
When considering MOFs for industrial separations of CO2 from
other gases, information on the reproducibility of separation performance after long-term exposure to gas streams and the response
of the materials to repetitive circulation are also needed. Continued
work in all of these areas as well as establishing standards by which
sorbents can be compared are necessary.
The sheer number of MOF structures available implies that the
ﬁeld of MOF-based membranes for CO2 capture has high potential
for rapid growth. Many of the properties that make MOFs exciting
materials have not yet been demonstrated for gas separating MOF
membranes, such as MOFs with post-synthetically functionalized
pores or inherently tunable pore sizes either of which could have
a signiﬁcant impact on MOF membrane CO2 capture performance.
Chemically decorating pores with amines or other ligands is one
example of a possible strategy for increasing CO2 afﬁnity in a MOF.
Despite the bright outlook, MOF membranes for CO2 capture
still face signiﬁcant challenges. In most cases, the organic ligands
used in synthesizing the MOFs of interest are prohibitively expensive. New, low cost ligands are necessary to realize these materials’
potential as membranes for CO2 capture in an industrial setting.
This is also a concern for adsorptive separation. It is also essential that new MOF membrane fabrication methods be developed
to overcome some of the unique challenges these materials face
such as ease of crack formation during cooling and drying and
poor support adhesion. Also, more post-synthetic functionalization
methods need to be developed to tune existing MOF membranes,
increasing CO2 permeability and CO2 /N2 selectivity to realize the
potential of these materials for CO2 capture.
Paralleling experimental studies, molecular simulation in this
ﬁeld must be further developed. It is clear that classical and
quantum-mechanical based molecular simulations are playing a
signiﬁcant role in the elucidation of adsorption and separation
mechanisms, evaluation of existent materials, and the design of
promising materials. In this sense, these techniques are a great
complement to experiments and they can save money and time
otherwise invested in a much larger set of costly and difﬁcult experiments especially in the screening stages.
In particular, for example, the simulation results have shown
the role of electrostatic interactions, resulting in the identiﬁcation
of ionic MOFs as promising materials for CO2 capture. Molecular
simulations have also helped to elucidate other factors such as
the effect of impurities in the adsorption and separation of mixtures, the existence of structural changes giving rise to breathing
phenomena in ﬂexible frameworks, the elucidation of transport
mechanisms, and the roles of geometry, pore size, and nature of

1819

the molecular interactions on preferential adsorption. With respect
to selectivity properties, simulations are crucial to understand the
effects of overall composition, pressure, loading, and temperature,
and to characterize the inﬂuence of complex ﬂuid phenomena such
as phase transitions and clustering.
In recent decades, tremendous advances in computational hardware have given a great impulse to the recognition of simulations
as the “theoretical microscope”. In adsorption theory, going beyond
the IAST is important as we deal with more complex molecular
interactions. To accomplish this goal, accurate parameterization of
effective force ﬁelds used in classical molecular simulations need
the input from ab initio and quantum-mechanical density functional theory methods. Recent DFT developments have been able to
provide better descriptions of weak dispersion interactions that are
being tested for gas adsorption and separation, and more work will
be needed to assess and further develop improved functions. Preliminary but promising screening methodologies have already been
implemented that allow rapid analyses of large groups of materials;
this is another area where additional advances are foreseen. Finally,
new techniques, especially innovative combination of molecular
modeling methods that address different scales of length and time
will be extremely useful in this ﬁeld.
It is evident that the combination of material design, synthesis,
characterization, calculational simulation, and ﬁnally implementation requires plentiful knowledge and expertise, which can only
be afforded through extensive collaborations of scientists with
different scientiﬁc backgrounds [18]. This should culminate in
collaboration between scientists and engineers to ﬁgure out the
solution to the CCS problem we are facing. Speciﬁcally, what the
most promising materials in an industrial separation process for
CO2 capture are. In addition, the implementation costs for industrially relevant scale-up of new materials must be evaluated. The
ease and cost of synthesis of MOFs in large scale for example, will
be extremely signiﬁcant in determining their applicability in future
industry.
