a b s t r a c t
Metallophthalocyanines conﬁned on the surface of electrodes are active catalysts for a large variety of
electrochemical reactions and electrode surfaces modiﬁed by these complexes can be obtained by simple
adsorption on graphite and carbon. However, more stable electrodes can be achieved by coating their
surfaces with electropolymerized layers of the complexes, that show similar activity than their monomer
counterparts. In all cases, fundamental studies carried out with adsorbed layers of these complexes have
shown that the redox potential is a very good reactivity index for predicting the catalytic activity of
the complexes. Volcano-shaped correlations have been found between the electrocatalytic activity (as
log I at constant E) versus the Co(II)/(I) formal potential (E◦ ) of Co-macrocyclics for the oxidation of
several thiols, hydrazine and glucose. For the electroreduction of O2 only linear correlations between
the electrocatalytic activity versus the M(III)/M(II) formal potential have been found using Cr, Mn, Fe
and Co phthalocyanines but it is likely that these correlations are “incomplete volcano” correlations.
The volcano correlations strongly suggest that E◦ , the formal potential of the complex needs to be

in a rather narrow potential window for achieving maximum activity, probably corresponding to surface
coverages of an M-molecule adduct equal to 0.5 and to standard free energies of adsorption of the reacting
molecule on the complex active site equal to zero. These results indicate that the catalytic activity of
metallophthalocyanines for the oxidation of several molecules can be “tuned” by manipulating the E◦
formal potential, using proper groups on the macrocyclic ligand. This review emphasizes once more
that metallophthalocyanines are extremely versatile materials with many applications in electrocatalysis,
electroanalysis, just to mention a few, and they provide very good models for testing their catalytic activity
for several reactions. Even though the earlier applications of these complexes were focused on providing
active materials for electroreduction of O2 , for making active cathodes for fuel cells, the main trend in the
literature nowadays is to use these complexes for making active electrodes for electrochemical sensors.

1. Introduction
Metallophthalocyanines MPcs are extremely versatile materials.
They belong to a class of transition metal complexes known as N4macrocyclic complexes and they possess a N4 inner structure that
is common in naturally occurring molecules such as chlorophyll,
heme groups in hemoglobin, cytochrome c, vitamin B12 , etc. Due to
their macrocyclic nature including extended ␲-systems, phthalocyanines are capable of undergoing fast redox processes, with
minimal reorganizational energies and can act as mediators in electron transfer processes involving a great variety of molecules [1–5].
In this review we will concentrate our attention on the catalytic
activity of phthalocyanines for electrochemical reactions. This was
ﬁrst reported four decades ago in a pioneering study by Jasinski
[6,7] while searching for non-noble catalysts for the oxygen cathode in fuel cells. He showed that Co phthalocyanine is active for the
reduction of O2 . This triggered extensive research in many places in
the world on N4 macrocyclic metal chelates as possible electrocatalysts for the reduction of O2 for the development of low cost fuel
cells, with the aim of replacing platinum, which is the best catalyst
known for the reduction of O2 . This topic has been the subject of
several reviews [8–28] and the feasibility of using phthalocyanines
in practical fuel cells has been shown recently [29].
MPcs constitute an interesting type of catalysts since they
present several advantages over noble metals, not only because
of the cost. In particular, they provide very interesting models for
theoretical and experimental studies since their catalytic action
can be described in terms of deﬁnite parameters such as chemical
structure and chemical and physical properties. Their reactive centers are clearly identiﬁed and their reactivity can be modulated by
changing the nature of the central metal or by modifying the structure of the macrocyclic ligand. Fig. 1 illustrates the structures of
some metallophthalocyanines and related macrocyclic complexes
that have been studied as catalysts for electrochemical reactions.
All the work published to date shows that MPcs have a
very wide range of applications in electrochemistry varying from
energy conversion devices to electrochemical sensors for the
detection of molecules of biological and environmental relevance. In the earlier studies, most of the work was focused on
the reduction of molecular O2 but was later shown over the
years that they catalyze a myriad of reactions. Some phthalocyanines and related macrocyclic complexes catalyze (i) the
electrooxidation of formic acid [8,30], CO [8,29–33], SO2 [34–36],
oxalic acid [37–48], glucose [49–63], molecular hydrogen [64–68],
H2 O2 [67–69], hydrazine [8,30,47,70–88], nitrite [89,90], mercaptoethanol [91–93], l-cysteine [71,94–106], sulﬁde ion [107],
thiocyanate [102,108,109], hydroxylamine [74,88,110–112], NO
[113–119], dopamine [120–122], the evolution of oxygen [123,124]
and the oxidation of phenols [125–128]; (ii) the electroreduction
of H2 O2 [129,130], protons [131], CO2 [132–140], alkylchlorides [141,142], cystine [94,143], molecular nitrogen [144], N2 O
[145,146], NO [147], nitrite [111], nitrate [148–150], thionyl chloride [151–167] and sulfuryl chloride [153]. They are also good

catalyst in hydrogenation reactions [165]. MPcs are also promising as electrode materials not only as catalysts but also as reactive
species in lithium cells [166–168].
MPcs are also promising for promoting photocatalytic reactions. They can act as spectroscopic sensitizers deposited on
semiconductor electrodes [169–188] and can have applications
in solar energy conversion devices. The colour of phthalocyanines
is modiﬁed when they undergo oxidation state changes involving the ligand and this can have applications in electrochromic
devices [189–191]. Rare-earth diphthalocyanines are noticeable
by their electrochromic reversibility which allows their use as
electro-optic transducers in plate screens [192–194]. However we
will not discuss these applications as they are beyond the scope of
the present review.

2. Metallophthalocyanine-based molecular electrodes
Most MPcs are insoluble in water and they can be conﬁned
on electrode surfaces, to yield “metallophthalocyanine-based
molecular electrodes”. They can be attached to an electrode
surface by vacuum sublimation, vapor deposition, precipitation,
adsorption from a solution in an organic solvent or concentrated
acid, polymerization by heat treatment in the presence of carbon
powders (and the electrode is then made with the resulting mixture) and electrochemical polymerization, etc. Fig. 2 illustrates the
different approaches for immobilizing MPcs on electrode surfaces.
Adsorption of the complexes on graphite or carbon materials (see
Fig. 2a) has been the preferred method of most authors due to
its simplicity and because it provides reproducible results. The
modiﬁed electrode can be characterized by simple techniques,
like cyclic voltammetry which allows the estimation of the formal
potentials of redox processes involving the immobilized complex
and also the amount of electroactive molecules present on the
electrode surface. In a typical experiment, the adsorption of monolayers of MPc is simply achieved by dipping the electrode into
solutions of the complexes in an appropriate solvent for several
minutes, or placing a drop of these solutions on the electrode
surface and then rinsing with ethanol or other solvent to eliminate
any excess of non-adsorbed complex.
The use of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of alkylthio-,
arylthio- and thiol-derivatized phthalocyanines [57,82,102,
109,195–208] is a rather new and convenient method for immobilizing these macrocyclic complexes on gold surfaces. Indeed,
thiol derivatized macrocyclic bound to a gold substrate via their
thiol arms lead to the formation of reproducible and stable ﬁlms
of SAMs. A schematic representation of these SAMs is given in
Fig. 2b–d. Such a monolayer of highly oriented molecules on a
substrate is formed spontaneously by immersing a solid substrate
into a solution containing the desired species with an appropriate
functional group. Careful placement of thiol groups of the adsorbate can constrain the resulting molecule to a particular packing
preference on the electrode surface (see Fig. 2b and c).

J.H. Zagal et al. / Coordination Chemistry Reviews 254 (2010) 2755–2791

Another approach for modifying surfaces is to use polymeric
phthalocyanines. Polymeric ﬁlms containing MPcs can be formed
on different conductive substrates by electropolymerizing a functionalized monomeric phthalocyanine directly onto a surface of

2757

an electrode or by coating the electrode with a preformed polymer (Fig. 2e). Alternatively, these complexes can be incorporated
into preformed polymers [131,139,209–224], plasma polymerized
[224–227] onto substrates or formed by the Langmuir–Blodgett

method [198,228]. The electrochemical polymerization is an elegant, attractive and easy strategy for the immobilization of metal
complexes [229–236] providing relatively stable ﬁlms. The principle is based on the electrochemical oxidation (or reduction)
of a polymerizable group present on the phthalocyanine ligand.
The obtained polymeric ﬁlms should be electronic conductors
to ensure the continuous growth of the polymeric ﬁlm and to
allow electron transfer processes within the matrix. Pyrrole, thiophene and aniline-based monomers have been the most commonly
used materials [234–237]. Such chemically substituted monomers
have many interesting features including a high ﬂexibility in their
molecular design. Additionally, such materials offer the possibility of using either aqueous or organic solutions to carry out the
electropolymerization. One of the ﬁrst examples that involved
the incorporation of MPcs into polypyrrole ﬁlms was based on
the ion-exchange properties of the oxidized polymer. Tetrasulfonated substituted complexes [238–245] have been introduced
into polypyrrole ﬁlms as counter-ions (or “doping” ions). Only
few examples have described the electropolymerization of pyrrolesubstituted MPcs [246–248]. Most studies of polymeric MPcs have
involved the electrochemical polymerization of tetraaminoph-

thalocyanines (4␤(NH2 )MPc) [77,119,137,230,249–255] which
involves the oxidation of the amino group to form radicals that
initiate condensation by attacking phenyl rings of neighboring molecules. An illustration of a hypothetical polymer coating
is given in Fig. 2e. 4␤(NH2 )MPc has been electropolymerized
on glassy carbon electrode [77,119,121,252,253,256–262], ITO
[77,241,258,260,262] and highly oriented pyrolytic graphite electrode [254]. Of the 4␤(NH2 )MPc complexes, most studies have
concentrated on 4␤(NH2 )CoPc due the excellent electrocatalytic
behavior of this complex towards a variety of electrochemical reactions.
Fig. 3 shows very schematically a hypothetical catalytic process promoted by “MPcs based molecular electrode”. The scheme is
shown for a reduction process but a similar one can be shown for an
oxidation process. In some reactions mediated by MPcs, the complex changes oxidation states upon interacting with the reacting
molecule and it recovers its initial oxidation state by accepting or
donating electrons to the electrode. So the electrode acts simply as
a sink or a source of electrons that are exchanged with the surfaceconﬁned phthalocyanine molecule. As it will be discussed further,
the formal potentials of the catalyst are correlated to the electro-

catalytic activity. Table 1 recapitulates some signiﬁcant examples
of MPcs based molecular electrodes and their use for the activation
of various analytes [263–320].
3. Catalytic properties of MPcs in electrochemical reactions
involving thiols
Metallophthalocyanines and related complexes exhibit catalytic
activity for the electrochemical oxidation of a great variety of thiols
[14,21,100,274,284–287,290–292,321–338] and for the reduction
of the corresponding disulﬁdes [100]. These “molecular phthalocyanine electrodes” act by lowering the overpotential of oxidation or
reduction of the target molecules [14]. Studies of the electrooxidation of thiols to give the corresponding disulﬁdes have shown
that the catalytic activity of the molecular electrodes strongly
depends on the nature of the central metal, with cobalt derivatives
exhibiting the highest activity [14]. The rates of the electrochemical oxidation of thiols are also strongly dependent of the nature of
the N4 -macrocyclic ligand.
The electrocatalytic oxidation of thiols and many other reactions discussed in this review can be considered as inner-sphere
reactions since a bond between a sulfur atom and the active site

is expected to occur before or when the electron transfer takes
place [14]. In some cases, this interaction can be so strong that the
catalytic process is inhibited as the active sites are blocked by the
reacting molecules bound to the active sites in the phthalocyanine.
Indeed, in the case of polymeric tetraaminocobalt phthalocyanine poly-4␤(NH2 )CoPc deposited on transparent indium tin oxide
(ITO) electrodes, there is in situ evidence that an adduct is formed
between this molecule and 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME) [292,329].
This adduct, if it is labile, could be a precursor in the electrocatalytic process of oxidation of thiols. Further, electroreﬂectance
spectroscopy studies on Co and Fe tetrasulfonated phthalocyanines
adsorbed on the basal plane of highly oriented pyrolytic graphite
electrodes have demonstrated that under open-circuit conditions,
in basic deaerated aqueous solutions, the thiol, l-cysteine, reduces
the metal in the adsorbed phthalocyanine from M(II) to M(I) [330]
suggesting that the M(II)/M(I) redox couple in the phthalocyanine
plays a role in the catalytic process.
In earlier studies of the electrocatalytic activity of MPcs for
the oxidation of thiols such as 2-ME and 2-aminoethanethiol
[290,333,334,338–340] the catalytic activity (measured as current
at constant potential) followed a linear correlation with the redox
potential (driving force) of the complex, when immobilized on

graphite electrodes. The activity increases as the M(II)/M(I) formal potential of the catalyst becomes more negative, that is to
say, the activity increases when the driving force of the catalyst
decreases. This is contrary to what is expected on thermodynamic
grounds. In contrast, for the reduction of 2-mercaptodisulﬁde the
activity increases as the Co(II)/Co(I) becomes more negative [296],
that is the activity increases when the driving force of the catalyst increases (as expected), since the latter is a reduction reaction.
However, it was shown later that if complexes exhibiting formal
potentials in a wide range are examined, the complete correlation
follows a volcano-shape [92,295,340]. Indeed for the oxidation of
2-ME in a study using ﬁve cobalt complexes including porphyrins
and phthalocyanines bearing Co(II)/Co(I) redox potentials in the
range −1.2 V to −0.6 V, a volcano plot was obtained [295] with Cotetraaminophenylporphyin having a Co(II)/Co(I) formal potential
at ca. −0.9 V versus SCE showing the highest activity. More correlations of this type were reported later using adsorbed substituted
metallo tetraphenylporphyrins and metallo phthalocyanines with
Co as the central metal with substituents on the N4 ligand, using
both electron-donor and electron-acceptor groups to modulate the
Co(II)/Co(I) redox potentials in a wide range [340]. The volcano correlations indicate that the redox potential of the catalyst needs to
be “tuned” in a rather narrow potential range for achieving maximum activity. These observations have an impact on the search
for catalysts for applications in electrocatalysis and the development of electrochemical sensors as will be discussed further
[321].
In this section we focused on the description of some signiﬁcant
recent examples reported in the literature related to the electroactivation of thiols by “molecular phthalocyanine electrodes”. It is
aimed at showing how the redox and electrocatalytic activities of
the electrodes can be ﬁnely tuned in order to control the electron
transfer rates. Also, a tentative elucidation of a possible empirical
correlation between the experimentally established data and theoretical calculations will be reported and discussed. Table 2 shows a
selection of thiols activated by several types of “molecular phthalocyanine electrodes”.

As stated in the ﬁrst part, the catalytic activity of the MN4 complexes strongly depends on the nature of the central metal but also
on the nature of the ligand. We will also describe below the studies that support the inﬂuence of these parameters on the catalytic
activity towards the oxidation of thiols.
All adsorbed CoPcs complexes exhibit a reversible pair of
peaks between −0.8 and 0.0 V versus SCE that has been tentatively assigned to the Co(II)/Co(I) reversible process [338]. As
expected, the formal potential of the Co(II)/Co(I) redox process
shifts to more negative values by the effect of electron donating groups (8␤(OC8 H17 )CoPc, 8␤(OCH3 )CoPc, 4␤(OC5 H11 )CoPc and
4␤(NH2 )CoPc) since these groups increase the electron density on
the metal center, faciliting the oxidation of the Co center compared
to H-substituted CoPc. The opposite effect is observed for electron
withdrawing groups, as the formal potential shifts to more positive values in comparison to CoPc. This is illustrated in Fig. 4 that
shows a linear correlation between the Co(II)/Co(I) formal potential and the sum of the Hammett parameters of some examples
of substituents on the ligand. This shows that the redox potential
of Co phthalocynine can be modulated, by choosing the appropriate substituents on the ligand. This is true for phthalocyanines of
other metals, as has been shown in a series of papers by Lever and
co-workers [21,88,111,146].
Fig. 5 illustrates a typical cyclic voltammogram for
4␤(OC5 H11 )CoPc adsorbed on OPG, after adding 1 mmol L−1
of 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME) to 0.5 mol L−1 NaOH solution [339].
A large oxidation current is observed starting at −0.5 V versus SCE,
which corresponds to the electrocatalytic oxidation of 2-ME at
the molecular phthalocyanine electrode. The appearance of the
oxidation peak at Epa = +0.38 V versus SCE is concomitant with the
reduction peak at −0.75 V versus SCE, during the reverse scan. This
large cathodic peak is related to the reduction of the corresponding
disulﬁde. Oxidation of 2-ME on the bare OPG electrode is only
observed as a peak at +0.07 V versus SCE with no reduction peak
in the potential range examined. This clearly shows that cobalt
phthalocyanine layer not only acts as a catalyst towards the
oxidation of 2-ME but also for the reduction of the corresponding
disulﬁde. This has also been observed for the oxidation of 2-ME on
Fe phthalocyanines and the more active the catalysts, the smaller
the separation between the 2ME oxidation peak and the disulﬁde
reduction peak [290].

The catalytic activity of MPcs for the oxidation of thiols is
strongly dependent on the nature of the metal in the macrocycle
[14,21,321]. When comparing the activity of phthalocyanines of
different metals for the oxidation of 2-ME, the highest activity was
shown by CoPc and FePc [91]. CoPc and 4((SO3 − )CoPc complexes
were the most active (compared to MnPc, FePc, NiPc and CuPc) for
the electrocatalytic oxidation of l-cysteine [74].
The catalytic activity of ring substituted 4␤(NO2 )CoPc,
4␤(NH2 )CoPc, 4␤(C(CH3 )3 )CoPc, 4␤(SO3 − )CoPc and 4␤(COOH)
CoPc adsorbed onto glassy carbon electrode increased with the
ring substituent as follows: 4␤(COOH)CoPc > 4␤(C(CH3 )3 )CoPc
> 4␤(SO3 − )CoPc > 4␤(NH2 )CoPc > 4␤(NO2 )CoPc. The potential for
the catalytic oxidation of l-cysteine was closely related to the

Co(III)/Co(II) couple of the CoPc species in acid media and to
Co(II)/Co(I) couple in basic media [284]. The Fe(II)/Fe(I) couple
has also been associated with the electrocatalytic oxidation of lcysteine by 4␤(SO3 − )FePc [330].
The study on the effect of ring substituents on the electrocatalytic behavior of iron phthalocyanines (4␤(SO3 − )FePc,
4␤(COOH)FePc, 8␤(OCH3 )FePc, 16(F)FePc and FePc) adsorbed on
ordinary pyrolytic graphite electrode, for the oxidation of 2-ME
[53], showed that complexes containing electron-withdrawing
groups (–CO2 − , –SO3 − , Cl− ) shifted the catalytic peak to more
positive potentials, and the ones containing electron-donating
methoxy groups to more negative potentials [290] as discussed
above for Co complexes. The catalytic activity was measured by

cysteine and reduced glutathione showing that only a few external
layers of the polymer are electroactive. Poly-4␤(NH2 )CoPc shows
catalytic activity for both the oxidation of thiols and the reduction
of the corresponding disulﬁdes [274].
In addition to studies on adsorbed monomers, polymers and
SAMs, other methods of electrode modiﬁcations for the detection of
thiols have been explored. CoPc supported on poly(2-chloroaniline)
was active for the electrooxidation of 2-ME, reduced glutathione
and hydrazine [293]. The use of CoPc composite electrode resulted
in the lowering of overpotential for glutathione oxidation by 0.75 V
[343] compared to the unmodiﬁed carbon electrode. Also, MPc
modiﬁed carbon paste electrodes have been employed by several
authors for the analysis of thiols. Carbon paste electrodes incorporating OMoV (OH)Pc catalyze the oxidation l-cysteine with a
considerable reduction in overpotential [287], and it was proposed
that the oxidation of l-cysteine is mediated by MoVI Pc species [287].
Very few metalloporphyrins have been investigated for the
oxidation of thiols [292]. For example studies using electropolymerized aminophenyl and hydroxyphenyl cobalt porphyrins
have shown some activity [292,344] but they are less active
than phthalocyanines. These differences in behavior have been
attributed to a different electrocatalytic mechanism and/or to differences in the polymer ﬁlm conductivities. However, as it will be
discussed further on, Co porphyrins exhibit Co(II)/(I) formal potentials which are much more negative than those of phthalocyanines,
so the interaction of the sulﬁde ion with the Co(II) center to form a
Co(I) adduct is less favorable with porphyrins.

the difference in peak potentials between the oxidation peak of
the RSH and the reduction peak of the product (RSSR). That is,
the lower the potential peak separation of the RSH/RSSR couple, the higher the catalytic activity. Based on this observation,
the catalytic activities of the complexes increase as follows:
8␤(OCH3 )FePc > FePc > 4␤(COOH)FePc > 4␤(SO3 − )FePc > 16(F)FePc
[290]. Similarly, 8␤(OC8 H17 )CoPc monomer adsorbed onto
graphite electrodes shows a higher catalytic activity towards
oxidation of 2-ME than adsorbed 4␤(SO3 − )CoPc or CoPc due to
the electron-donating ability of the ethylhexyloxy substituents in
the former [333]. These differences in activities can be attributed
to the different redox properties of the complexes, as it will be
discussed further on.
Platinum group metal monophthalocyanines adsorbed on glassy
carbon electrode catalyze the oxidation of l-cysteine depending
on the nature of axial ligands [286]. When DMSO or cyanide were
employed as axial ligands, catalytic activity was observed and ringbased redox processes were implicated in the catalytic process.
Oxidation of l-cysteine on MPc–SAMs formed from thiol substituted MPc complexes, was observed at lower potentials compared
to the potential observed for its oxidation on unmodiﬁed CoPc
[96,293,341,342]. The overpotentials for oxidation of homocysteine, l-cysteine and penicyllamine are slightly lower on alkylthio
substituted FePc complexes compared to the corresponding CoPc
ones [108], however the latter was less susceptible to fouling
[108]. Of a series of MPc-4-MPy-SAM (M = Fe, Mn, Co and 4-MPy = 4-mercaptopyridine) used for catalytic oxidation of l-cysteine,
FePc-4-MPy-SAM showed better catalytic activity [102].
The sensitivity and stability of poly-4␤(NH2 )CoPc were much
higher than for adsorbed monomer for 2-ME oxidation [274] or to
be similar to that of adsorbed 4␤(NH2 )CoPc (on vitreous carbon
electrode) in terms of current and peak potential [335] for l-

3.2. General trends in reactivity of macrocyclics for the oxidation
of thiols
It is very important in electrocatalysis to be able to make predictions about the eventual catalytic activity of an electrode. This is
especially important if the active electrode contains a metal complex having a reactivity that can be controlled by its molecular
and electronic structure. However the theory of electrocatalysis is still underdeveloped. Predictions of reactivities, with a few
notable exceptions, have been thus far mainly based on correlative
approaches. Along these lines, most of the work published has been
focused on the electrocatalytic activity of pure metals, alloys or
metal oxides for well known reactions such as hydrogen evolution,
hydrogen oxidation, O2 evolution or O2 reduction which are the
reactions occurring in H2 /O2 fuel cells and water electrolyzers. Crucial parameters that correlate with catalytic activity are heats and
free energies of adsorption of intermediates that account for the
degree of interaction of the reacting molecule with the active sites
located on the metal or metal oxide surface [345–361]. The adsorption phenomenon lowers activation energies for the processes.
In relation to the electrocatalytic activity of electrodes modiﬁed
with metallophthalocyanines or complexes in general there are no
models available. However correlations can be found if the reactivity is compared versus some parameter that accounts for the
reactivity of the active site which is the central metal. One useful parameter is the redox potential of the complex and can be
easily determined by cyclic voltammetry, under the same conditions (pH, electrolyte composition, temperature) employed for the
kinetic measurements. As shown recently, non-linear correlations
are found between the redox potential of the metal complex and
the catalytic activity, expressed as log i at constant potential or
potential at constant current density. This is not only valid for the
oxidation of thiols but also for many other reactions promoted by
these MN4 complexes [14,27,321] as it will be discussed further
down.
Tafel plots are very common in kinetic studies of electrode processes. They correlate currents or current densities (i or I) with
electrode potentials (E versus a reference electrode potential) or

2764

since the Tafel lines (which are linear only at low potentials) appear
at the more positive potentials. Plots similar to those in Fig. 6 are
obtained with other phthalocyanines and also for the oxidation of
other thiols, so it can be proposed that the rate determining step for
the oxidation of thiol is step (3) in the mechanism depicted below.
The oxidation of thiols in alkaline media most likely involves the
formation of a bond between the metal center in the complex and
the sulfur atom in the thiolate. The complete reaction scheme is:

overpotentials Á. The overpotential Á = E − Eeq is a measure of the
departure from the equilibrium Eeq . The current density is the current divided by the area of the electrode. The electrical current
ﬂowing through the electrode is proportional to the reaction rate,
and the electrode potential is proportional to the driving force. The
rate of an electrochemical reaction increases exponentially with
the electrode potential. For a chemical reaction the driving force is
G◦ , the standard free energy of the reaction. For an electrochemical reaction, the driving force of the reaction can be modiﬁed by the
electrode potential, since G = −nFE where E is the potential of the
cell. For a reduction reaction the driving force can be increased by
applying a negative potential. The opposite is true for an oxidation.
The Tafel equation is: log i = log io + Á/b where i is the current density, io is the exchange current density, b is the Tafel slope and Á is
the overpotential. Á = E − Eeq where E is the potential and Eeq is the
equilibrium potential of the reaction versus a reference electrode
(given by the Nernst equation).
A Tafel plot is a graph of log i versus E, and according to the
equation it should be linear, with a slope of 1/b. So essentially
a Tafel plot is a plot of log(reaction rate) versus driving force. A
bit far from equilibrium these plots are linear and the Tafel slope
ıE/ı log i provides information about the rate determining step. A
common slope is 0.118 V/decade indicating that the reaction rate
is increased 10 times if the potential applied to the electrode is
increased by 0.118 V, for an oxidation process. A Tafel slope close
to 0.118 V/decade is indicative that the ﬁrst one-electron transfer
is rate determining. A Tafel slope close to 0.059 V/decade indicates
that the ﬁrst fast electron transfer is followed by a slow chemical step. A Tafel slope close to 0.040 V indicates that the ﬁrst fast
electron transfer is followed by a slow electron transfer step. For
catalytic processes the smaller the Tafel slope the better since it
indicates the magnitude of applied potential required to increase
the rate 10 times, the lower the energy required to push the reaction. The Tafel equation is an empiric equation and a more rigorous
correlation between the current and the potential is given by the
Butler–Volmer equation and the interested reader can consult several text books available in electrochemistry.
Fig. 6 illustrates a series of Tafel plots obtained with pyrolytic
graphite modiﬁed with tetrasulfonated phthalocyanines of Cr, Mn,
Co, Fe, Ni, Cu and Zn for the oxidation of 2-mercaptoethanol. The
response of the bare graphite is also shown. The slopes of the lines
range from 0.10 to 0.120 V/decade suggesting that the ﬁrst oneelectron transfer step is rate determining, for the oxidation of 2-ME
with all catalysts. The most active one is 4␤(SO3 − )CoPc as the Tafel
lines appear at lower potentials. The least active is bare graphite,

where “sol” and “ads” stand for species in solution or adsorbed on
the electrode, respectively. Step 4 is fast and irreversible. A crucial
step is step 2, which involves the formation of a Co–S bond, with
a partial reduction of the metal center in the catalyst and partial
oxidation of the bound thiol molecule.
As pointed out above, the redox potential can be used as a
parameter of reactivity as reduction of the metal center is involved
in step 2. Two approaches can be used to modify and modulate
the redox potential of the complexes: (a) by changing the metal
but keeping the same phthalocyanine ligand or (b) keeping the
metal but changing the ligand by using different substituted
phthalocyanines.
By using approach (a) Fig. 7 compares the reactivity of two families of MPc for the oxidation of 2-ME, namely unsubstituted and
tetrasulfonated phthalocyanines [331,333,334]. The activity as log i
(current density) at constant potential has been plotted versus the
redox potential of the ﬁrst reduction process of the catalyst (called
“formal redox potential of the catalyst”). This redox potential might
involve the M(II)/(I) couple for Cr, Mn, Co and Fe but might involve
the ligand for Ni and Cu. Since these redox potentials are obtained
from the potential of voltammetric peaks at which the surface
concentration of oxidized species is equal to the surface concentrations of reduced species, these potentials are then formal potentials
“E◦ ”. In Fig. 7 a linear correlation is observed for both families of
phthalocyanines and the activity increases as the redox potential
becomes more positive. One would expect this on thermodynamic
grounds if the formal potential of the catalyst represents part of the
driving force of the reaction (apart from the electrode potential,
which in this case has been kept constant). However, activity
should also increase if the afﬁnity of the central metal for the thiol
increases, i.e. as the M–Co energy bond increases. In the data shown
in Fig. 7 the effect of the ligand depends on the nature of the central
metal. When comparing CrPc with 4␤(SO3 − )CrPc, CrPc is more
active than 4␤(SO3 − )CrPc. In contrast 4␤(SO3 − )CuPc is more active
than CuPc but in both cases no deviations are observed from the
linear correlation, so the redox potential is a good reactivity index
for these complexes no matter what central metal or what ligand is
considered.
An interesting feature in the correlations of Fig. 7 is that
the slopes for both families of phthalocyanines are different.
For unsubstituted MPcs, the slope is 0.070 V/decade whereas for
4␤(SO3 − )MPcs the slope is 0.14 V/decade. These slopes are not Tafel
slopes since the data were obtained at constant potential (constant
driving force of the electrode) and the driving force was varied
by changing the redox potential of the catalyst but essentially,
they have a similar meaning to Tafel slopes, since these slopes
are (ıE◦ /ı log i)E , where E◦ is the formal potential of the catalyst
instead of (ıE/ı log i)E◦ , the Tafel slopes obtained for a given catalyst (constant E◦ ). On the other hand, Tafel slopes obtained from
plots of log i versus potential for all catalysts included in Fig. 6 are
less than 0.118 V/decade [91,333], and depend on the particular

catalyst. As seen from the data in Tables 3 and 4, the slopes tend
to be lower for the most active catalysts, so the symmetry factor ˇ
varies between 0.28 and 0.65. The Tafel slope is 2.3RT/ˇF and for a
symmetrical energy barrier ˇ = 0.5 and the slope is 0.118 V/decade,
that indicates that the ﬁrst electron transfer is rate determining.
Slopes close to 0.118 V are also observed for the oxidation
of other thiols like l-cysteine catalyzed by several metallophthalocyanines [95], the oxidation of mercaptoacetate [340] and
aminoethanethiol [338]. The values of the Tafel slopes have been
used to justify that the transfer of one electron in step 3 is rate
controlling in alkaline media. The linear dependence of log i on
the redox potential in Fig. 7 indicates that the free energy of
adsorption of the thiol on the active sites is proportional to the
redox potential of the catalyst. If this is true, the slope would be
ˇ Gads where
Gads would account for the thermodynamics
of step 2. Note that ˇ is a Brönsted coefﬁcient not necessarily
equal to the transfer coefﬁcient ˇ, linked to the r.d.s. 3. This is
generally observed for correlations of this type when comparing
the electrocatalytic activity of metals [344–353]. Similar correlations to those in Fig. 7 are found for the oxidation of l-cysteine

on MPcs and 4␤(SO3 − )MPcs with similar slopes [331,333,334], so
these correlations seem to be independent of the nature of the
thiol. However, only Mn, Fe and Co and probably Cr exhibit redox
processes located on the metal, namely the M(II)/M(I) process
while for Ni and Cu the redox potential plotted in Fig. 7 involves
the ligand. Thus, when different central metals are compared,
different frontier orbitals in the metal could be involved for each
particular case, when adsorption of RS− takes place. For example
for complexes having central metals like Fe and Co, which have a
frontier orbital with more d character, one would expect a stronger
interaction of the metal with the thiol than, for example, Cu.
Since the redox potential (formal potential) of the catalyst
is a good reactivity index for predicting the catalytic activity
of these complexes, it is interesting to compare the activity of
complexes using approach (b), i.e. by keeping the same metal
center but modulating the redox potential by placing different substituents (electron-withdrawing or electron-donating groups) on
the phthalocyanine ligand. Fig. 8 compares the catalytic activity of
different iron phthalocyanines versus the Fe(II)/Fe(I) formal potential for the oxidation of 2-ME [290]. In contrast to what is observed
for phthalocyanines of different metals, the activity decreases as
the formal potential of the catalyst becomes more positive and the

slope (ıE◦ /ı log i)E is −0.205 V/decade (−3.47RT/F) for E = −0.30 V
versus SCE and −0.370 V/decade (−6.27RT/F) for E = −0.25 V versus SCE. Similar results were reported for the oxidation 2-ME
[333] and for the oxidation of aminoethanethiol [338] on different Co phthalocyanines. For cobalt substituted phthalocyanines,
the slopes of the plots of log i versus redox potential are also negative and potential-dependent for the oxidation of several thiols, as
illustrated in Table 5.
In order to explore a wider range of Co(II)/Co(I) redox potentials, cobalt porphyrins together with cobalt phthalocyanines and
vitamin B12 (aquocobalamine) were investigated and the results
are included in Fig. 9 for the oxidation of 2-ME. In this case a
volcano-shaped curve is obtained, with a region where the activity increases with the formal potential of the catalyst and another
region where the activity decreases. The slope, (ıE◦ /ı log i)E of
the rising portion of the volcano is 0.110 V/decade or 1.86RT/F
and the falling portion has a reciprocal slope of −0.245 V/decade
or −4.15RT/F. The slope of the rising portion of the volcano is
similar to the Tafel slopes obtained from Tafel plots for single
catalysts (see Fig. 6). Similar results are obtained for the oxidation of 2-ME when glassy carbon is used instead of pyrolytic
graphite [295] (see Tables 6 and 7), which shows that the cor-

relations do not depend on the substrate used for conﬁning the

A volcano-shaped correlation is also obtained for the oxidation of 2-mercaptoacetate and the data are illustrated in Fig. 10.
The volcano correlation includes again several types of macrocyclic
complexes, i.e. Co porphyrins, Co phthalocyanines and cyanocobalamin (vitamin B12 ). As observed for the oxidation of 2-ME a linear
region of positive slope (0.112 V/decade) is observed and then a
region where activity decreases with the formal potential of the
catalysts with a slope equal to −0.171 V/decade.
It is well-known in heterogeneous catalysis and electrocatalysis
[345–361] that a volcano-shape curve is obtained when the activity of the catalyst (logarithm of current density) for a given reaction
is plotted versus a parameter related to the ability of the catalyst
to form chemical bonds with reactants, reaction intermediates or
products [298,350–360]. So in some cases that we have discussed
before, where linear correlations are obtained, these are probable

“incomplete” volcano correlations. These relations are very important as they serve as guidelines in the search of new catalysts for any
given reaction. It is important for these correlations to be valid that
the rate determining step of the reaction is the same for all catalysts,
and this is the case for the data reported in Figs. 9 and 10. Heats of
adsorptions of the molecules on different catalysts or bond energies between active site and the adsorbed molecule are generally
used in volcano plots [345]. In the case of the data in Figs. 9 and 10,
the redox potential is used since heats and free energies of adsorption of thiols on the different metal N4 -macrocycles, to best of our
knowledge, are not available in the literature. However the formal
potential is related to the reactivity of the metal center towards the
thiol through adduct formation and to the thermodynamics of this
process (step 2). Thus, the data in the volcano plots can be explained
according the above written mechanism (the thiolate is used since
all data were obtained in alkaline media (pH in the range 10–13).
Since the active sites (the metal center in the phthalocyanine) are
well separated from the neighboring phthalocyanine molecule, it
is expected that the free energy of adsorption of thiolate molecules
on the metal centers is independent of coverage. Then it seems suitable to use a Langmuir isotherm [345,362,363] for the adsorption
of thiolate molecules on the metal centers as follows:
− GRS−
Â

where Â is the coverage of thiolate RS− and GRS− is the free energy
of adsorption of RS− (as [R-S· · ·M(I)Pc] in Eq. (2) relative to aRS−

sol
the solution activity of the thiolate. GRS− is essentially the free
energy of step 2. Solving for Â, one obtains:

− GRS− could depend on electrode potential since the process
involves a charged species and could also depend on coverage. If
one assumes that the electrochemical r.d.s. has a rate constant of
k = Cexp + (1 − ␤)EF/RT at Â = (1 − Â) = 0.5 (where E is the potential
on some nominal scale and C is a constant). Assuming that the barrier height is changed by +ˇ GRS− in the presence of adsorption
keeping in mind that adsorption acts on the initial state (step 2)
whereas E affects step 3 which involves the transfer of one electron. Note that ˇ is a Brönsted coefﬁcient (not necessarily identical
with ˇ) which is the symmetry factor related to the symmetry of
the energy barrier for electron transfer step 3. As seen from the
bottom of the energy well for RS−
, the barrier height changes by

−(1 − ˇ ) GRS− in the presence of adsorption, compared with its
standard state value at Â = 0.5. The rate of the r.d.s. is therefore:

The ﬁrst exponential term of the equation depends on the thermodynamics of step 2 and the second term depends on the potential

ﬁxed potential E. So the rate can be rewritten as:

The hypothetical slope (ıE◦ /ı log i)E of the rising side of the volcano is then RT/Fˇ , and if the energy barrier is symmetrical ˇ = 0.5
the slope is 2RT/F or 0.118 V/decade. Experimental values are close
to this ﬁgure.
For the falling side of the volcano, Â is high and

Again, the second exponential term is constant since E is constant. Under high coverage conditions the rate becomes zero order
in RS− so the rate in the falling side of the volcano is:

v = C exp +

1 − ˇ GRS−
RT

(12)

and the slope of the declining portion of the volcano would
be −2RT/F. Experimental values are larger (absolute value) than
−0.118 V/decade.
From this simpliﬁed analysis, catalysts on the rising and falling
side of the volcano should have the same Tafel slope, provided that
GRS− does not depend on the electrode potential (a mathematical
treatment for the case where GRS− depends on the potential as
been given elsewhere [92] and it is too long to describe here).
The numerical deduction given above predicts that ˇ should
have the same value for both branches, but Figs. 9 and 10 show that
this is not the case. However, the rising branch (weak adsorption,
positive G, low Â) may have very differently shaped energy wells
than those for the falling branch (strong adsorption, negative G,
high Â), so the change in ˇ with coverage may not be surprising.
In all cases, the rising branch of the volcanoes shows slopes almost
one-half of those corresponding to the falling branch [295].
It can be concluded that (i) ˇ (the symmetry factor for the electrochemical step) seems to depend on the nature of the catalyst
which indicates that the shape of the energy wells might vary to
some degree for each catalyst (as seen for the variation of Tafel
slopes), (ii) variations in the slopes on both sides of the volcanos
or incomplete volcanos might also reﬂect changes in the shape of
energy wells with adsorption and (iii) the rising portion of the volcano corresponds to low coverages and a maximum activity should
be achieved at Â = 0.5.
In general, the slopes observed experimentally are close to, but
less than 2RT/F (0.118 V/decade) and indicate that the formal potential of the catalyst is directly proportional to GRS− as:
GRS− ≈ −nEF ◦ + C
So replacing

and C contains all terms in the exponential that are constant. So a plot of log i, which is proportional to log v, versus E◦
would have a reciprocal slope of +2.303RT/Fˇ (assuming n = 1) or
+0.118 V/decade, for ˇ values ca. 0.5. This slope is similar to a Tafel
slope of +2.303RT/Fˇ that is obtained for kinetic measurements
with a single catalyst (E◦ constant) from plots of log i versus E. So
the rising side of a volcano essentially represents a plot of log v (or
log i) versus driving force of the catalyst (E◦ ) at constant E whereas
a Tafel plot represents a plot of log v (or log i) for a given catalyst
versus driving force of the electrode (E) at constant E◦ .
Replacing GRS− in Eq. (12), for the falling side of the volcano
we have:

(15)

2768

so the slope (ıE◦ /ı log i)E in the falling side of a volcano of log i
versus E◦ would be 2.303RT/F(1 − ˇ ) or ca. −0.118 V/decade for
ˇ = 0.5. Thus, increasing the formal potential increases the reactivity of the metal center in the macrocycle towards the thiol.
However, increasing the formal potential beyond a certain value
becomes detrimental since this stabilizes the adduct (shifting the
equilibrium of step 2 to the right), blocking the active sites. This
can explain the declining portion of the volcano plots, that includes
most of the catalysts studied. G◦ ads is >0 for the ascending portion of the volcano (low coverages Â
1). The maximum activity
should be achieved when Gads = 0 [345] and Â = 0.5 (equilibrium
constant equal to 1 for step 1 under standard conditions). Then currents decrease for values of Gads < 0 which correspond to the high
coverage region (Â ∼ 1). However an explanation is still needed for
the slopes near −4RT/F in the declining portion of the volcano, i.e.
for the unsymmetry of the experimental volcano correlations. They
might reﬂect a different shape of the energy well for high coverages
which will affect the values of ˇ .
The data in Figs. 9 and 10 clearly show that MN4 -macrocyclic
complexes with formal potentials corresponding to an optimum
situation for the interaction of the thiol with the active sites will
have the highest activity. This corresponds to the Sabatier principle in heterogeneous catalysis that an interaction of the reacting
molecule with the active sites needs to be not too weak, not
too strong for optimum catalytic activity [345–360]. For the oxidation of 2-mercaptoethanol the highest activity is observed for
E◦ = −0.93 V versus SCE for catalysts adsorbed on graphite and at
E◦ = −0.95 V versus SCE for catalysts adsorbed on glassy carbon
[295] whereas for 2-mercaptoacetate oxidation maximum activity is achieved for E◦ = −0.85 V versus SCE. For the oxidation of
aminoethanethiol, maximum activity is observed for E◦ = −1.02 V
and for cysteine E◦ = −1.01 V [344]. A plot of the pKa of the thiol
versus E◦ max gives a linear correlation, indicating once again that
the maximum in the volcano is related to the reactivity of the sulfur
in the thiol [344]. So the optimum formal potential depends on the
nature of the thiol.
4. Catalytic properties of MPc in electrochemical reduction
of molecular oxygen
Amongst the non-noble metals candidates, phthalocyanines
have appeared as promising catalysts to replace platinum in fuel
cells. Unfortunately, the stability of metallo phthalocyanines in a
fuel cell environment is tempered by the formation of oxygenbased radical intermediates that can attack the ligand during the O2
reduction process, with the generation of species that present much
lower catalytic activity than the original phthalocyanine. In this
section we will discuss the catalytic properties of metallophthalocyanines for the electrochemical reduction of molecular oxygen in
aqueous media. The different factors that affect their catalytic activity will be discussed such as the nature of the central metal, the

sites on the electrode surface.

nature of the ligand and the effect of substituents on the phthalocyanine ring. Catalytic activity of different metallomacrocyclics will
be discussed in terms of the different reduction pathways of O2 that
they promote, i.e. two versus four electron reduction pathways.
4.1. Reaction pathways for the reduction of molecular oxygen
The electrochemical reduction of oxygen in aqueous media is a
complex multielectron process that occurs via two main pathways:
one involving the transfer of two electrons, to give hydrogen peroxide and the direct four-electron pathway to give water. The latter
involves the rupture of the O–O bond and releases the most energy.
The nature of the electrode strongly inﬂuences the preferred pathway. Most electrode materials catalyze the reaction only via two
electrons to give hydrogen peroxide. The several possible pathways
are given in Table 8. In strongly alkaline solutions or in organic solvents, O2 is reduced via the transfer of a single electron to give
superoxide ion
O2 + e−

O2 − E ◦ = −0.33 V versus NHE

As mentioned above, in order to obtain the maximum free
energy or the highest oxidant capacity of O2 when this molecule
reacts on the cathode of a fuel-cell, O2 needs to be reduced via
four electrons. Most common electrode materials only promote
the two-electron pathway, which releases almost one half the free
energy compared to that of the four-electron pathway. This can be
attributed in part to the high dissociation energy of the O–O bond
(118 kcal/mol). Fig. 11 illustrates the possible orientations that O2
can adopt when it interacts with an active site. The four-electron
reduction of dioxygen to give water involves the rupture of the O–O
bond and requires the interaction of dioxygen with one site (single site, side-on, see Fig. 11) or with two active sites simultaneously
(dual site, bridge, see Fig. 11) on the electrode surface. When dioxygen interacts or binds to a site, as depicted in Fig. 11, the energy of
the O–O bond decreases, favoring the rupture of the bond since
electrons accepted by the oxygen molecule will occupy antibonding ␲* orbitals. On platinum, O2 reduction occurs almost entirely
via four electrons [361]. A “bridge cis” type of interaction is favor-

able on Pt, as illustrated in Fig. 11, which involves two metal sites
since the Pt–Pt separation in certain crystallographic orientations
is optimal for this type of interaction. It is very important then to
develop low cost catalysts that decrease the overpotential of the
reduction of oxygen and that can also promote the four-electron
reduction.
Several reviews have appeared in the literature dealing with
the electrocatalytic activity of MN4 complexes for the reduction
of dioxygen [12–14,16–19,23–25,364,365]. MN4 complexes are
also interesting because they provide models where active centers
can be identiﬁed and their catalytic activity can also be modulated by changing the structure of the macrocyclic ligand or by
changing the central metal as discussed above for the oxidation
of thiols. Fe and Mn phthalocyanines, at low overpotentials promote the four-electron reduction with rupture of the O–O bond
[14,16,18,361,366], without the formation of hydrogen peroxide.
In contrast Co, Ni and Cu phthalocyanines promote the reduction
of O2 only via two-electron to give hydrogen peroxide [16,366]
as the main product. Polymerized Co tetraamino phthalocyanines
promote the four-electron [367,368] reduction whereas polymerized Fe tetraaminophthalocyanines only promote the two-electron
reduction [310] in contrast to their monomeric counterparts.
The catalytic activity of metal macrocyclics is correlated to the
M(III)/M(II) redox potential of the complexes, the more positive
the redox potential, the higher the activity. This trend is the opposite to what is expected from a simple redox catalysis mechanism,
which is generally observed for the reduction of O2 catalyzed by
immobilized enzymes.
Most studies have been performed with the metal chelates
conﬁned on an electrode surface, generally graphite or carbon supports. Heat treatment in an inert atmosphere increases both the
stability and catalytic activity [369–374]. Since the support can act
as an axial ligand, the properties of the complexes in solution or
on the adsorbed state could be different. So most studies discussed
here have been carried out with the complexes immobilized on
graphite or carbon supports. Smooth electrodes have been used to
study mechanistic aspects of the reaction.
4.2. Interaction of O2 with active sites and the redox mechanism
O2 reduction involving more than one electron is an inner sphere
reaction and involves an interaction of dioxygen with an active
site as depicted in Fig. 11. The outer-sphere reduction of dioxygen
involves the transfer of one single electron to give superoxide and
probably occurs at the outer Helmholz plane. The kinetics of this
outer-sphere reaction are independent of the nature of the catalyst
and do not involve an interaction of dioxygen with the electrode
surface. Since we are interested in studying the electrocatalysis
of the reaction we will focus our discussion on the inner sphere
reduction mechanisms.
The interaction of molecular oxygen with the MN4 catalyst
involves binding to the d-orbitals of the central metal in the macrocyclic structure and will be inﬂuenced by the electronic density
located on those orbitals. Two different possible interactions, endon and side-on, of the orbitals of the dioxygen molecule with the
orbitals of the metal in the MN4 molecule occur, as illustrated in
Fig. 11. For end-on M–O2 complexes, the major interaction for both
␴ and ␲ bonding occurs with the ␲* antibonding orbitals of the O2 .
The ␴ interaction is essentially between the metal 3dz2 and the in
plane antibonding ␲g s orbital of dioxygen, where the superscript
refers to whether or not the orbital is symmetric “s” (or antisymmetric “a”) with respect to the MO2 plane. This can be viewed as
an electron transfer from the metal ion to O2 . The ␲ interaction
involves essentially the metal 3dyz and the 1␲g a (␲ antibonding
antisymmetric orbital) on the O2 and can be visualized as a backbonding interaction. In both interactions the ␲u s and ␲u a (bonding

␲ orbitals symmetric and antisymmetric respectively) play a lesser
role in the composition of the bonding orbitals [375–378]. For the
side-on interaction, a 3dz2 orbital of the metal will interact with the
1␲s u bonding orbital (back-bonding interaction) and a 3dxz with
a 1␲g s antibonding orbital of dioxygen. Fig. 12 shows the optimized structural conﬁgurations for the O2 adsorbed on FePc and
CoPc molecules [377].
Shi and Zhang conducted a density functional theory study of
metal phthalocyanines and metal porphyrins [379] to investigate
the dioxygen-binding abilities and their relation with the catalytic
activity. They investigated both end-on and side-on binding modes.
They also evaluated the electronic properties of the complexes such
as the ionization potential and Mulliken charge. They also studied
the effect of substituents on the ligand on the electronic properties of the complexes. The catalytic activity varied linearly with
the ionization potential. The ionization potential correlates directly
with the redox potential of the catalysts, based on previous studies by Zagal and co-workers [18,331,334,375]. Cobalt porphyrins
have high ionization potentials, which make them better catalysts
than the iron counter parts. In contrast with other phthalocyanines,
iron derivatives have large ionization potentials and better oxygenbinding ability which makes them good catalysts for O2 reduction
[379]. As discussed further down, these theoretical studies correlate well with experimental studies that demonstrate that the
redox potential (proportional to the ionization potential) is related
to the catalytic activity of metal phthalocyanines.
The active site in the phthalocyanine usually involves the M(II)
state, so in alkaline solution a step will require the reduction of
M(III):
M(III) − OH + e

M(II) + OH−

(17)

An adduct will be formed as follows:
M(II) + O2

M(III) − O2 − or M(II) − O2

(18)

2770

The adduct will undergo reduction as follows:
M(III) − O2 − + e−

M(II) + intermediates

(19)

The mechanism above is applicable to Mn and Fe complexes.
In the case of Co complexes, Co(III) is probably not formed upon
its interaction with the dioxygen molecule since the Co(III)/(II)
redox process occurs at much more positive potentials than the
Fe(III)/Fe(II) process but step 17 is still crucial since the catalytically
active site is Co(II) [14,19]. Density functional theory calculations [377,378] have indicated that O2 interacts with CoPc via
an end-on interaction whereas for FePc both end-on and sideon interactions are plausible. As it will be discussed further, Fe
phthalocyanines promote the four-electron reduction of O2 and
this can be attributed to a side-on interaction of O2 with the Fe
complexes, which facilitates the rupture of the O–O bond.
When making comparisons between different catalysts, it is
important that the redox potentials or formal potentials are measured in the same conditions. This implies that the same electrolyte
and the same pH are used since M(III)/M(II) redox couples are
pH dependent [366,379–381]. Co and Fe phthalocyanines exhibit
the highest activity for the reduction of O2 but they behave differently: Co complexes exhibit Co(III)/Co(II) transition that is far
more positive than the onset potential for O2 reduction whereas
for Fe complexes the onset potential for O2 reduction is very close
to the Fe(III)/Fe(II) process [14,18,19,366]. There is in situ spectroscopic evidence for the fact that reversible transitions for the
adsorbed macrocycles involve the M(III)/M(II) couples [19,382,383]
for both Co and Fe phthalocyanines. For example, for experiments
conducted on Fe phthalocyanine adsorbed on ordinary pyrolitic
graphite, Scherson et al. demonstrated that evidence for the redox
transition assigned to Fe(III)/Fe(II) involving a metal-based orbital
was supported by Fe K-edge XANES [382,383] (X-ray absorption
near edge structure) recorded in situ in 0.5 M H2 SO4 as illustrated
in Fig. 13. The adsorption edge of Fe(II)Pc (recorded at the same
potential indicated in the insert) shifted strongly to higher energies
upon oxidation from Fe(II) to Fe(III).
The total driving force of the reaction is given by the applied
potential and also by the M(III)/M(II) formal potential of the catalyst, so the catalytic activity could be correlated with the formal
potential of the catalyst as discussed before for the oxidation of
thiols. Many authors have discussed this issue and it is yet not
clear what sort of correlation should be expected. Reduction should
occur at the potential of reduction of the M(III)O2 − adduct and
not at the potential of the M(III)/M(II) couple. The latter should
only be observed if the reaction were outer-sphere. For the particular case of iron phthalocyanines and other macrocyclics, O2
reduction starts at potentials very close to the Fe(III)/Fe(II) couple [14,18,23]. In contrast, for cobalt macrocyclics reduction of O2
starts at potentials much more negative than those corresponding to the Co(III)/Co(II) couple [366]. Several authors have reported
correlations between activity (measured as potential at constant
current) and the M(III)/M(II) formal potential and volcano-shaped
curves have been obtained [13,366,384,385]. This could indicate
that the redox potential needs to be located in an appropriate
rather narrow window to achieve maximum activity as discussed
before for the oxidation of thiols. In other words a M(III)/M(II) formal potential that is too negative (easily oxidable metal center)
or a M(III)/M(II) formal potential that is too positive (metal center that is more difﬁcult to oxidize) does not favor the catalysis.
However more recent studies [304,331,334,375] have shown that
when comparing families of metallophthalocyanines, linear correlations are obtained when plotting log k or log I (rate constant or
current at ﬁxed potential, respectively) versus the M(III)/M(II) formal potential, as illustrated in Fig. 14A (ﬁrst order rate constants
were calculated as k = I/nAFc where I is the current at a given potential, n is the total number of electrons transferred, which is 2 for the

hydrogen peroxide pathway and 4 for the reduction to H2 O, A is the
area in cm2 , F is the Faraday constant and c is the oxygen concentration in moles per cm3 ). One linear correlation is obtained for Cr, Mn
and Fe complexes and these metals have conﬁgurations d4 (Cr), d5
(Mn) and d6 (Fe) and another linear correlation is obtained for Co
complexes, which have a d7 conﬁguration. Shi and Zhang [379] have
conducted theoretical studies that show that the ionization potential of the complexes IP is correlated the redox potential of Co and
Fe phthalocyanines and porphyrins. So the catalytic activity should
also be correlated with IP so plots of log k versus IP also give linear
correlations (see Fig. 14B and C). The lines in Fig. 14A are parallel
with a slope close to 0.15 V/decade. The line in Fig. 14B has a slope of
1.25 eV/decade and 1.1 eV/decade for Fig. 14C demonstrating that
IP is a good reactivity index for these Co and Fe phthalocyanines
and also for TPyr3,4FePz. It is possible that the declining straight
lines are part of an incomplete volcano correlation. If so, the slope
(ıE◦ /ı log i)E of 0.15 V/decade might have a physical meaning, as
discussed for the oxidation of thiols [92]. So using similar arguments to those discussed for the oxidation of thiols, the slope of
0.15 V/decade would correspond to the falling region of an incomplete volcano. If the lines in Fig. 14 correspond to a declining portion
of a volcano, then the log of currents should be used instead of log k
since the calculation of log k assumes that the surface concentration
of adsorbed reacting O2 molecules and the surface concentration of
free sites are constant and this is not necessarily true on the falling
side of a volcano. However, the shape of the curves in Fig. 14 is
not going to change when using log I since the kinetic currents are
proportional to k. For the data in Fig. 14, the driving force of the
catalyst increases as the formal potential of the catalysts becomes
more negative. So if GadsO2 is the free energy of step 18, then the
more negative the formal potential of the catalyst, the more nega-

be (note that we do not use rate constants but rates):

v = C exp +

ˇ

and since kinetic data are compared at constant E, the second exponential term is constant so Eq. (20) can be rewritten as:

(21)

so assuming that
GadsO2 ≈ nFE ◦ + C

v = C exp +

(22)
(23)

where C contains the constant exponential terms.
So Eq. (23) predicts a reciprocal slope (ıE◦ /ı log i)E of the plot
of log v versus E◦ of 2.303RT/Fˇ , which for values of ˇ = 0.5 gives
a slope of 0.118 V/decade. This is not far from the experimental
values.
The data in Fig. 14A indicate that more positive redox potentials will increase the catalytic activity up to a certain point if
the correlation is an “incomplete volcano”. The M(III)/M(II) redox
potential of some macrocyclics can be shifted in the positive direction with heat-treatment. For example when iron tetraphenyl
porphyrin [372], 4(Ph)FeP, is heat treated the Fe(III)/(II) redox transition is shifted from 0.2 V versus RHE for fresh 4(Ph)FeP to 0.4 V for
4(Ph)FeP heat treated at 700 ◦ C. Intermediate redox potentials are
obtained for heat treatments at intermediate temperatures [372]

and the catalytic activity increases with heat treatment, showing
that a more positive redox potential of the catalyst favors the O2
reduction reaction rate.
An alternative explanation for the results in Fig. 14 (activity
decreases as the driving force of the catalyst increases) is that
the electronic coupling between the donor (MPc) and the acceptor
(O2 ) decreases as the electron-donating capacity of the substituents
increases, due to a shift in the energy of the frontier orbitals of the
metallophthalocyanine [332,386,387]. The shift in the energy of the
frontier orbital with substituents on cobalt phthalocyanines has
been calculated by Schlettwein and Yoshida [332] and CárdenasJirón and co-workers [296] using PM3 and ZINDO/S semi-empirical
theoretical calculations and using DFT by Shi and Zhang [379]. There
are several approaches to estimate the electronic coupling matrix
elements between the donor and the acceptor in electron transfer
reactions. One of them considers the energy difference between the
LUMO of the electron acceptor and the HOMO of the electron donor
[388] but this requires knowledge of the distance that separates the
donor from the acceptor. This is not simple for an inner sphere reaction where the M–O2 distance could vary from complex to complex.
Another reactivity index that can be used to rationalize the data in
Fig. 14 is the concept of molecular hardness which is a commonly
used criterion to predict reactivities in organic reactions and was
proposed by Pearson [389,390]. The hardness Á of a single molecule
is approximately one-half the energy gap of the HOMO–LUMO, so
the larger the gap the greater the hardness of the molecule and the
higher its stability (the harder the molecule the lower its reactivity).
On the contrary, a molecule with a narrow HOMO–LUMO gap (soft
molecule) will be very reactive. Now for a donor–acceptor pair it
is better to use the concept of donor–acceptor hardness ÁDA which
is one-half the difference between the energy of the LUMO of the

acceptor (O2 molecule) and the energy of the HOMO of the donor
(metal complex).

ÁDA = − (εLUMOacceptor − εHOMOdonor )

(24)

Also, the donor–acceptor intermolecular hardness is one half the
difference between the ionization potential of the donor and the
electron afﬁnity of the acceptor.

ÁDA = − (Idonor − Aacceptor )
2

(25)

The ionization potential is directly proportional to the redox
potential of the catalyst as shown in theoretical studies by Shi and
Zhang [379]. For a gas phase reaction involving the transfer of a
single electron this will be equivalent to G◦ . For the particular
case of Co-phthalocyanine in its ground state, the highest occupied
molecular orbital is occupied with a single electron (doublet state)
so it corresponds to a single occupied molecular orbital (SOMO). The
same is valid for molecular oxygen, which in its ground state has
two unpaired electrons in two degenerate ␲* anti-bonding orbitals.
So the formation of an adduct CoPc–O2 involves the interaction of
two SOMOs and ÁDA is given by:
ÁDA =

1
(ε
− εSOMO/donor )
2 SOMO/acceptor

(26)

Fig. 15 illustrates the calculated energy levels of the SOMOs
of different cobalt phthalocyanines with respect to the SOMO
of dioxygen using PM3. Electron-withdrawing substituents (sulfonate, ﬂuoro) on the phthalocyanine ring stabilize the SOMO
and the opposite is true for electron donating groups (methoxy
and neopentoxy). So electron-withdrawing groups, even though
they decrease the electron density on the cobalt (more positive

redox potential) they also decrease the gap between the energy
of the SOMO of the phthalocyanine and the energy of the SOMO
of dioxygen. The bottom of Fig. 15 shows that log k for O2 reduction increases as the chemical hardness of the system decreases or
as the softness of the system increases the reactivity increases. The
trend in reactivity is exactly the same as that illustrated in Fig. 14. So
molecular hardness can be used as a criterion for reactivity of these
systems when comparing complexes that bear the same structure,
and could explain why, for example perﬂuorinated phthalocyanine,
which has the most positive redox potential (the most oxidant) is
the best catalyst for O2 reduction in the series of cobalt phthalocyanines examined since one would expect, on thermodynamic
grounds that the best catalyst should be that one having the most
negative redox potential. However, the concepts discussed before
need to be taken with care since the metal-free phthalocyanine
molecule (∼1.8 eV HOMO–LUMO energy gap, which is quite small)
is not very reactive and rather stable. It would be interesting to use
the Klopman–Salem equation to describe the reactivity of the one
system with respect to the other one. According to this equation
a hard-hard reaction is fast because of a large Coulombic attraction and a soft–soft reaction is fast because of a large interaction
between the HOMO of the nucleophile and the LUMO of the electrophile. To the best of our knowledge, there no reports in the
literature that use the Klopman–Salem equation to describe the
reactivity of phthalocyanines
In order to understand the dioxygen-binding difference
between phthalocyanines and porphyrins, with cobalt and iron as
central metals, Shi and Zhang [379] examined electronic structures
using density functional theory. They calculated Mulliken charges
on central atoms of metal macrocyclic complexes. They ﬁnd that
electron-withdrawing substituents (HSO3 , F) of M-X-Pc increase
as expected the positive charge on both central metal atoms (Co
and Fe), and electron-donating substituents (methoxy, neopentoxy,
phenyl) diminish the charge on central metal atoms (Co and Fe). For
phthalocyanine systems, they ﬁnd that the central metal has less
charge compared to porphyrins. They attribute this to the better
electron-donating ability of the phthalocyanine ligand compared
to the porphyrin one, that has a frontier orbital (HOMO) of lower
energy and higher ionization potential than that of Pc. The calculated charges on Co in phthalocyanine and porphyrin systems are
in the range of 0.18–0.21 and 0.24–0.26, respectively. For Fe, they
are in the range of 0.31– 0.40 and 0.43–0.45, respectively. They ﬁnd
that the Co atom generally has a small Mulliken charge than the corresponding Fe atom due to lower d orbital energies of cobalt. The
HOMO energies calculated for CoPcs were lower than that of molecular oxygen (except for 8␤(OCH3 )CoPc, which has a higher HOMO
energy). The 3d orbitals of Co in CoPcs were even lower in energy.
An electron-donating substituent has the effect of raising the Co 3d
orbital energy, the energy gap between the interaction orbitals of
Co and O2 diminishes, so the binding energy increases. This disagrees with the explanation given by Zagal and Cardenas-Jirón
[386] that stated that the electronic coupling between the donor
(CoPcs) and the acceptor (O2 ) decreases as the electron-donating
capability of the substituents increases. Shi and Zhang obtained a
theoretical correlation very similar to that illustrated in Fig. 14 B
and C, where they plot experimental values of log k versus the ionization potential IP. They conclude [379] that the catalytic activity
of the metal-macrocyclics is related to its ionization potential and
dioxygen-binding ability.
For substituted cobalt phthalocyanines, the catalytic activity
decreases linearly with dioxygen binding ability so for cobalt
phthalocyanines the activity is associated with weak dioxygen
binding ability. For Fe complexes they claim [379] that the reverse
is true but the dispersion of the data does not allow to draw
this conclusion. However the clear correlation obtained with Co
phthalocyanines strongly suggest that the data in Fig. 14A corre-

sponds to the falling region of an incomplete volcano since the
decrease in the activity with driving force is associated with strong
adsorption of O2 on the Co sites. These authors explain the differences in reactivity between phthalocyanines and porphyrins.
Cobalt porphyrins have high ionization potentials, making them
better catalysts than the corresponding iron derivatives. In contrast, for phthalocyanines, iron complexes have large ionization
potentials and better dioxygen-binding ability, which make them
better catalysts than Co derivatives. Therefore, their calculations
[379] predict very well the catalytic activities found experimentally in spite of the fact that the inﬂuence of the solvent has not
been considered.
Quantum theories of elementary heterogeneous electron transfer (ET) reactions in polar media have been extended to reactions
which proceed through active intermediate electronic surface band
states or bands. On the basis of this theoretical framework Ulstrup
[391] has interpreted experimental data obtained for the reduction
of molecular oxygen catalyzed by metal phthalocyanines. When
comparing activities of complexes by plotting constant potential
versus redox potential of the catalyst, linear correlations are also
obtained (see Fig. 16) as predicted theoretically [391]. Essentially,
Fig. 16 is a plot of driving force versus driving force. This carries
the assumption that the M(III)/M(II) redox potential provides a

measure of the driving force of the catalysts and this might not
necessarily be true for inner sphere reactions.
Not all metals of the ﬁrst transition series exhibit M(III)/M(II)
processes so if one compares macrocyclics of different metals it is
convenient to use another parameter, for example the number of
d electrons in the metal (Fig. 17). Here it can be clearly seen that
Fe derivatives exhibit the highest activity, followed by Mn and Co
and the correlation also illustrates a common observation in catalysis that metals with nearly half ﬁlled d-energy levels exhibit the
highest activity. So a redox type of mechanism does not operate for
metals that do not exhibit the M(III)/M(II) transition in the potential window examined for O2 reduction. This is the case for Ni, Cu
and Zn phthalocyanines. It is important to comment at this point
that in order to obtain catalytic activity, the frontier orbital of the
MN4 needs to have some d character. In fact, the most active catalysts included in the data (Cr, Mn, Fe, Co) have frontier orbitals
with d character [392]. In the case of CuPc, Fig. 18 [334] compares
the frontier orbitals of CoPc and CuPc and it is quite clear that CoPc
shows a well deﬁned dz2 orbital sticking out of the plane of the
phthalocyanine whereas CuPc does not and shows very low activity for O2 reduction. There is experimental evidence to support this

was completely evaporated, only 30% of the amount deposited
was electrochemically active. Finally, van der Putten et al. [402]
have observed catalytic activity with vacuum deposited layers in
spite of the fact that these layers are electrochemically silent. As
pointed out before when multilayers of metal phthalocyanines are
deposited on an electrode surface, only the outermost layer is active
for the reduction of O2 [402] and this is also true for other electrochemical reactions. This shows that multilayers of phthalocyanines
or polymerized multilayers of phthalocyanines are rather compact
and the inner layers are not accessible to O2 molecules [368].

molecular oxygen

using tunneling electron microscopy. By this technique Hipps et
al. [393] have been shown a strong d-orbital dependence on the
images of metal phthalocyanines (see Fig. 19). Unlike CuPc where
the metal appears as a hole in the molecular image, CoPc shows the
highest point in the molecular image [393]. The benzene regions of
CoPc and CuPc show the same height. So, essentially images are in
agreement with those predicted by theoretical calculations.
Even though most authors agree that the M(II) state is the active
site for O2 reduction [13,17–19,23,25,370,376,378,379,383], it has
been proposed that Fe(I) could also play a role in the electrocatalytic process in the case of FePc and FeNc [394–396]. This was
based on electroreﬂectance experiments that indicated that Fe(I)
interacts with O2 whereas Fe(II) does not. However, many authors
have shown experimental evidence that O2 reduction commences
at potentials much more positive that those corresponding to the
Fe(II)/Fe(I) [14,16–19,366]. On the contrary, the reduction currents
are observed at potentials close to the potential of the Fe(III)/Fe(II)
couple, so it seems unlikely that Fe(I) could be the active site. Worse,
as shown from rotating ring-disk experiments, Fe(I) only favors the
2 electron reduction in contrast to Fe(II) [14,370,397] so catalytic
activity when scanning the potential in the negative direction with
electrodes containing FePcs decreases as Fe(I) is formed.
Another factor that affects the catalytic activity is the amount
of metal complex present on the electrode surface. In general, this
is evaluated from cyclic voltammograms, measuring the electrical
charge under reversible peaks. This carries the assumption that all
adsorbed catalyst gives an electrochemical signal. This might not
necessary be true and there could be a fraction of complexes present
on the surface that are electrochemically silent. It is assumed that
the “electroactive” adsorbed species are also active for the reduction of O2 . O2 reduction currents are directly proportional to the
amount of catalyst [398,399], when the catalysts is adsorbed on
the electrode surface indicating that the reaction is ﬁrst order in
the surface concentration of catalyst. This was not true for cases
where the catalyst is incorporated to the surface by vapor deposition or when the catalyst is deposited from solutions and the
solvent is completely evaporated [399]. This can be explained by
the formation of multilayers where the metal active centers are
not all completely accessible to O2 . This is also the case for polymerized multilayers of 4␤(NH2 )CoPc, where it has been shown
that only the outermost layer was active for the reduction of O2
[367,368]. Scherson and co-workers have also reported that when
(4Ph(OCH3 )FeP))2 O is deposited on a porous support, 30% of the
amount deposited is electrochemically active [400] and Anson and
co-workers [401] have found that for 16(CN)CoPc and 16(F)CoPc
complexes that were deposited from solutions where the solvent

Practically all reports on the catalytic reduction of O2 on
metallomacrocyclics in aqueous media have shown that the overall reaction involves two or four electron pathways or mixtures,
depending on the nature of the central metal ion but to best of
our knowledge there is only one report that shows evidence for
the one-electron reduction of O2 in alkaline media. A reversible
one-electron reduction of O2 to produce the stable superoxide ion
was observed in an aqueous solution of 1 M NaOH. This process
was catalyzed by 16(F)CoPc adsorbed on a graphite electrode [403].
The OH− concentration has a very strong effect on the reduction
process. Higher OH− concentration could stabilize the superoxide
ion [24]. What is curious is that 16(F)CoII Pc is the most active
catalyst for the two-electron reduction of O2 in the correlations
in Figs. 14, 16 and 17 so it is surprising that this catalyst is also
active for the one-electron reduction of O2 , which is though to be
an outer-sphere reaction.
4.4. Two to four-electron reduction catalysts for the reduction of
molecular oxygen
Most mono-nuclear Co phthalocyanines catalyze the
reduction of dioxygen via two electrons to give peroxide
[13,14,16–19,23,361,397]. The activity of iron phthalocyanines in
general is higher than those of cobalt phthalocyanines and the
opposite is true for porphyrins, which reveals the importance
of the nature of the ligand in determining the catalytic activity
[27,404]. Theoretical calculations by Shi and Zhang corroborate
this [379]. The opposite is observed for heat-treated materials
[364,404]. Cobalt complexes are more stable than iron complexes
and this trend is maintained after heat-treatment [405]. However,
iron complexes tend to promote the four-electron reduction of
dioxygen and this will be discussed further on.
Spectroscopic investigations of polymer-modiﬁed electrodes
containing 4␤(SO3 − )CoPc using UV–visible differential reﬂectance
spectroscopy allowed identifying Co(III)/Co(II) transition when
varying the electrode potential [406,407]. Electron spin resonance
on the Ppy (polypyrrole) and Ppy-4␤(SO3 − )CoPc coated electrodes
in deoxygenated and oxygen saturated solutions showed that the
4␤(SO3 − )Co(III)Pc species is effective in the electroreduction of
oxygen and that this species is more stable in oxygen saturated
medium than in deoxygenated medium because of its stabilization under Co(III)(O2 form. In the case of Ppy-4␤(SO3 − )CoPc ﬁlm,
the polypyrrole matrix undergoes strong interactions with oxygen
species, and most likely, with hydrogen peroxide.
Phosphoric acid is one of the electrolytes used in fuel cells and
very few reports have focused their attention on the activity of
metallo macrocyclics in this electrolyte (without heat treatment).
Phougat and Vasudevan [408] investigated the electrocatalytic
activity of cobalt monophthalocyanines and polymers with imido
and carboxylic group ends. The complexes were mixed with carbon
powder and polyethylene powder. The activity of the monomeric
compounds was higher than that of polymeric compounds.

Elzing et al. have proposed [409] that the presence of a basic

dioxygen:

In order to verify if 4␤(SO3 − )CoPc is active for the electroreduction of hydrogen peroxide a study was conducted on adsorbed
mixtures of 4␤(SO3 − )CoPc and 4␤(SO3 − )FePc on graphite in different proportions. As 4␤(SO3 − )CoPc catalyzes the reduction of
O2 only to hydrogen peroxide, if 4␤(SO3 − )FePc had any catalytic
activity it would reduce the hydrogen peroxide generated on the
4␤(SO3 − )CoPc sites. However this was not observed and both
catalysts behave independently [410]. The amount of hydrogen
peroxide generated was inversely proportional to the fraction of
4␤(SO3 − )FePc present on the surface (see Fig. 20). In spite of these
results, it is possible for the Fe centers to form hydrogen peroxide
and promote its decomposition since Fe(II) sites are known for their
catalase activity [411]. Indeed for some metal chelates van Veen and
van Baar have shown that their catalytic activity for hydrogen peroxide decomposition is directly proportional to their activity for O2
reduction [412].
It was suggested for FePc and 4␤(SO3 − )FePc that dioxygen can
bind to the Fe center and to a highly electronegative nitrogens in the
ring, which will avoid the desorption of hydrogen peroxide before it
is reduced [241,369,410,413]. This dual site mechanism would aid
charge injection via back-bonding from the macrocycle into antibonding orbitals of O2 or bound hydrogen peroxide, causing the
destabilization and further rupture of the O–O bond [414]. At more
negative potentials at which reduction of the ligand takes place, this
mechanism becomes inoperative; the O2 molecule only binds to the
Fe center and hydrogen peroxide can desorb into the solution. In a
study involving heat treated 4(Ph)FeP [415] and deposited by thick
layers on glassy carbon, the amount of hydrogen peroxide decomposed, compared to the amount of oxygen and hydrogen peroxide
reduced, was so small that chemical decomposition was ruled out.
van den Brink et al. [413] have found that for vacuum deposited
layers of FePc the ﬁrst reduction wave scan was very different
from subsequent scans, indicating that some reorganization of the
deposited layers took place (this phenomenon is not observed on

adsorbed layers of FePc). The effect of irreversible changes of FePc
when treated under potential load with oxygen is only observed
using vacuum deposited multilayers [394]. Léger and co-workers
[414] have shown that the structure of FePc ﬁlms affects their
electrocatalytic activity. XRD studies have suggested that non-heat
treated FePc is under the ␣-phase whereas heat-treated FePc is
under the ␤-phase. Surprisingly, the ␣-phase shows higher activity
than the ␤-phase (see Fig. 21). These authors have also shown using
electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) technique
that the ␣-phase FePc probably forms ␮-oxo dimers at potentials
higher than 700 mV versus RHE. These ␮-oxo dimers are reduced
at the same potential as the monomer of ␣-phase FePc [414].
Carbon supported iridium porphyrins are the only known
mono-metal chelates that catalyze the direct four-electron reduction of O2 in acid [415–418]. van Veen and co-workers [417] have
report that the support affects the O2 reduction selectivity. They
used in situ Raman spectroscopy at adsorbed layers of iridiumoctaethylporphyrin (4(C2 H5 )IrP), iridium-tetraphenylporphyrin
(4(Ph)IrP) and iridium phthalocyanine (IrPc). Raman spectra suggested that on both substrates, the molecules lie ﬂat on the
electrode surface. For 4(C2 H5 )IrP and 4(Ph)IrP adsorbed on gold,
reduction of O2 gives only peroxide. However, for the same porphyrins adsorbed on pyrolytic graphite a four-electron reduction
is observed. On both supports a peculiar, reversible deactivation
is observed at low overpotentials. In contrast IrPc gives peroxide
on both substrates and no deactivation. The oxygen reduction on
iridium sites can be explained with a single site mechanism, taking
into account redox transitions. Ir is thought to be active only in its II
and III valence states, but inactive in its IV and I valence states. This
is similar to the O2 reduction mechanism on FePc and derivatives
where the active site seems to be Fe in its II valence state. The III
and I states in Fe phthalocyanines are inactive. The position of the
iridium affects whether oxygen–oxygen bond cleavage is possible.
For the out-of-plane iridium in porphyrins side on adsorption of
oxygen occurs and its reduction gives water as the reduction product. In contrast, for the in-plane iridium in phthalocyanines (D4h
symmetry shown by Raman spectroscopy) only end-on adsorption
of oxygen occurs, which leads to the peroxide reduction route. The
Raman studies carried out by van Veen and co-workers [417] are
consistent with the above observations but not necessarily conclusive. Since the nature of the adsorption of oxygen (side on, four
electrons, water ﬁnal product versus end-on two electrons, peroxide ﬁnal product) seems to be extremely important in dictating the
reduction mechanism, which, once again, is of crucial importance
in fuel cells applications, some theoretical studies have been carried

2776

out by several authors in an effort to predict the type of interaction
of the dioxygen molecule with an active site in a macrocyclic.
Anderson and Sidik [419] have carried out theoretical studies
using spin-unrestricted hybrid gradient-corrected density functional calculations that have predicted that Fe(II) is the active site
for four-electron reduction of oxygen by iron in the FeN4 systems. The calculations have suggested that Fe(II) is favored over
Fe(III) because H2 O bonds strongly to the Fe(III) site, preventing
O2 adsorption and water does not bond strongly to Fe(II). On the
ﬁrst step, –OOH binds more strongly to Fe(II) than to Fe(III), which
results in a more reversible potential for its formation over Fe(II).
Calculations indicate that subsequent reduction steps have very
reversible potentials over both centers (Fe(II) or Fe(III)). Calculations also show a hydrogen bonding interaction between –(OHOH)
bonded to Fe(II) and to a nitrogen lone-pair orbital in the N4
chelate. This interaction prevents peroxide from desorbing as a
two-electron reduction product. So essentially these studies show
that adsorbed hydrogen peroxide is an intermediate formed from
FeN4–OOH on Fe(II) sites and can be released into the solution at
more negative potentials as found experimentally [366,413].
Phthalocyanines containing Fe and Co as metal centers are
the most studied complexes. However, complexes of other metals have also been investigated. For example 4␤(SO3 − )CrPc and
4␤(SO3 − )MnPc were investigated [366] and they resemble somehow the behavior of Fe complexes, mainly 4␤(SO3 − )MnPc in the
sense that it shows a pre-wave where O2 reduction proceeds
entirely via four electrons to give water. Hydrogen peroxide was
formed only at higher polarizations. The low activity of Cr and Mn
can be attributed to their low redox potential, i.e. they are easily oxidized [14,385]. Most macrocyclic metal complexes increase their
activity after heat treatment [361]. However, for manganese complexes heat treatment decreases their activity probably because the
metal is lost from the N4 structure.
Complexes of Mo can only be used in alkaline solution since they
are not stable in acid. MoNc shows less catalytic activity than FeNc
[420].
In spite of the signiﬁcant amount of work carried with metallophthalocyanines on the oxygen reduction reaction, the effect
of temperature on the catalytic process has only been studied by
very few authors [421]. Studies at temperatures well above room
temperature in an acidic electrolyte are important in order to simulate the environment of an operating PEM fuel cell. Wilkinson
and co-workers [421] have conducted experiments in the temperature range of 20–80 ◦ C and using unsubstituted and substituted Fe
phthalocyanines. The surface electrochemical responses of the FePc
species were characterized with respect to their surface concentrations and adsorbed surface orientations. Depending on the type of
substituent, the adsorption mode could be ﬂat, edge-on, as a dimer,
or as agglomerate, suggesting that the substituent has a strong
effect on the FePc species’ adsorption mode. Substitution also has a
signiﬁcant effect on stability. Of the four iron phthalocynine species
tested, 16(F)FePc was the most stable in an acidic environment.
With respect to their electrocatalytic activity, temperature, substitution and possibly mode of adsorption can signiﬁcantly affect the
mechanism. For example, the overall electron transfer number “n”
observed can change from 1 to 3 depending on the type of substituent and the reaction temperature. Further research is required
to determine if this change in n reﬂects a change in the reduction
pathway, and/or a decrease in the stability of the adsorbed intermediates. Based on their experimental results, the various approaches
found in the literature, and the current understanding, a mechanism was suggested as follows:
FeIII Pc + e−

FeII Pc

(28)

FeII Pc + O2

O2 –FeII Pc

(29)

O2 –FeII Pc + e− + H+

[HO2 –FeIII Pc] (r.d.s.)

(30)

[HO2 –FeIII Pc] → HO2 •− + FeIII Pc (hydroperoxyl radical formation)
(31)
[HO2 –FeIII Pc] + e− + H+
→ H2 O2 + FeIII Pc (hydrogen peroxide formation)

(32)

[HO2 –FeIII Pc] + 3e− + 3H+ → 2H2 O + FeIII Pc (water formation)
(33)
Wilkinson and co-workers [422] have also conducted studies at
different temperatures using a Fe ﬂuoroporphyrin and essentially
found results similar to those obtained with FePc.
In conclusion, it can be said that in spite of the considerable
amount of work published in the literature, there are still many
questions that remain unsolved about the electrocatalytic reduction of O2 mediated by metallo macrocyclics conﬁned on electrode
surfaces. However some clear trends do exist. It is now well
established that Fe and Co macrocyclic complexes are by far the
best catalysts for oxygen reduction even though recent studies
suggested that co-facial Ir complexes are also very active. These
complexes are characterized by exhibiting a reversible redox
transition involving the M(III)/M(II) couple. Some authors have
reported volcano-shaped correlations between activity (measured
as current at constant potential or potential at constant current)
versus M(III)/M(II) formal potential of the catalyst suggesting that
an optimal M(III)/M(II) redox potential does exist for maximum
activity. However other authors have shown only linear correlations between activity and M(III)/M(II) redox potential, which
indicates that the more positive the redox potential the higher
the activity. In the latter correlations the activity decreases with
increasing the driving force of the catalyst. This ﬁnding is important since a priori one would expect that the more negative the
M(III)/M(II) formal potential the higher the activity, since this could
favor the partial reduction of O2 upon interacting with the metal
center, i.e. M(III)–O2 − . It is also possible that the linear correlations
found are part of an “incomplete volcano”. However, in these correlations Cr, Mn, Fe and Co complexes, which exhibit a M(III)/M(II)
transition give rise to two separated correlations or families of compounds. This is a reﬂection of the fact that the wave for O2 reduction
on for example Mn and Fe complexes starts at a potential very close
to the M(III)/M(II) formal potential of the catalyst. In contrast, for
Co-macrocyclics, the reduction wave starts at potentials far more
negative that the Co(III)/Co(II) formal potentials. The proximity of
the O2 reduction wave to the M(III)/M(II) for some complexes is also
reﬂected in the observation that a direct four-electron reduction
process operates, as observed for Fe and Mn complexes. For most
monomeric or monolayers of Co complexes the onset for O2 reduction is far removed from the Co(III)/Co(II) transition and only the
hydrogen peroxide pathway is observed. Ir porphyrins promote the
four-electron reduction of O2 in acid whereas Ir phthalocyanines
only promote the two-electron reduction pathway.
Finally some of the advantages of MN4 macrocyclics over Pt
catalysts is their tolerance to methanol cross over [16], which is
a very critical problem in methanol–air fuel cells [361]. When
methanol crossover from the anode through the electrolytic membrane to the cathode occurs, electroreduction of dioxygen and
electrooxidation of methanol occur simultaneously and this is
detrimental to the overall performance of the fuel cell. FePc
and CoPc are highly tolerant to methanol [423,424] and in general MN4 macrocyclics are poor catalysts for the oxidation of
methanol.

5. Catalytic properties of MPcs in electrochemical oxidation
of nitric oxide NO
The design of modiﬁed electrode surfaces using metal complexes is very attractive for the electrochemical activation and
measurement of nitric oxide NO in biological systems and/or models. Indeed, this is very difﬁcult because of the low concentration
and ﬂeeting existence of NO, and the need to monitor in situ its
release (in the submicromolar concentration range) has stimulated
research in this area [425]. Surface electrode modiﬁcation is needed
to make it sensitive and selective for NO. Among the widely used
catalysts, planar macrocyclic metal complexes such as porphyrin
[426–430], phthalocyanine [113,116,431–436], vitamin B12 [437]
and related complexes [438] have been reported in the last few
years. Table 9 recapitulates some signiﬁcant examples of MPcs used
for the electro-activation of NO.
In a recent work [436] using surface bound non-substituted
MPcs, the reactivity for NO oxidation follows the trend:
NiPc > ZnPc > FePc > MnPc > CrPc > CoPc > CuPc
The trend was found by studying the evolution of the kinetic
current intensity versus NO concentration [436]. Fig. 22 illustrates
the dependence of the kinetic currents Ik , calculated at E = 0.82 V
versus SCE, versus the redox potential of the catalyst. Two rather
linear correlations are established: the ﬁrst one is by using the
potential values of the redox process that appears closer to the
potential range where the oxidation of NO takes place (and noted
as E1 ) and the second one by using the potential value of the redox
process that appears at far more negative potentials compared
to that where the oxidation of NO takes place (and noted as E2 ).

E2 could involve Cr(II)-Pc(-2)/Cr(I)-Pc(-2), Mn(II)Pc(-2)/Mn(I)Pc(2), Fe(II)Pc(-2)/Fe(I)Pc(-2), Co(II)Pc(-2)/Co(I)Pc(-2), and probably
Ni(II)Pc(-2)/Ni(II)Pc(-3), Cu(II)Pc(-2)/Cu(II)Pc(-3) and Zn(II)Pc(2)/Zn(II)Pc(-3) redox processes [21,433,434]. To a certain degree,
these results agree with the previously reported trend observed
by Vilakasi and Nyokong [116] using MPcs deposited on carbon
microﬁbers (Fe > Ni > ∼
= Co > Mn > Zn > Cu).
The effects of substituents on the periphery of the macrocycle
ligand were also explored and discussed in terms of electron
density located on the metal center and correlated with the formal
potential of the corresponding involved redox couples. Tafel plots
(with currents corrected for mass-transport) for the oxidation of NO
on vitreous carbon modiﬁed electrode with adsorbed different substituted NiPcs showed that the activity of the considered complexes
is affected by the presence of different groups on the periphery
of the phthalocyanine ring. It decreases as follows: 4␤(SO3 − )NiPc
> NiPc > 4␤(NH2 )NiPc > 4␤(OPhC(CH3 )2 Ph)NiPc > 4␤(OPh)NiPc > 4␤
(NO2 )NiPc > NiNc. In other words, electron-withdrawing groups
like –SO3 − (in 4␤(SO3 − )NiPc) increase the rate of the reaction
compared to electron-donating groups, such as the butoxy moiety
in 8␣(OBu)NiPc. It was also noticed that the plot of log of the
kinetic current, at constant potential, versus the redox potential
of Ni phthalocyanines is linear, with a negative slope indicating
that the activity of the adsorbed complex decreases as the redox
potential becomes more positive.
The way the NO molecule interacts with the NiPcs is not fully
established. It is plausible that NO interacts with the metal center as suggested by Bettelheim and co-workers [439] in the case of
4␤(SO3 − )NiPc dissolved in aqueous solution, or with other macrocyclic Ni complexes [440]. So electron-withdrawing groups could

2778

center should be considered since the NO oxidation waves for these
particular complexes occur at potentials more positive than the
[M(III)Rn Pc(-2)]+ /[M(II)Rn Pc(-2)] redox process. So the following
reaction scheme can be proposed:
[M(III)R n Pc(-2)]+ + e−

M(II)R n Pc(-2)
+

[M(III)R n Pc(-2)] + NO

is liberated,

[M(III)R n Pc(-2)] + NO + e

followed by the rate determining step 41 where
after the transfer of a single electron:

(40)

+

[M(III)Rn Pc(-2)ı− − (NO)ı+ ] −→[M(III)Rn Pc(-2)]+ + NO+ + e−
r.d.s.

(41)
In these cases, one might argue that a low Tafel slope should be
observed (0.040 V/decade for a symmetry factor equal to 0.5) since
the rate determining step 41 is preceded by the fast one-electron
transfer step 39. However, the potentials at which the NO oxidation
currents are observed are more positive than the formal potential of the corresponding [M(III)Rn Pc(-2)]+ /[M(II)Rn Pc(-2)] couple.
So the electrode surface is practically covered by [M(III)Rn Pc(-2)]+
species at a concentration, for a given potential, that can be written
according to the Nernst equation (applied to adsorbed species). If
[MRn Pc]ads is the total initial surface concentration of the complex,
then:
[M(III)Rn Pc(-2)]+
ads = [MRn Pc]ads Â

0<Â<1

[M(II)Rn Pc(-2)M]ads = [MRn Pc]ads (1 − Â).

(42)
(43)

Applying the Nernst equation and assuming ideal behavior of the
adsorbed species give:
Fig. 22. (A) Plot of log Ik (at E = 0.82 V) versus the most positive redox potential of
the MPc, noted E1 . (B) Plot of log Ik (at E = 0.82 V) versus the most negative redox

decrease the electron density on the Ni center and this will favor
the oxidation of NO in the ﬁrst step. From the kinetic analysis and
from evidence provided in the literature, the following reaction
scheme for NO electrocatalytic oxidation by adsorbed NiPcs can
be proposed (Rn represents the n substituents on the phthalocyanine ligand). The symbol ı− denotes a partial increase in electron
density on the complex not necessarily located on the metal center:

where E is the applied potential and E◦ is the formal potential of the [M(III)Rn Pc(-2)]+ /[M(II)Rn Pc(-2)] couple. So, it
can be easily demonstrated that as (E − E◦ RT/F, Â → 1, i.e.
[M(III)Rn Pc(-2)]+ads → [MRn Pc(-2)]ads and [M(II)Rn Pc(-2)]ads → 0.
The rate of the reaction expressed as a current would be:

(46)

where k41 is the rate constant of step 41, Á is the overpotential
of step 41, n the total number of electrons transferred and A the

adduct surface concentration is then:

[N(II)Rn Pc(-2)ı− − (NO)ı+ ]−→Ni(II)Rn Pc(-2) + NO+ + e−

(35)

NO+ + H2 O → HNO2 + H+

(36)

[M(III)Rn Pc(-2)ı− − (NO)ı+ ]ads = K34 [M(III)Rn Pc(-2)]ads CNO

(37)

where K34 is the equilibrium constant for step 34 and CNO is the
concentration of NO. Finally, the rate expression can be written as:

rds

HNO2

NO2 − + H+

NO2 − + H2 O → NO3 − + 2H+ + 2e−

(38)

From experiments conducted by Bettelheim and co-workers
[439] in 0.05 M Na2 HPO4 aqueous solutions (pH 9) containing
4␤(SO3 − )NiPc, these authors suggested the formation of an adduct
involving the Ni(III) state, i.e. [Ni(III)Rn Pc(-2)-(NO− )] with an equilibrium constant of ca. 2.7 × 105 M−1 . However, one should be
reluctant to write a mechanism involving this adduct since it seems
unlikely that a NO− species could be formed at the high potentials at
which oxidation currents are observed. Step 35 would be rate controlling and this agrees with the Tafel slopes of ca. 0.11 V/decade
reported for the oxidation of NO on the NiPcs.
Different adducts could be formed between NO and MPcs
depending on the nature of the central metal. For example, in the
case of CrPc, MnPc, CoPc and Fe–Pc, a step involving the M(III) metal

+

Ik = nFAk41 K34 [M(III)Rn Pc(-2)]ads CNO exp

˛ÁF
RT

(47)

(48)

and then, for ˛ ≈ 0.5, the Tafel slope is ≈2.303 × 2RT/F or
0.12 V/decade.
It is interesting to note from Eq. (48) that the rates of NO oxidation for each particular catalyst would be controlled by both the
rate constant k41 of the rate determining step and the equilibrium
constant K34 for adduct formation. Electron-withdrawing groups
will favor K (since they will stabilize a more negatively charged
complex) and electron-donating groups will favor k (since they will
stabilize a more positively charged complex). This should be valid if
adduct formation implies partial transfer of electron density from
the NO molecule to the metallophthalocyanine.

J.H. Zagal et al. / Coordination Chemistry Reviews 254 (2010) 2755–2791

So the role of the metal complexes is simply to bind the NO with
probably partial charge transfer from NO to the MPc. This facilitates
the electron transfer from the electrode to the bound NO molecule
to form NO+ which undergoes further oxidation steps to ﬁnally give
nitrate ions. In fact metal-free phthalocyanine (H2 Pc) adsorbed on
vitreous carbon exhibits very little catalytic activity for NO oxidation. Finally, one can notice that Eq. (48) would also apply for
phthalocyanines with no redox activity centered on the metal, but
replacing [M(III)Rn Pc(-2)]+ by [M(II)Rn Pc(-2)].
In the case of CuPcs, the trend in activity increases as follows:
4␤(NH2 )CuPc > 4␤(NO2 )CuPc > 8␣(OBu)CuPc > TPyr3,4CuPz > 4␤
(SO3 − )CuPc > 16(F)CuPc. Contrary to what is observed for the
nickel derivatives, the activity decreases with an increase of
the electron-withdrawing power of the substituents. In this case
electron-withdrawing groups like –SO3 − and –F have a detrimental
effect in the activity of the Cu based phthalocyanines. This may
be explained by the fact that the effect of substituents has a more
profound effect on the rate constant k of the rate determining
step than on the equilibrium constant K for adduct formation, as
discussed above. So for Cu phthalocyanines, electron-donating
substituents would favor the value of k more than their detrimental
effect on the value of K in the rate expression (48).
Apart from the explanations given above, no other interpretation for the observation that the Cu complexes follow a trend that is
opposite to what is observed for the Ni chelates is suggested in the
literature. One could speculate that with the most active Ni complexes, the nature of the binding of the NO molecule with the Ni
center is different to that with Cu. The participation of the ligand in
the binding process for each group of complexes (NiPcs or CuPcs)
cannot be ruled out.

6. Catalytic properties of MPcs in electrochemical oxidation
of nitrite
The electrochemical activation of nitrite is frequently limited
by slow electron transfer at conventional electrodes and complicated by irreversible passivation of the electrode surface. In order
to avoid such limitations, several studies have reported on the
use of chemically modiﬁed electrodes with phthalocyanines, porphyrins, hemoglobin, and myoglobin for the reduction of nitrite
[150,276,441–447]. In spite of the fact that the anodic electrochemical determination of this anion offers several advantages, such as
no interference from nitrate and from molecular oxygen, there are
very few reports related to the oxidation of nitrite [277,448]. Table 9
recapitulates some signiﬁcant examples of the several approaches
described in the literature.
Regarding previous studies devoted to the study of the electrocatalytic activity of MPcs based molecular materials of potential
interest for the activation of various species, a large variety of metallophthalocyanines (Co, Cr, Fe, Ni, Mn, Cu and Zn) were explored
in order to get further insights into the catalytic electrooxidation
process of nitrite [448]. The study was aimed at establishing the
role of the metal center and that of the nature of the ligand on
the electrocatalytic activity of the obtained modiﬁed electrodes
and a short theoretical approach was achieved to provide a possible structure/reactivity correlation. Indeed, reactivity descriptors
deﬁned in the framework of the Density Functional Theory (DFT)
such as the Fukui function [449] have been reported in the literature to characterize the activity of sites within transition metal
MPcs [450–453]. These descriptors discriminate between reactivity of the metal center from that located on the ligand, in terms of
the soft and hard local character in agreement with the global and
local HSAB (hard soft acid base) principle [450–453].

rotating disk electrode modiﬁed with the various examined MPcs

give almost parallel lines with slopes close to 0.059 V/decade [448]
so it is possible to compare activities as currents at a constant
potential. This comparison gives the following trend in reactivities:
FePc > MnPc > CrPc > CoPc ≈ NiPc ≈ ZnPc > CuPc.
In general, it appears that MPcs with redox active metal centers
are catalytically more active than those having a redox inactive
metal center. More precisely, FePc is the most active catalyst, while
CuPc is the less active complex. The similarity in the Tafel slopes
indicates a common rate-determining step for the reaction activated by different complexes regardless of the nature of the metal.
Fig. 23 illustrates the dependence of the kinetic currents Ik ,
measured at 0.65 and 0.68 V versus SCE, versus the M(III)/M(II)
redox potential for the complexes that exhibit this process, namely Cr(III)Pc(-2)/Cr(II)Pc(-2), Mn(III)Pc(-2)/Mn(II)Pc(-2),
Fe(III)Pc(-2)/Fe(II)Pc(-2) and Co(III)Pc(-2)/Co(II)Pc(-2) processes.
The correlation is not linear. Indeed, a volcano plot is obtained as
observed for other reactions discussed in this review. The data were
plotted in such a way that the driving force or oxidizing power
of the MPcs increases from left to right. Thus, it appears that log
(Ik ) increases with driving force, then it reaches a maximum and
decreases as the oxidizing power of MPcs increases. This illustrates
once more the concept that the redox potential of the catalyst needs
to be located in a certain potential window to obtain maximum
activity as discussed before for other reactions.
The theoretical calculations for the Fukui function f+ showed the
+
+
fx values calculated for Cr and Mn, and fSOMO,x
values obtained for
Fe and Co illustrate dramatic change when comparing the corresponding atoms of the ligand (C,N,H) with that of the metal center.
For all these metals, it was observed that the metal center presents
the highest value of the Fukui function. In contrast, the ligand
atoms have the lowest f+ values. These results indicate that the preferred site along the [M(III)Pc]+ molecule to receive one electron is
the metallic center. Although the CrPc molecule is open shell, the
+
index is not used because the calculated symmetry for the
fSOMO,x
SOMO molecular orbital indicates that the SOMO will not be able
to interact with the HOMO molecular orbital of nitrite. With the
exception to NiPc, the fx+ values obtained for atoms belonging to
the ligand in the M(II)Pc set are much higher that the one calculated for the metal atom. Thus, one can conclude that for the CuPc
and ZnPc molecules, the preferred sites to attract one electron are
located on the ligand. In the case of NiPc, the calculation shows
that both ligand atoms (C, N) and the metal atom center present
similar fx+ values suggesting that one electron can be captured by

both sites. This reveals that for the M(II)Pc complexes, there is no
unique preferred site, as it is the case for the [M(III)Pc]+ complexes,
with each site having a minor probability of attack. These theoretical predictions are in agreement with the experimental results
discussed above. Indeed, on the basis of the electronic structure
calculated in the gas phase, for FePc there is one preferred site for a
nucleophilic attack which corresponds to the iron center. However,
in CuPc there are several sites for this kind of attack, mainly located
on the ligand and therefore present a less electrophilic power than
the metal center in FePc.
In order to get further insights on this behavior, the activity of various phthalocyanines bearing electron-donating and
electron-withdrawing substituents on the ligand were explored.
Particularly Fe and Cu derivatives since these metal-based
complexes showed the highest and the lowest activity, respectively. For iron complexes, the reactivity decreases as follows:
4␤(NO2 )FePc > 4␤(COOH)FePc > FePc > Fe(Py)Pc > 8␤(OCH3 )FePc >
16(Cl)FePc > 4␤(SO3 − )FePc and the most active complexes
(4␤(NO2 )FePc and 4␤(COOH)FePc) show slightly higher Tafel
slopes. For the copper complexes, the activity decreases as:
4␤(NO2 )CuPc > 4␤(NH2 )CuPc > 4␣(N(CH3 )2 )4␤((CH3 )3 )CuPc > CuNc
> 8␣(OBu)CuPc > 4␤(OBu)CuPc > 8␣(OBu)CuNc > 4␤(SO3 − )CuPc >
CuPc > 16(F)CuPc > TPyr3,4CuPz. In both cases, Fe and Cu, the most
active complexes are those bearing four nitro substituents on the
periphery of the phthalocyanine ligand.
Fig. 24 shows a linear correlation between the Fe(III)/Fe(II) redox
potential and the sum of the Hammett parameters
[367,454].
Even though FePc and 4␤(NO2 )FePc exhibit similar formal potentials, their
values are far apart. This could be an indication
that the measured formal potential for 4␤(NO2 )FePc might not be
indicative of only the metal center redox activity but also that of
another redox active group. The plot of log(Ik ), at 0.65 and 0.68 V
versus SCE, versus the redox potential of the Fe(III)/Fe(II) process
of the examined FePcs is linear, with a negative slope (see Fig. 25a).
The same happens with the plot of log(Ik ), at 0.65 and 0.68 V versus SCE, versus the Hammett parameters (Fig. 25b). Such linear
correlation is not surprising since the redox potentials of phthalocyanines are themselves linearly correlated with the sum of the
Hammett parameters of the groups located on the periphery of the
ligand (see Fig. 24). 4␤(NO2 )FePc was not included as its activity
is very high (log Ik = −3.8 at 0.68 V versus SCE) and falls well off
the linear correlations. The nitro groups help in promoting a faster
reaction than the redox potential can predict. This is probably due
to some electronic effects of this group which are not well established. In general, with the exception of 4␤(NO2 )FePc, these results

potential of the Fe–Pcs. (B) Plot of log(Ik ) (at E = 0.65 and 0.68 V) versus the Hammett
parameters of the substituents for Fe–Pcs.

suggest that the activity of the adsorbed complex decreases as the
Fe(III)/Fe(II) redox potential becomes more positive and this would
correspond to the descending portion of the volcano plot of Fig. 23.
From this kinetic analysis and from other evidences provided
in the literature, the following reaction scheme for nitrite electrocatalytic oxidation mediated by adsorbed FePcs was suggested (Rn
represents the n substituents on the phthalocyanine ligand):
[Fe(III)R n Pc]+ + NO2 −
[Fe(II)R n Pc· · ·(NO2 )]
+

[Fe(II)R n Pc· · ·(NO2 )]
+

[Fe(III)R n Pc-(NO2 )] + e
+

[Fe(III)R n Pc-(NO2 )] → [Fe(III)R n Pc] + NO2

(49)
−

(50)
(51)

Step 51 can be rate controlling and this would agree with the Tafel
slopes close to 0.060 V/decade reported for the oxidation of nitrite
on the FePcs. However, for 4␤(NO2 )FePc and 4␤(COOH)FePc the
slopes are 0.090 V/decade. This could be the value of slope if step
50 is rate controlling with an asymmetrical energy barrier (symmetry factor ␣ = 0.65). However it seems unlikely that for those
two catalysts the rate determining step is different from that for
the other complexes. There could be other factors that increase the
Tafel slope from 0.060 to 0.090 V and this requires further investigation. The decrease in activity with increasing driving force may
be due to a decrease in the electronic coupling between the donor
(nitrite) and the acceptor (metal center in the complex). Reaction
40 could explain the inverted correlations in Fig. 25. Indeed, the
electron withdrawing groups should facilitate adduct formation
through the pre-equilibrium of step 49 whereas electron-donating

J.H. Zagal et al. / Coordination Chemistry Reviews 254 (2010) 2755–2791

2781

groups would facilitate the release of one electron from the adduct
in step 50. It is possible that the inverted correlation of Fig. 25 is
part of a volcano correlation, where the ascending portion is missing since the range of redox potentials examined is not wide enough
to show that region.
In the case of CuPcs there are also complexes that show
Tafel slopes higher than 0.060 V/decade, namely 4␤(NO2 )CuPc,
4␤(NH2 )CuPc and 4␤(OPhC(CH3 )2 Ph)CuPc that give slope in the
range 0.080–0.090 V/decade. In a general manner, in the case of
NiPc, CuPc and ZnPc, the adduct that could be formed between
nitrite and these MPcs is probably different from that involving
the iron-based phthalocyanines since it does not involve the redox
activity at the metal center. The mechanism may be as follows:
[M(II)R n Pc] + NO2 −
[M(II)R n Pc-(NO2 )]−

[M(II)R n Pc-(NO2 )]−
[M(II)R n Pc-(NO2 )] + e−

[M(II)R n Pc-(NO2 )] → [M(II)R n Pc-M] + NO2

(52)
(53)
(54)

So the role of the metal complexes is to bind the NO2 − molecule
and this facilitates the electron transfer from the electrode to
the bound nitrite to form intermediates or products. Finally, Tafel
slopes close to 0.060 V/decade indicate that the transfer of the ﬁrst
electron is fast, followed by a slow chemical rate determining (step
54). Both mechanisms written above are hypothetical assuming
NO2 is the ﬁnal product of the reaction but it is likely that at high
potentials nitrate ions are also formed.

7.1. Electrooxidation of hydrazine

[LM(II)-N2 H3 ] + OH → LM(II) + N2 H2 + H2 O + e

Hydrazine (N2 H4 ) is a very important organic compound
because of its wide application in industrial, pharmaceutical, fuel
cell, and biological ﬁelds due to its high reactivity [455]. Thus,
the oxidation of hydrazine to molecular nitrogen has been extensively studied over the past years [79,84,387,456–459], and the
mechanism and kinetics of hydrazine oxidation have been analyzed under a wide range of conditions, in solution and with several
electrodes [460]. Because of the large overpotential of hydrazine
at conventional electrodes, one promising approach to minimize overvoltage effects is through the use of an electrocatalytic
process at chemically modiﬁed electrodes with phthalocyanines
[75,80,96,461–463]. As expected, as seen for other reactions discussed in this review, the catalytic activity of MPc is dependent on
the nature of central metal in the phthalocyanine [84]. Amongst
phthalocyanines, cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc) and substituted
CoPc exhibit relatively high catalytic activity [387,456,460–463].
Any molecule or species that requires an interaction with an active
site to undergo an electron transfer process could react catalytically
in the presence of a metal phthalocyanine.
Hydrazine is a highly reactive molecule that can be oxidized via
four electrons to give molecular nitrogen (E◦ = 1.16 V versus NHE). It
has been used in the anode of fuel cells [464]. Hydrazine is known
to interact with transition metal phthalocyanines [465] and this
has been conﬁrmed by several spectroscopic studies including IR
[466] and EPR. [467]. Oxidation of hydrazine by air is also catalyzed by MPc and 4␤(SO3 − )MPc [466,469]. Several studies have
shown that the electrooxidation of hydrazine to molecular nitrogen is catalyzed by phthalocyanines of several transition metals
[2,3,6–8,75,77,79,80,84,387,416,460,461,470,471].
The redox catalysis concept can also be applied to the oxidation of hydrazine and the mechanisms proposed [70–75] take into
account the M(II)/M(I) reversible couple of the metal in the phthalo-

where L = Pc, and M = Fe, Mn and Cr.
The hydrazine non-bonding orbitals responsible for the oxidation of this molecule results from the ␲-␴* and ␲*-␴ orbital mixing
due to the pyramidalization at each N center. This hybridization
changes the original ␲* character of the HOMO to a non-bonding
orbital similar to the 3a1 lone-pair of ammonia [472], The resulting MO’s are ideally polarized for a ␴ interaction with a dz2 -like
metal orbital. In contrast to the O2 activation, in this case electron
donation is in one direction, from N2 H4 to the metal.
Cardenas-Jirón and co-workers [473,474] have proposed two
quantum chemistry theoretical models in the gas phase at the
density functional theory B3LYP/LACVP(d) level of calculation to
rationalize the hydrazine oxidation catalyzed by Co(II)Pc. These
theoretical models that are described in terms of energy proﬁles
include a through-space mechanism for the transfer of the ﬁrst electron of the hydrazine and a through-bond mechanism proposed for
the transfer of the three electrons remaining. The main difference
between both models arises from a one-electron and one-proton
alternate transfer for model 1 and a two-electron and two-proton
alternate transfer for model 2. They conclude that model 1 is more
reasonable than model 2 because the whole oxidation process is
always exergonic.
Fig. 26 shows a volcano curve in which the activity is plotted
versus the number of d-electrons in the metallophthalocyanine.
Again, as observed for O2 reduction, the iron complexes show the
highest activity. This strongly suggests that the best match of energies between the metal d orbitals and the hydrazine HOMO occurs
for iron phthalocyanines. This seems to indicate that the energies
of the O2 and N2 H4 HOMOs are not far from each other. In fact
if one plots overpotential for O2 reduction versus overpotential for
N2 H4 oxidation for each metallophthalocyanine a linear correlation
is obtained [14].

of hydrazine on CoPcs with different substituents.
Adapted from ref. [83].

A correlation between electrocatalytic activity (as current normalized by the number of Pcs molecules per unit of area) for the
oxidation of hydrazine in alkaline media gives non-linear correlations (Figs. 27 and 28) when the activity is plotted versus the
M(II)/M(I) redox potential of CoPcs and FePcs. This illustrates again
the concept “tuning” the redox potential of the catalyst to a desired
value, using appropriate groups on the phthalocyanine ligand to
obtain the highest activity. It is important to point out here that
macrocyclic complexes that are not phthalocyanines do ﬁt in this
volcano correlation indicating that the redox potential of the cata-

lyst is a good reactivity index and seems to be independent of the
nature of the ligand in the complex [85,475].
As shown for other reactions, the electrocatalytic activity of electrodes modiﬁed with MPcs can be enhanced, sometimes by two
orders or magnitude or more if carbon nanotubes are incorporated
on the electrode surface [476]. Geraldo et al. have shown [86] that
single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) functionalized with CoPc
enhances the catalytic activity of the complex itself without any
change in the reaction mechanism. A synergistic effect, in terms of
reactivity when the new nanocomposite material is adsorbed on
the glassy carbon (GC) electrode, is observed. The obtained hybrid
electrodes were tested under hydrodynamic conditions, showing
two different oxidation processes, which suggest the presence of
two different types of active sites on the electrode surface catalyzing the reaction. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images (Fig. 29)
showed the clear differences in surface roughness for each ﬁlm,
conﬁrming the different compositions of the hybrid electrodes [86].
One important application of electrodes modiﬁed with phthalocyanines in relation to hydrazine oxidation is the possibility to
make electrochemical sensors using this molecule. Kubota and
co-workers [477] have reported that 4␤(SO3 − )NiPc immobilized
onto titanized silica gel shows high stability and catalytic activity
for hydrazine oxidation. The process is controlled by the electron transfer step and no diffusion limitation was observed. The
modiﬁed electrode was very sensitive for hydrazine, giving a detection limit of 1.0 × 10−5 mol L−1 , for an applied potential of 450 mV
versus SCE. Ozoemena [478] has described the electrocatalytic
behavior of a GC modiﬁed with CoPc peripherally tetrasubstituted with cobalt(II)tetraphenylporphyrin (4(Ph)CoP) complexes
via ether linkages (i.e., CoPc-(4(Ph)CoP)4 , see Fig. 1). The viability
of this supramolecular complex as a redox mediator for the anodic
oxidation and sensitive amperometric determination of hydrazine
in alkaline conditions was tested. The proposed amperometric
sensor displays excellent characteristics for the determination of
hydrazine in 0.2 M NaOH; such as low overpotentials (+100 mV
versus Ag|AgCl), very fast amperometric response time (1 s), linear
concentration range of up to 230 ␮M, with micromolar detection
limit, high sensitivity and stability. Also Ozoemena and Nyokong
[82] have studied the electrocatalytic oxidation and detection of
hydrazine in pH 7.0 by using gold electrode modiﬁed with SAM
ﬁlms of FePc axially ligated to a preformed 4-mercaptopyridine
SAMs. The mechanism for the interaction of hydrazine with
the FePc–SAM is proposed to involve the Fe(III)Pc/Fe(II)Pc redox
process. Using cyclic voltammetry and Osteryoung square wave
voltammetry, hydrazine was detected over a linear concentration
range of 1.3 × 10−5 to 9.2 × 10−5 mol L−1 with limits of detection
as low as 5 and 11 ␮M, respectively. Finally, Li et al. have fabricated covalently attached multilayer ﬁlm electrode containing CoPc
which show electrocatalytic activity oxidation of hydrazine [455].
7.2. Electrooxidation of hydroxylamine

Fig. 28. Variation of log(I/ complex) (currents normalized for the surface concentration of the catalyst) versus the formal potential of the catalyst for the
electrooxidation of hydrazine on FePcs with different substituents.
Adapted from ref. [475].

In connection with phthalocyanines, hydroxylamine has been
much less studied than hydrazine. Hydroxylamine, NH2 OH, is a
strong reducing agent. It is used as an anti-oxidant in soaps and
fatty acids and as an intermediate in the production of pesticides
and pharmaceutical drugs. It induces highly speciﬁc mutations
and is very toxic for aquatic organisms. EPR spectroscopic studies
conducted at low temperature have indicated that hydroxylamine
forms stable adducts with Co and 4␤(SO3 − )FePcs [467]. It has also
been shown that hydroxylamine is catalytically oxidized by molecular oxygen in the presence of 4␤(SO3 − )MPcs in aqueous solutions
[467–469]. From these results, one would expect that phthalocyanines, when adsorbed on a graphite electrodic surface would
catalyze the electrochemical oxidation of NH2 OH. This is indeed
the case: 4␤(SO3 − )FePc possesses some catalytic activity for the

reaction [110] but the catalytic effects are not as pronounced as
those observed for other reactions like O2 reduction and hydrazine
oxidation. This has been attributed to the formation of a “stable adduct” where NH2 OH binds to the 4␤(SO3 − )FePc preventing
new molecules of hydroxylamine to interact with Fe and react.
To have pronounced catalytic effects, the adducts or intermediates need to be labile and decompose fast to maintain the catalytic
cycle functioning. As discussed for other reactions, the interaction of the reacting molecule needs to be not too weak, not too
strong, as indicated by the volcano correlations. For the particular case of hydroxylamine, its interaction with the Fe sites is too
strong. Electrochemical evidence was reported for the formation of
Fe—hydroxylamine adduct as the cyclic voltammogram of adsorbed
4␤(SO3 − )FePc is modiﬁed in the presence of small amounts of
hydroxylamine [110]. The catalytic effects are small as the reaction
rates for the most active 4␤(SO3 − )MPcs are only 7 times greater
than the least active ones. Evidence for the formation of these
adducts has also been found electrochemically for 4␤(SO3 − )CoPc
[110]. From the kinetic parameters determined electrochemically,
the following mechanism has been proposed [14,110]:
LM + NH2 OH

LM-NH2 OH

LM-NH2 OH + OH− → [LM-NHOH]− + H2 O (r.d.s.)

L = Pc, which agrees with a −1 order in protons.
The donor–acceptor intermolecular hardness concept (ÁDA )
associated with the interaction between substituted cobalt
phthalocyanines (Co(X)nPc) acceptor species such as hydrazine
and hydroxylamine has been used to explain the relative reactivity of the different Co phthalocyanines for the oxidation of these
molecules. Semiempirical (PM3) and ab initio (ROHF: CEP-31G and
ROHF: 6-31G) theoretical methods were used to determine ÁDA
for the four charge transfer interactions. Theoretical results of ÁDA
correlate well with rate constants for electrooxidation hydrazine
and hydroxylamine and for electroreduction of O2 for processes
occurring on phthalocyanines conﬁned on a graphite electrode.
The lower ÁDA the higher is the reactivity. The molecular hardness

(Á) was also calculated as deﬁned in density functional theory, of
Co(X)nPc. Other macrocyclic compounds NNNNtetramethyltetra3,4-pyridoporphyrazinocobalt(II) [88] and vitamin B12 [479] also
show high activity for the oxidation of hydroxylamine.
8. Catalytic properties of MPcs in electrochemical reactions
involving other biologically and environmentally relevant
compounds
8.1. Phenols and organohalides
Phenols are widespread in nature. They are released into the
environment in a number of ways such as during the manufacture of industrial products like plastics, pharmaceuticals,
dyes and pesticides (e.g. pentachlorophenol) and they accumulate in the environment as recalcitrant contaminants [480,481].
Organohalides are also recognized as important environmental pollutants arising from industrial as well as biological sources. Indeed,
halogenated methanes and ethanes are often used as solvents.
Trichloroacetic acid is for example used as plaguicide in some countries, although it is known to be toxic.
Electrochemical methods are preferred in analysis of phenols
and halogenated organics since often traditional methods require
extensive separation. However, direct determination using noble
metal electrodes is not favored due to high overpotentials. Electrochemical oxidation of phenols readily occurs on unmodiﬁed
electrodes, but oxidation results in the formation of dimers which
poison the electrodes, decreasing the oxidation currents [482]. In
order to improve the sensitivity and selectivity, chemically modiﬁed electrodes are employed. In this regard, MPcs have shown
catalytic activity towards the detection of phenols and other species
when they are employed as homogeneous catalysts or when they
are adsorbed to electrodes (Table 10).
Bedioui and co-workers have studied the electrocatalytic reduction of trichloroacetic acid (TCA) on electrodes modiﬁed with heme
proteins [483,484] or porphyrins [485], but very little work has
been done for the reduction of TCA using electrodes modiﬁed

amitrole at low oxidation potentials in basic media, a detection
limit of 0.04 ␮g mL−1 was obtained using a injection system [487].
4␤(SO3 − )CuPc was used as component of the microemulsion and
lowered the overpotential for the reduction of o-chlorophenol by
1 V, hence showing promise for the catalytic decomposition of 1,1bis(4-chlorophenyl)-2,2,2-trichloroethane [488].
Biosensors based on enzymes have been developed for many
electrochemical analyses. The use of MPc complexes as part of the
catalytic system improves the sensitivities of the biosensors. On
screen-printed CoPc electrodes containing lactate dehydrogenase,
oxidation of pentachlorophenol occurred at a low potential of 0.3 V
[267].
The catalytic activity of NiPc complexes for the oxidation of phe˜
nols has been studied by Ureta-Zanartu
and co-workers [125,489].
Electrooxidation of 2-chlorophenol takes place on electropolymerized 4␤(SO3 − )NiPc [125,489]. The electrochemical oxidation of
phenol, 4-chlorophenol and nitrophenol using electropolymerized
NiPc (nickel hydroxy tetraphenoxy pyrrole phthalocyanine (poly4␤(PhPy)Ni(OH)Pc)) modiﬁed vitreous carbon electrodes has also
been reported [126]. The ﬁlms were formed by electropolymerizing
pyrrole-substituted phenoxyphthalocyanine poly-4␤(PhPy)NiPc
in aqueous 0.1 M NaOH solution. The poly-4␤(PhPy)Ni(OH)Pc
ﬁlms show better stability and resistance to electrode fouling
compared to poly-4␤(PhPy)NiPc and unmodiﬁed electrodes. The
resistance to surface fouling and stability can be attributed to the
structure of the ring substituent on the phthalocyanine macrocycle and to the particular O–Ni–O bridged architecture of the
˜
nickel phthalocyanine ﬁlm [126]. Ureta-Zanartu
and co-workers
[490,491] have characterized ﬁlms formed on glassy carbon electrodes modiﬁed by electropolymerization of two water-soluble
compounds, Ni(II)tetrasulfophthalocyanine (4␤(SO3 − )NiPc) and
Ni(II)tetrasulfophenylporphyrin (4(PhSO3 − )NiP), and of two
water-insoluble compounds, Ni(II)tetraaminophthalocyanine
and
Ni(II)tetraaminophenylporphyrin
(4␤(NH2 )NiPc)

(4(PhNH2 )NiP), using impedance measurements. The Nyquist
plots of all these ﬁlms shown in the potential range of the
Ni(II)/Ni(III) process showed the semicircle typical of a charge
transfer, the charge-transfer resistance decreasing very much
with increasing potential. The uncompensated resistance of the
GC electrode is barely affected by the ﬁlms, showing that they
are very porous. This is in contrast to polymeric ﬁlms formed
by 4␤(NH2 )CoPc (Co tetraaminophthalocyanine) where only the
external layer is accessible to reacting molecules. The IR spectra of the poly-4(PhSO3 − )NiP and the poly-4␤(SO3 − )NiPc ﬁlms
shows bands at 3628 cm−1 and 3500 cm−1 , respectively, which
could be due to interstitial water molecules occluded during
the polymerization. The Ni 2p XP spectra indicate that the magnetic character of the Ni(II) ions in 4(PhSO3 − )NiP is dramatically
changed by the polymerization, from diamagnetic in the monomer
to paramagnetic in the polymeric ﬁlm, indicating the formation of
Ni–O–Ni bridges or of clusters of Ni(OH)2 . On the contrary, the Ni
2p XP spectra of the unactivated 4(PhNH2 )NiP, ﬁlm, in which the
Ni(II)/Ni(III) process was absent, showed only diamagnetic Ni(II).
Therefore, it is concluded that only paramagnetic Ni(II) ions can be
electrooxidized to Ni(III) [491].
8.2. Catecholamines
Dopamine (DA), epinephrine (EP) and serotonin (5hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) are important catecholamine
neurotransmitters in biological systems. Serotonin regulates
mood and sleep and is a target for pharmaceutical treatment of
depression. Dopamine is implicated in locomotion. Deﬁciencies in
DA can result in some neurological disorders such as Parkinson’s
disease.
Electrochemical techniques show promise for the analysis of
neurotransmitters in general because of the possibility of direct
measurement of the analytes in vivo [492–498] and phthalocyanines play an important role in the development of electrodes for
sensing purposes. Non-electrochemical techniques involve withdrawing samples from the subject followed by rigorous separation,
conditioning and other forms of sample pretreatment methods
prior to analysis. Advantages of electrochemical methods include
high selectivity, good sensitivity and very low detection limits
[494,495]. Simultaneous detection of neurotransmitters (such as

J.H. Zagal et al. / Coordination Chemistry Reviews 254 (2010) 2755–2791

serotonin and dopamine) is important since they coexist in biological systems. The detection of the neurotransmitters on solid
electrodes often suffers from fouling due to the accumulation of
the oxidation products on the electrodes, resulting in poor selectivity and sensitivity. Thus the development of electrode modiﬁers
which can improve the detection of neurotransmitters is of continuing interest (Table 10). The catecholamines also show potentials
very close to one another, for example noradrenaline, dopamine
and adrenaline show peaks at 0.15, 0.17 and 0.16 V versus SCE [312]
and DA at 0.35 V versus SCE. Thus simultaneous detection of the catecholamines is difﬁcult and the use of electrocatalysts to improve
potential separation is an active area of research.
The other challenge in the detection of these neurotransmitters is the presence of a large excess of ascorbic acid that is always
present in extra-cellular ﬂuid and frequently interferes with the
current signals obtained for the detection of neurotransmitters
due to the closeness of their oxidation potentials to that of ascorbic acid. There have been many approaches towards overcoming
this problem of interference posed by ascorbic acid. One of the
most frequently used approach is to pre-coat the electrode surface

2785

with a perm-selective layer of negatively charged polymer, such
as Naﬁon® , which repels all kinds of negatively charged species,
in particular ascorbate, away from the electrode surface thereby
preventing their oxido-reduction. In many other cases a modiﬁer
(such as an MPc molecule) that exhibits electrocatalytic activity
towards the oxidation of the neurotransmitters is ﬁrst applied to
the electrode surface before ﬁnally coating the electrode with the
negatively charged polymer. The use of Naﬁon® often results in
the loss of sensitivity. A carbon paste electrode containing the
negatively charged 4␤(SO3 − )MPc complexes (M = Co(II) and Ni(II))
eliminates the effects of ascorbic acid by acting in the same manner as Naﬁon® without the loss of sensitivity observed for the
latter [268]. The oxidation peak for DA was obtained at 0.18 V
on 4␤(SO3 − )FePc modiﬁed electrode. The 4␤(SO3 − )FePc modiﬁed
electrode allowed for the determination of DA, nitric oxide and
5-HT in the presence of large concentrations of ascorbic acid.
The reduction of the oxidation product of dopamine (DAox ) by
ascorbic acid in solution (Eqs. (63)–(65)), has been shown [269] to
induce a shift of the DA potential as a function of ratio of concentration of dopamine to ascorbic acid, making it possible to determine

where IDA and IAA are the currents of dopamine and ascorbic acid,
respectively, k and k are the slopes of calibration plots of ascorbic
acid and DA, respectively, Ibg is the background current, cAA and
cDA are the concentrations of AA and DA, respectively. Using these
equations and an 4␤(SO3 − )FePc modiﬁed carbon paste electrode,
the detection limits of 4.5 ± 0.2 × 10−7 and 7.5 ± 0.5 × 10−7 mol L−1
were obtained respectively for dopamine and ascorbic acid for
cDA /cAA > 0.01 [269].
Finally, one can cite the following signiﬁcant examples
(Table 10):
(i) Carbon paste electrodes modiﬁed with nanosized CoPc particles with good catalytic behavior for the detection of DA
and AA [271]. The anodic peak potentials of DA and AA
appear well separated with good sensitivity in the presence of
cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), thus allowing their
simultaneous detection.
(ii) Electropolymerized 4␤(SO3 − )NiPc that improves the response
time towards serotonin [312]. The sensor can be used to determine serotonin in urine, requiring some pretreatment of the
sample before analysis. The detection limit is 0.8 ␮g L−1 . The
4␤(NH2 )Ni(OH)Pc (containing O–Ni–O bridges) shows high catalytic activity for the detection of DA via its oxidation, which is
much better than for poly-4␤(NH2 )NiPc without the O–Ni–O
oxo bridges [121].
(iii) Nanoparticles of 4␤(SO3 − )NiPc and the Chichá gum [272] in
a tetralayer with poly(allylamine hydrochloride) interposed
between the layers allows the detection of DA with a detection
limit of 1 × 10−5 M.
(iv) Indium tin oxide coated glass substrates modiﬁed with layer
by layer ﬁlms of polyaniline alternated with 4␤(SO3 − )FePc
show catalytic activity for the oxidation of DA. The activity is
explained in terms of a coordination between the two and the
formation of a (DA+ )4␤(SO3 − )FePc species via internal electron
transfer [273].
(v) Single-walled carbon nanotube SWCNT co-ordinated
to 4␤(NH2 )CoPc and assembled onto a preformed
aminoethanethiol SAM on gold electrode (Scheme 1) can
be used for the electrochemical detection of DA in pH 7.4 PBS
[499]. These studies prove that SWCNT greatly improves the
electronic communication between 4␤(NH2 )CoPc and the Au
electrode surface.

of view. So the electrocatalytic oxidation of glucose is a subject of
current interest. The electrochemical oxidation of glucose can also
be used for its detection using appropriate electrodes. MPcs show
catalytic activity for the oxidation of glucose. Santos and Baldwin
[500] were the ﬁrst to report that chemically modiﬁed electrodes
containing CoPc are active for the electrooxidation several sugars including glucose, galactose, maltose, lactose, ribose, fructose
and sucrose in alkaline media. Sun et al. [501] used self-assembled
molecular layer-based process on gold electrodes to allow the
ﬁxation of cobalt tetrasulfonated phthalocyanine to detect glucose. Several authors have proposed the use of Co phthalocyanine
derivatives [55,502–504] as mediators of glucose oxidation, in conjunction with glucose oxidase (GOX). Along these lines Hart and
co-workers have developed screen-printed electrodes which are
fabricated using water-based carbon ink [505] containing GOX and
CoPc. With this last approach it is possible to obtain low-cost electrodes for sensor applications.
Zagal and co-workers [59,60] have studied the role of the
Co(II)/Co(I) formal potential of the catalyst on the electrocatalytic
activity for glucose oxidation and have found volcano correlations, as reported for other reactions discussed in this article. The
activity of the different modiﬁed electrodes was tested by linear
voltammetry under hydrodynamic conditions using the rotating
disk technique. Tafel plots constructed from mass-transport corrected currents gave slopes ranging from 0.080 to 0.160 V/decade
for the different catalysts which suggests that the ﬁrst-one electron
step is rate controlling with the symmetry of the energy barrier
depending on the nature of the ligand of the Co complex. A plot
of log I versus the Co(II)/(I) formal potential gives a volcano curve
(see Fig. 30) with a slope close to 0.118 V for the ascending portion
and −0.20 V for the falling region. This is an “unsymmetrical” volcano, which is a common observation for other reactions discussed
in this review. This illustrates once more the concept that the formal potential of the catalyst needs to be tuned to a certain value for
achieving maximum activity not only for this reaction but probably
for most reactions catalyzed by phthalocyanines, porphyrins and
by macrocycyclic complexes in general. A theoretical interpretation of these results has been given in terms of Langmuir isotherms
[60] for the adsorption of glucose on the Co sites of the surfaceconﬁned metal complexes, as discussed before for the oxidation of
thiols and for other reactions. These electrodes modiﬁed with metal
complexes and with any reactive species present a great advantage
over conventional electrodes in the sense that their reactivity can be

9. Oxidation of glucose and other sugars at molecular
phthalocyanine electrodes
Future sensors, pacemakers, communication devices and other
microelectronics technology may be powered by bio fuel cells, i.e.
powered by sugars obtained from living systems that can include
human or plant living tissue. On the other hand, monitoring glucose
levels in human or animal ﬂuids is important from the medical point

controlled by manipulating the structure of the complex or reactive
molecule to be conﬁned on the surface of the electrode.
10. Conclusion and perspectives
MPcs are active catalysts for a large variety of electrochemical
reactions. Electrodes containing these complexes conﬁned on their
surfaces can be obtained by simple adsorption on graphite and carbon electrodes. However, more stable electrodes can be achieved by
coating their surfaces with electropolymerized complexes which
show similar activity than their monomer counterparts. Modiﬁed
electrodes can also be obtained on Au and Ag surfaces by using
self-assembled monolayers of thiols that can act as anchors of
macrocyclic complexes or by using complexes with thiol functionalities located on the periphery of the ligand, also serving as
anchors. Electrodes modiﬁed by this method show catalytic activity for several electrochemical reactions so essentially, the activity
of MPcs is almost independent of the method employed for electrode modiﬁcation and seems to be independent of the orientation
of the macrocyclic molecule on the electrode.
Fundamental studies carried out at adsorbed layers of these
complexes on graphite and carbon surfaces have demonstrated that
the redox potential is a very good reactivity index for predicting
catalytic activities for many reactions. Volcano-shaped correlations
have been reported between the electrocatalytic activity (as log I at
constant E) versus the Co(II)/(I) formal potential of Co-macrocyclics
for the oxidation of several thiols, hydrazine and glucose. For the
electroreduction of O2 only linear correlations between the electrocatalytic activity versus M(III)/M(II) redox potential have been
found using Cr, Mn, Fe and Co phthalocyanines. It is very likely that
these linear correlations are part of “incomplete” volcano correlations as found with earlier studies with thiol oxidation. The volcano
correlations strongly suggest that intermediate values of E◦ , the
formal potential of the complex, are optimum for achieving maximum activity, probably corresponding to surface coverages of an
M-molecule adduct equal to 0.5 and to standard free energies of
adsorption equal to zero. All these results indicate that the catalytic activity of MPcs for the oxidation of several molecules can be
“tuned” by manipulating the E◦ formal potential, using the proper
groups on the ligand. “Tuning” the redox potential can be achieved
by knowing the Hammett parameters of substituents that can be
located on the ligand for families bearing the same ligand. These
results are probably valid for the different methods of modiﬁcation
of the electrode and point out to the right direction in designing
better catalysts for many electrochemical reactions.
Finally, it is necessary to emphasize once more that MPcs are
extremely versatile materials with many applications in electrocatalysis, and they provide very good models for testing their
catalytic activity for many reactions in terms of simple parameters,
such as the redox potential of these molecules. The redox potential
can be easily modulated by placing the appropriate substituents
on peripheral or non-peripheral positions of the phthalocyanine
ligand. This is obviously valid for other macrocyclics like porphyrins. Even though the earlier applications of these complexes
were focused on providing active materials for electroreduction of
O2, for making active cathodes for fuel cells, the main trend in the
literature nowadays is to use these complexes for making active
electrodes for electrochemical sensors.
