2.1 Introduction
According to the classical theorem of Bernoulli, the frequency of occurrence of
an event A converges (in probability, in a sequence of independent trials to the
probability of this event). In some applications, however, it is necessary to draw
conclusions about the probabilities of the events of an entire class S from one and
the same sample. (In particular, this is necessary in the construction of learning
algorithms.) Here it is important to find out whether the frequencies converge
to the probabilities uniformly over the entire class of events S . More precisely,
it is important to find out whether the probability that the maximal deviation of
frequency from the corresponding probability over the class S exceeds a given small
number approaches zero in an unbounded number of trials. It turns out that even in
the simplest examples such uniform convergence may not take place. Therefore
we would like to have a criterion by which we can decide whether there is such

convergence or not. In this note we consider sufficient conditions for such uniform
convergence which do not depend on the properties of the distribution but are related
only to the internal properties of the class S , and we give a bound on the rate
of convergence also not depending on the distribution, and finally we point out
necessary and sufficient conditions for the uniform convergence of the frequencies
to the probabilities over the class of events S .

2.2 Statement of the Problem
Let X be a set of elementary events on which a probability measure is defined.
Let S be a collection of random events, i.e., of subsets of the space X measurable
relative to the measure (the system S belongs to a Borel system but does not
necessarily coincide with it).
Let X .l/ denote the space of samples from X of length l. On the space X .l/
we define the probability product measure by the condition P .Y1 Y2 : : : Yl / D
P .Y1 / P .Y2 / : : : P .Yl /, where Yi are measurable subsets of X . This formalises
the fact that sampling is repeated, i.e., the elements are chosen independently with
a fixed distribution.
For every sample x1 ; : : : ; xl and an event A we can define the frequency Al D
A .x1 ; : : : ; xl / of occurrence of the event A as equal to the ratio of the number nA
of those elements of the sample which belong to A to the overall length l of the
sample:
A .x1 ; : : : ; xl /

D nA = l:

Bernoulli’s theorem asserts that

over the class. The quantity .l/ is a point function on the space X .l/ .
We will assume that this function is measurable relative to the measure on
X .l/ , i.e., that .l/ is a random variable. If .l/ approaches 0 in probability with
unbounded increase of the sample size l, then we will say that the frequencies of the
events A 2 S converge in probability to the probabilities of these events uniformly
over the class S .

2.3 Some Additional Definitions
Let Xr D x1 ; : : : ; xr be a finite sample of elements from X . Every set A from
S determines a subsample XrA D xi1 ; : : : ; xik on this sample consisting of those
elements of the sample Xr which are in A. We will say that the set A induces the
subsample XrA on the sample Xr .
Denote the set of all distinct subsamples induced by the sets from S on the sample
Xr by S.x1 ; : : : ; xr /. The number of distinct subsamples of the sample Xr induced
by the sets from S (the number of elements of the set S.x1 ; : : : ; xr /) will be called
the index of the system S relative to the sample Xr and denoted by S .x1 ; : : : ; xr /.
Obviously it is always true that
S

.x1 ; : : : ; xr / Ä 2r :

The function mS .r/ D maxx1 ;:::;xr S .x1 ; : : : ; xr /, where the maximum is taken
over all samples of length r, is called the growth function of the class S .
Example 2.1. Let X be a straight line and S the set of all rays of the form x < a;
mS .r/ D r C 1.
Example 2.2. X is the segment Œ0; 1; S consists of all open sets; mS .r/ D 2r .
Example 2.3. Let X be n-dimensional Euclidean space. The set of events S consists
of all half-spaces of the form .x / > c, where is a vector and c a constant;
mS .r/ < r n .r > n/.
Along with the growth function mS .r/ consider the function

2.4 A Property of the Growth Function
The main property of the growth function of the class S is established by the
following theorem.
Theorem 2.1. The growth function mS .r/ is either identically equal to 2r or
majorized by the function r n , where n is the first value of r for which mS .n/ ¤ 2n .

2.5 Sufficient Conditions for Uniform Convergence
Not Depending on Properties of the Distribution
Sufficient conditions for the uniform convergence (with probability 1) of the
frequencies to the probabilities are established by the following theorem.
Theorem 2.2. If mS .r/ Ä r n , then

To prove this theorem, we establish the following lemma.
Take a sample x1 ; : : : ; xl ; xlC1 ; : : : ; x2l of length 2l and compute the frequencies
of occurrence of an event A on the first half-sample x1 ; : : : ; xl and the second
half-sample xlC1 ; : : : ; x2l . Denote the corresponding frequencies by A0 and A00 and

In the case where mS .r/ < r n , the inequality (*) implies uniform convergence in
probability. By a well-known lemma [1] from probability theory, we also establish
convergence with probability 1 under the conditions of the theorem.

According to Theorem 2.2 there is uniform convergence in Examples 2.1 and 2.3
considered in Sect. 2.3. The fact that there is uniform convergence in Example 2.1
coincides with the assertion of Glivenko’s theorem.
In many applications it is necessary to know the required sample size in order
to assert with probability at least 1 Á that the maximal deviation of the frequency
from the probability over the class of events S does not exceed ".

2.6 Necessary and Sufficient Conditions for the Uniform
Convergence of Frequencies to Probabilities
Theorem 2.3. For the uniform convergence (with probability 1) of the frequencies
to the probabilities over the class of events S the condition

is necessary and sufficient (here we assume the measurability of the function
S
.x1 ; : : : ; xl /).
For the proof of Theorem 2.3 we consider a lemma.
Lemma 2.2. The sequence M S .l/= l has a limit as l ! 1.
In the case where this limit is equal to 0, the sufficiency of the condition is proved
analogously to Theorem 2.2. For the proof of necessity we first establish that

We further establish that if liml!1 M S .l/= l D t ¤ 0 then there is a ı such that
lim P

whence liml!1 P .l/ > ı ¤ 0.
The theorem is proved.
