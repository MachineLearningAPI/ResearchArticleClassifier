Abstract
EnsembleSVM is a free software package containing efficient routines to perform ensemble
learning with support vector machine (SVM) base models. It currently offers ensemble
methods based on binary SVM models. Our implementation avoids duplicate storage and
evaluation of support vectors which are shared between constituent models. Experimental
results show that using ensemble approaches can drastically reduce training complexity
while maintaining high predictive accuracy. The EnsembleSVM software package is freely
available online at http://esat.kuleuven.be/stadius/ensemblesvm.
Keywords: classification, ensemble learning, support vector machine, bagging

1. Introduction
Data sets are becoming increasingly large. Machine learning practitioners are confronted
with problems where the main computational constraint is the amount of time available.
Problems become particularly challenging when the training sets no longer fit into memory.
Accurately solving the dual problem for SVM training with nonlinear kernels requires a run
time which is at least quadratic in the size of the training set n, thus training complexity
is Ω(n2 ) (Bottou and Lin, 2007; List and Simon, 2009).
EnsembleSVM employs a divide-and-conquer strategy by aggregating many SVM models,
trained on small subsamples of the training set. Through subdivision, total training time
decreases significantly, even though more models need to be trained. For example, training
p classifiers on subsamples of size n/p, results in an approximate complexity of Ω(n2 /p).
This reduction in complexity helps in dealing with large data sets and nonlinear kernels.

Ensembles of SVM models have been used in various applications (Wang et al., 2009;
Linghu and Sun, 2010; Mordelet and Vert, 2011). Collobert et al. (2002) use ensembles
for large scale learning and employ a neural network to aggregate base models. Valentini
and Dietterich (2003) provide an implementation which allows base models to use different
kernels. For efficiency reasons, we require base models to share a single kernel function.
While other implementations mainly focus on improving predictive performance, our
framework primarily aims to (i) make nonlinear large-scale learning feasible through complexity reductions and (ii) enable fast prototyping of novel ensemble algorithms.

2. Software Description
The EnsembleSVM software is freely available online under a LGPL license. EnsembleSVM
provides ensembles of instance-weighted SVMs, as defined in Equation (1). The default approach we offer is bagging, which is commonly used to improve the performance of unstable
classifiers (Breiman, 1996). In bagging, base models are trained on bootstrap subsamples
of the training set and their predictions are aggregated through majority voting.
Base model flexibility is maximized by using instance-weighted binary support vector
machine classifiers, as defined in Equation (1). This formulation lets users define misclassification penalties per training instance Ci , i = 1, . . . , n and encompasses popular approaches
such as C-SVC and class-weighted SVM (Cortes and Vapnik, 1995; Osuna et al., 1997).

When aggregating SVM models, the base models often share support vectors (SVs).
The EnsembleSVM software intelligently caches distinct SVs to ensure that they are only
stored and used for kernel evaluations once. As a result, EnsembleSVM models are smaller
and faster in prediction than ensemble implementations based on wrappers.
2.1 Implementation
EnsembleSVM has been implemented in C++ and makes heavy use of the standard library.
The main implementation focus is training speed. We use facilities provided by the C++11
standard and thus require a moderately recent compiler, such as gcc ≥ 4.7 or clang ≥ 3.2.
A portable Makefile system based on GNU autotools is used to build EnsembleSVM.
EnsembleSVM interfaces with LIBSVM to train base models (Chang and Lin, 2011). Our
code must be linked to LIBSVM but does not depend on a specific version. This allows users
to choose the desired version of the LIBSVM software in the back-end.
The EnsembleSVM programming framework is designed to facilitate prototyping of ensemble algorithms using SVM base models. We particularly provide extensive support to
define novel aggregation schemes, should the available options be insufficient. Key components are extensively documented and on a broad overview is provided on our wiki.1

The EnsembleSVM library was built with extensibility and user contributions in mind.
Major API functions are well documented to lower the threshold for external development.
The executable tools provided with EnsembleSVM are essentially wrappers for the library
itself. The tools can be considered as use cases of the main API functions to help developers.
2.2 Tools
The main tools in this package are esvm-train and esvm-predict, used to train and
predict with ensemble models. Both of these are pthread-parallelized. Additionally, the
merge-models tool can be used to merge standard LIBSVM models into ensembles. Finally,
esvm-edit provides facilities to modify the aggregation scheme used by an ensemble.
EnsembleSVM includes a variety of extra tools to facilitate basic operations such as
stratified bootstrap sampling, cross-validation, replacing categorical features by dummy
variables, splitting data sets and sparsifying standard data sets. We recommend retaining
the original ratio of positives and negatives in the training set when subsampling.

3. Benchmark Results
To illustrate the potential of our software, EnsembleSVM 2.0 has been benchmarked with
respect to LIBSVM 3.17. To keep the experiments simple, we use majority voting to aggregate
predictions, even though more sophisticated methods are offered. For reference, we also list
the best obtained accuracy with a linear model, trained using LIBLINEAR (Fan et al., 2008).
Linear methods are common in large-scale learning due to their speed, but may result in
significantly decreased accuracy. This is why scalable nonlinear methods are desirable.
We used two binary classification problems, namely the covtype and ijcnn1 data sets.2
Both data sets are balanced. Features were always scaled to [0, 1]. We have used CSVC as SVM and base models (∀ i : Ci = C). Reported numbers are averages of 5 test
runs to ensure reproducibility. We used the RBF kernel, defined by the kernel function
2
κ(xi , xj ) = e−γ||xi −xj || . Optimal parameter selection was done through cross-validation.
The covtype data set is a common classification benchmark featuring 54 dimensions
(Blackard and Dean, 1999). We randomly sampled balanced training and test sets of 100, 000
and 40, 000 instances respectively and classified class 2 versus all others. The ijcnn1 data
set was used in a machine learning challenge during IJCNN 2001 (Prokhorov, 2001). It
contains 35, 000 training instances in 22 dimensions.
Results in Table 1 show several interesting trends. Training EnsembleSVM models is
orders of magnitude faster, because training SVMs on small subsets significantly reduces
complexity. Subsampling induces smaller kernels per base model resulting in lower overall memory use. Due to our parallelized implementation, ensemble models were faster in
prediction than LIBSVM models in both experiments despite having twice as many SVs.
The ensembles in these experiments are competitive with a traditional SVM even though
we used simple majority voting. For covtype, ensemble accuracy is 3% lower than a single
SVM and for ijcnn1 the ensemble is marginally better (0.2%). Linear SVM falls far short
in terms of accuracy for both experiments, but is trained much faster (< 2 seconds).

Table 1: Summary of benchmark results per data set: test set accuracy, number of support vectors and training time. Accuracies are listed for a single LIBSVM model,
LIBLINEAR model and an ensemble model.

We obtained good results with very basic aggregation. Collobert et al. (2002) illustrated
that more sophisticated aggregation methods can improve the predictive performance of ensembles. Others have reported performance improvements over standard SVM for ensembles
using majority voting (Valentini and Dietterich, 2003; Wang et al., 2009).

4. Conclusions
EnsembleSVM provides users with efficient tools to experiment with ensembles of SVMs.
Experimental results show that training ensemble models is significantly faster than training
standard LIBSVM models while maintaining competitive predictive accuracy.
Linear methods are frequently applied in large-scale learning, mainly due to their low
training complexity. Linear methods are known to have competitive accuracy for high
dimensional problems. As our benchmarks showed, the difference in accuracy may be large
for low dimensional problems. As such, fast nonlinear methods remain desirable in largescale learning, particularly for low dimensional tasks with many training instances. Our
benchmarks illustrate the potential of the ensemble approaches offered by EnsembleSVM.
Ensemble performance may be improved by using more complex aggregation schemes.
EnsembleSVM currently offers various aggregation schemes, both linear and nonlinear. Additionally, it facilitates fast prototyping of novel methods.
EnsembleSVM strives to provide high-quality, user-friendly tools and an intuitive programming framework for ensemble learning with SVM base models. The software will be
kept up to date by incorporating promising new methods and ideas when they are presented
in the literature. User requests and suggestions are welcome and appreciated.
