Abstract
Early stopping is a form of regularization based on choosing when to stop running an
iterative algorithm. Focusing on non-parametric regression in a reproducing kernel Hilbert
space, we analyze the early stopping strategy for a form of gradient-descent applied to
the least-squares loss function. We propose a data-dependent stopping rule that does not
involve hold-out or cross-validation data, and we prove upper bounds on the squared error
of the resulting function estimate, measured in either the L2 (P) and L2 (Pn ) norm. These
upper bounds lead to minimax-optimal rates for various kernel classes, including Sobolev
smoothness classes and other forms of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. We show through
simulation that our stopping rule compares favorably to two other stopping rules, one based
on hold-out data and the other based on Stein’s unbiased risk estimate. We also establish
a tight connection between our early stopping strategy and the solution path of a kernel
ridge regression estimator.

1. Introduction
The phenomenon of overfitting is ubiquitous throughout statistics. It is especially problematic in nonparametric problems, where some form of regularization is essential in order to
prevent it. In the non-parametric setting, the most classical form of regularization is that
of Tikhonov regularization, where a quadratic smoothness penalty is added to the leastsquares loss. An alternative and algorithmic approach to regularization is based on early
stopping of an iterative algorithm, such as gradient descent applied to the unregularized
loss function. The main advantage of early stopping for regularization, as compared to
penalized forms, is lower computational complexity.

The idea of early stopping has a fairly lengthy history, dating back to the 1970’s in
the context of the Landweber iteration. For instance, see the paper by Strand (1974) as
well as the subsequent papers (Anderssen and Prenter, 1981; Wahba, 1987). Early stopping
has also been widely used in neural networks (Morgan and Bourlard, 1990), for which
stochastic gradient descent is used to estimate the network parameters. Past work has
provided intuitive arguments for the benefits of early stopping. Roughly speaking, it is
clear that each step of an iterative algorithm will reduce bias but increase variance, so
early stopping ensures the variance of the estimator is not too high. However, prior to
the 1990s, there had been little theoretical justification for these claims. A more recent
line of work has developed a theory for various forms of early stopping, including boosting
algorithms (Bartlett and Traskin, 2007; Buhlmann and Yu, 2003; Freund and Schapire, 1997;
Jiang, 2004; Mason et al., 1999; Yao et al., 2007; Zhang and Yu, 2005), greedy methods
(Barron et al., 2008), gradient descent over reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (Caponneto,
2006; Caponetto and Yao, 2006; Vito et al., 2010; Yao et al., 2007), the conjugate gradient
algorithm (Blanchard and Kramer, 2010), and the power method for eigenvalue computation
(Orecchia and Mahoney, 2011). Most relevant to our work is the paper of Buhlmann and Yu
(2003), who derived optimal mean-squared error bounds for L2 -boosting with early stopping
in the case of fixed design regression. However, these optimal rates are based on an “oracle”
stopping rule, one that cannot be computed based on the data. Thus, their work left open
the following natural question: is there a data-dependent and easily computable stopping
rule that produces a minimax-optimal estimator?
The main contribution of this paper is to answer this question in the affirmative for
a certain class of non-parametric regression problems, in which the underlying regression
function belongs to a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). In this setting, a standard estimator is the method of kernel ridge regression (Wahba, 1990), which minimizes a
weighted sum of the least-squares loss with a squared Hilbert norm penalty as a regularizer.
Instead of a penalized form of regression, we analyze early stopping of an iterative update
that is equivalent to gradient descent on the least-squares loss in an appropriately chosen
coordinate system. By analyzing the mean-squared error of our iterative update, we derive
a data-dependent stopping rule that provides the optimal trade-off between the estimated
bias and variance at each iteration. In particular, our stopping rule is based on the first time
that a running sum of step-sizes after t steps increases above the critical trade-off between
bias and variance. For Sobolev spaces and other types of kernel classes, we show that the
function estimate obtained by this stopping rule achieves minimax-optimal estimation rates
in both the empirical and generalization norms. Importantly, our stopping rule does not
require the use of cross-validation or hold-out data.
In more detail, our first main result (Theorem 1) provides bounds on the squared prediction error for all iterates prior to the stopping time, and a lower bound on the squared
error for all iterations after the stopping time. These bounds are applicable to the case of
fixed design, where as our second main result (Theorem 2) provides similar types of upper
bounds for randomly sampled covariates. These bounds are stated in terms of the squared
L2 (P) norm or generalization error, as opposed to the in-sample prediction error, or equivalently, the L2 (Pn ) seminorm defined by the data. Both of these theorems apply to any
reproducing kernel, and lead to specific predictions for different kernel classes, depending on
their eigendecay. For the case of low rank kernel classes and Sobolev spaces, we prove that
336

Early Stopping and Non-parametric Regression

our stopping rule yields a function estimate that achieves the minimax optimal rate (up
to a constant pre-factor), so that the bounds from our analysis are essentially unimprovable. Our proof is based on a combination of analytic techniques (Buhlmann and Yu, 2003)
with techniques from empirical process theory (van de Geer, 2000). We complement these
theoretical results with simulation studies that compare its performance to other rules, in
particular a method using hold-out data to estimate the risk, as well as a second method
based on Stein’s Unbiased Risk Estimate (SURE). In our experiments for first-order Sobolev
kernels, we find that our stopping rule performs favorably compared to these alternatives,
especially as the sample size grows. In Section 3.4, we provide an explicit link between our
early stopping strategy and the kernel ridge regression estimator.

2. Background and Problem Formulation
We begin by introducing some background on non-parametric regression and reproducing
kernel Hilbert spaces, before turning to a precise formulation of the problem studied in this
paper.
2.1 Non-parametric Regression and Kernel Classes
Suppose that our goal is to use a covariate X ∈ X to predict a real-valued response Y ∈ R.
We do so by using a function f : X → R, where the value f (x) represents our prediction
of Y based on the realization X = x. In terms of mean-squared error, the optimal choice
is the regression function defined by f ∗ (x) : = E[Y | x]. In the problem of non-parametric
regression with random design, we observe n samples of the form {(xi , yi ), i = 1, . . . , n},
each drawn independently from some joint distribution on the Cartesian product X × R,
and our goal is to estimate the regression function f ∗ . Equivalently, we observe samples of
the form
yi = f ∗ (xi ) + wi ,

for i = 1, 2, . . . , n,

where wi : = yi − f ∗ (xi ) are independent zero-mean noise random variables. Throughout
this paper, we assume that the random variables wi are sub-Gaussian with parameter σ,
meaning that
2 σ 2 /2

E[etwi ] ≤ et

for all t ∈ R.

For instance, this sub-Gaussian condition is satisfied for normal variates wi ∼ N (0, σ 2 ), but
it also holds for various non-Gaussian random variables. Parts of our analysis also apply
to the fixed design setting, in which we condition on a particular realization {xi }ni=1 of the
covariates.
In order to estimate the regression function, we make use of the machinery of reproducing
kernel Hilbert spaces (Aronszajn, 1950; Wahba, 1990; Gu and Zhu, 2001). Using P to denote
the marginal distribution of the covariates, we consider a Hilbert space H ⊂ L2 (P), meaning
a family of functions g : X → R, with g L2 (P) < ∞, and an associated inner product ·, · H
under which H is complete. The space H is a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS)
if there exists a symmetric function K : X × X → R+ such that: (a) for each x ∈ X , the
function K(·, x) belongs to the Hilbert space H, and (b) we have the reproducing relation
337

Raskutti, Wainwright and Yu

f (x) = f, K(·, x) H for all f ∈ H. Any such kernel function must be positive semidefinite.
Moreover, under suitable regularity conditions, Mercer’s theorem (1909) guarantees that
the kernel has an eigen-expansion of the form
∞

K(x, x ) =

λk φk (x)φk (x ),
k=1

where λ1 ≥ λ2 ≥ λ3 ≥ . . . ≥ 0 are a non-negative sequence of eigenvalues, and {φk }∞
k=1
are the associated eigenfunctions, taken to be orthonormal in L2 (P). The decay rate of the
eigenvalues will play a crucial role in our analysis.
Since the eigenfunctions {φk }∞
k=1 form
√ an orthonormal basis, any function f ∈ H has
an expansion of the form f (x) = ∞
k=1 λk ak φk (x), where for all k such that λk > 0, the

functions in H—where f = k=1 λk ak φk and g = k=1 λk bk φk —are two distinct inner
products.
The first is the usual inner product in the space L2 (P)—namely,
f, g L2 (P) : = X f (x)g(x) d P(x). By Parseval’s theorem, it has an equivalent representation
in terms of the rescaled expansion coefficients and kernel eigenvalues—that is,

The class of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces contains many interesting classes that are
widely used in practice, including polynomials of degree d, Sobolev spaces of varying smoothness, and Gaussian kernels. For more background and examples on reproducing kernel
Hilbert spaces, we refer the reader to various standard references (Aronszajn, 1950; Saitoh,
1988; Sch¨
olkopf and Smola, 2002; Wahba, 1990; Weinert, 1982).
Throughout this paper, we assume that any function f in the unit ball of the Hilbert
space is uniformly bounded, meaning that there is some constant B < ∞ such that
f

∞

: = sup |f (x)| ≤ B

for all f ∈ BH (1).

Early Stopping and Non-parametric Regression

This boundedness condition (1) is satisfied for any RKHS with a kernel such that
supx∈X K(x, x) ≤ B. Kernels of this type include the Gaussian and Laplacian kernels,
the kernels underlying Sobolev and other spline classes, as well as as well as any trace
class kernel with trignometric eigenfunctions. The boundedness condition (1) is quite standard in non-asymptotic analysis of non-parametric regression procedures (e.g., van de Geer,
2000). We study non-parametric regression when the unknown function f ∗ is viewed as
fixed, meaning that no prior is imposed on the function space.
2.2 Gradient Update Equation
We now turn to the form of the gradient update that we study in this paper. Given the
samples {(xi , yi )}ni=1 , consider minimizing the least-squares loss function
L(f ) : =

1
2n

n

yi − f (xi )

2

i=1

over some subset of the Hilbert space H. By the representer theorem (Kimeldorf and
Wahba, 1971), it suffices to restrict attention to functions f belonging to the span of the
kernel functions defined on the data points—namely, the span of {K(·, xi ), i = 1, . . . , n}.
Accordingly, we adopt the parameterization
1
f (·) = √
n

n

ωi K(·, xi ),

(2)

i=1

√
for some coefficient vector ω ∈ Rn . Here the rescaling by 1/ n is for later theoretical
convenience.
Our gradient descent procedure is based on a parameterization of the least-squares loss
that involves the empirical kernel matrix K ∈ Rn×n with entries
[K]ij =

1
K(xi , xj )
n

for i, j = 1, 2, . . . , n.

For any positive semidefinite kernel function, this matrix
must be positive semidefinite, and
√
so has a unique symmetric square root denoted by K. By first introducing the convenient
shorthand y1n : = y1 y2 · · · yn ∈ Rn , we can write the least-squares loss in the form
L(ω) =

1 n √
y − nKω 22 .
2n 1

A direct approach would be to perform gradient descent on this form of the least-squares
loss. For our purposes, it turns out to be√ more natural to perform gradient descent in
the transformed co-ordinate system θ = K ω. Some straightforward calculations (see
Appendix A for details) yield that the gradient descent algorithm in this new co-ordinate
system generates a sequence of vectors {θt }∞
t=0 via the recursion

Raskutti, Wainwright and Yu

where {αt }∞
t=0 is a sequence of positive step sizes (to be chosen by the user). We assume
throughout that the gradient descent procedure is initialized with θ0 = 0.
The parameter estimate θt at iteration t defines
√ a function estimate ft in the following
way. We first compute2 the weight vector ω t = K −1 θt , which then defines the function
estimate ft (·) = √1n ni=1 ωit K(·, xi ) as before. In this paper, our goal is to study how

the sequence {ft }∞

corresponds to the usual mean-squared error.
2.3 Overfitting and Early Stopping
In order to illustrate the phenomenon of interest in this paper, we performed some simulations on a simple problem. In particular, we formed n = 100 i.i.d. observations of
the form y = f ∗ (xi ) + wi , where wi ∼ N (0, 1), and using the fixed design xi = i/n for
i = 1, . . . , n. We then implemented the gradient descent update (3) with initialization
θ0 = 0 and constant step sizes αt = 0.25. We performed this experiment with the regression
function f ∗ (x) = |x − 1/2| − 1/2, and two different choices of kernel functions. The kernel
K(x, x ) = min{x, x } on the unit square [0, 1] × [0, 1] generates an RKHS of Lipschitz functions, whereas the Gaussian kernel K(x, x ) = exp(− 12 (x − x )2 ) generates a smoother class
of infinitely differentiable functions.
Figure 1 provides plots of the squared prediction error ft − f ∗ 2n as a function of the
iteration number t. For both kernels, the prediction error decreases fairly rapidly, reaching
a minimum before or around T ≈ 20 iterations, before then beginning to increase. As the
analysis of this paper will clarify, too many iterations lead to fitting the noise in the data
(i.e., the additive perturbations wi ), as opposed to the underlying function f ∗ . In a nutshell,
the goal of this paper is to quantify precisely the meaning of “too many” iterations, and in
a data-dependent and easily computable manner.

3. Main Results and Consequences
In more detail, our main contribution is to formulate a data-dependent stopping rule, meaning a mapping from the data {(xi , yi )}ni=1 to a positive integer T , such that the two forms
of prediction error fT − f ∗ n and fT − f ∗ 2 are minimal. In our formulation of such a

as though a matrix inversion is required to estimate ω t for each t which is computationally intensive.
yn
However, the weights ω t may be computed directly via the iteration ω t+1 = ω t −αt K(ω t − √1n ). However,
the equivalent update (3) is more convenient for our analysis.

stopping rule, two quantities play an important role: first, the running sum of the step sizes
t−1

ηt : =

τ =0

and secondly, the eigenvalues λ1 ≥ λ2 ≥ · · · ≥ λn ≥ 0 of the empirical kernel matrix K
previously defined (2.2). The kernel matrix and hence these eigenvalues are computable
from the data. We also note that there is a large body of work on fast computation of
kernel eigenvalues (e.g., see Drineas and Mahoney, 2005 and references therein).
3.1 Stopping Rules and General Error Bounds
Our stopping rule involves the use of a model complexity measure, familiar from past work
on uniform laws over kernel classes (Bartlett et al., 2005; Koltchinskii, 2006; Mendelson,
2002), known as the local empirical Rademacher complexity. For the kernel classes studied
in this paper, it takes the form

RK (ε) : =

(4)

i=1

For a given noise variance σ > 0, a closely related quantity—one of central importance to
our analysis—is the critical empirical radius εn > 0, defined to be the smallest positive
341

Raskutti, Wainwright and Yu

solution to the inequality
RK (ε) ≤ ε2 /(2eσ).

(5)

The existence and uniqueness of εn is guaranteed for any reproducing kernel Hilbert space;
see Appendix D for details. As clarified in our proof, this inequality plays a key role in
trading off the bias and variance in a kernel regression estimate.
Our stopping rule is defined in terms of an analogous inequality that involves the running
sum ηt = t−1
τ =0 ατ of the step sizes. Throughout this paper, we assume that the step sizes
are chosen to satisfy the following properties:
• Boundedness: 0 ≤ ατ ≤ min{1, 1/λ1 } for all τ = 0, 1, 2, . . ..
• Non-increasing: ατ +1 ≤ ατ for all τ = 0, 1, 2, . . ..
t−1
τ =0 ατ

• Infinite travel: the running sum ηt =

diverges as t → +∞.

We refer to any sequence {ατ }∞
τ =0 that satisfies these conditions as a valid stepsize sequence.
We then define the stopping time
√
T : = arg min t ∈ N | RK 1/ ηt > (2eσηt )−1

− 1.

(6)

As discussed in Appendix D, the integer T belongs to the interval [0, ∞) and is unique
for any valid stepsize sequence. As will be clarified in our proof, the intuition underlying
the stopping rule (6) is that the sum of the step-sizes ηt acts as a tuning parameter that
controls the bias-variance tradeoff. The minimizing value is specified by a fixed point of the
local Rademacher complexity, in a manner analogous to certain calculations in empirical
process theory (van de Geer, 2000; Mendelson, 2002). The stated choice of T optimizes the
bias-variance trade-off.
The following result applies to any sequence {ft }∞
t=0 of function estimates generated by
the gradient iteration (3) with a valid stepsize sequence.
Theorem 1 Given the stopping time T defined by the rule (6) and critical radius εn defined
in Equation (5), there are universal positive constants (c1 , c2 ) such that the following events
hold with probability at least 1 − c1 exp(−c2 nε2n ):

3.1.1 Remarks
Although the bounds (a) and (b) are stated as high probability claims, a simple integration argument can be used to show that the expected mean-squared error (over the noise
variables, with the design fixed) satisfies a bound of the form
E ft − f ∗

2
n

4
e ηt

≤

for all t ≤ T .

To be clear, note that the critical radius εn cannot be made arbitrarily small, since it
must satisfy the defining inequality (5). But as will be clarified in corollaries to follow,
this critical radius is essentially optimal: we show how the bounds in Theorem 1 lead to
minimax-optimal rates for various function classes. The interpretation of Theorem 1 is as
follows: if the sum of the step-sizes ηt remains below the threshold defined by (6), applying
the gradient update (3) reduces the prediction error. Moreover, note that for Hilbert spaces
with a larger kernel complexity, the stopping time T is smaller, since fitting functions in a
larger class incurs a greater risk of overfitting.
Finally, the lower bound (c) shows that for large t, running the iterative algorithm
beyond the optimal stopping point leads to inconsistent estimators for infinite rank kernels.
More concretely, let us suppose that λi > 0 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n. In this case, we have

which converges to 1 as t →. Consequently, part (c) implies that lim inf t→∞ E[ ft − f ∗ 2n ] ≥

4 as t → ∞, thereby showing the inconsistency of the method.
The statement of Theorem 1 is for the case of fixed design points {xi }ni=1 , so that the
probability is taken only over the sub-Gaussian noise variables {wi }ni=1 In the case of random
design point xi ∼ P i.i.d. , we can also provide bounds on generalization error in the form
the L2 (P)-norm ft − f ∗ 2 . In this setting, for the purposes of comparing to minimax lower
bounds, it is also useful to state some results in terms of the population analog of the local
empirical Rademacher complexity (4), namely the quantity

this complexity measure, we define the critical population rate εn to be the smallest positive
solution to the inequality

(8)

(Our choice of the pre-factor 40 is for later theoretical convenience.) In contrast to the
critical empirical rate εn , this quantity is not data-dependent, since it is specified by the
population eigenvalues of kernel operator underlying the RKHS.

Theorem 2 (Random design) Suppose that in addition to the conditions of Theorem 1,
the design variables {xi }ni=1 are sampled i.i.d. according to P and that the population critical
radius εn satisfies inequality (8). Then there are universal constants cj , j = 1, 2, 3 such that
fT − f ∗

2

≤ c3 ε2n

with probability at least 1 − c1 exp(−c2 nε2n ).
Theorems 1 and 2 are general results that apply to any reproducing kernel Hilbert space.
Their proofs involve combination of direct analysis of our iterative update (3), combined
with techniques from empirical process theory and concentration of measure (van de Geer,
2000; Ledoux, 2001); see Section 4 for the details.
It is worthwhile to compare with the past work of Buhlmann and Yu (2003) (hereafter
BY), who also provide some theory for gradient descent, referred to as L2 -boosting in their
paper, but focusing exclusively on the fixed design case. Our theory applies to random as
well as fixed design, and a broader set of stepsize choices. The most significant difference
between Theorem 1 in our paper and Theorem 3 of BY is that we provide a data-dependent
stopping rule, whereas their analysis does not lead to a stopping rule that can be computed
from the data.
3.2 Consequences for Specific Kernel Classes
Let us now illustrate some consequences of our general theory for special choices of kernels
that are of interest in practice.
3.2.1 Kernels with Polynomial Eigendecay
We begin with the class of RKHSs whose eigenvalues satisfy a polynomial decay condition,
meaning that
λk ≤ C

1
k

2β

for some β > 1/2 and constant C.

(9)

Among other examples, this type of scaling covers various types of Sobolev spaces, consisting
of functions with β derivatives (Birman and Solomjak, 1967; Gu, 2002). As a very special
case, the first-order Sobolev kernel K(x, x ) = min{x, x } on the unit square [0, 1] × [0, 1]
generates an RKHS of functions that are differentiable almost everywhere, given by
1

(f (x))2 dx < ∞ ,

H : = f : [0, 1] → R | f (0) = 0,

(10)

0

For the uniform measure on [0, 1], this class exhibits polynomial eigendecay (9) with β = 1.
For any class that satisfies the polynomial decay condition, we have the following corollary:
Corollary 3 Suppose that in addition to the assumptions of Theorem 2, the kernel class
H satisfies the polynomial eigenvalue decay (9) for some parameter β > 1/2. Then there is
a universal constant c5 such that
E fT − f ∗ 22 ] ≤ c5

is of the order O(n 2β+1 ). By known results on non-parametric regression (Stone, 1985;
Yang and Barron, 1999), the error bound (11) is minimax-optimal.

where xi = i/n, and wi ∼ N (0, σ 2 ) are i.i.d. noise terms. We present results for the
function f ∗ (x) = |x − 1/2| − 1/2, a piecewise linear function belonging to the first-order
Sobelev class. For all our experiments, the noise variance σ 2 was set to one, but so as to
have a data-dependent method, this knowledge was not provided to the estimator. There
is a large body of work on estimating the noise variance σ 2 in non-parametric regression.
For our simulations, we use a simple method due to Hall and Marron (1990). They proved
that their estimator is ratio consistent, which is sufficient for our purposes.
For a range of sample sizes n between 10 and 300, we performed the updates (3) with
constant stepsize α = 0.25, stopping at the specified time T . For each sample size, we performed 10, 000 independent trials, and averaged the resulting prediction errors. In panel (a)
of Figure 2, we plot the mean-squared error versus the sample size, which shows consistency
of the method. The bound (12) makes a more specific prediction: the mean-squared error
raised to the power −3/2 should scale linearly with the sample size. As shown in panel (b) of
Figure 2, the simulation results do indeed reveal this predicted linear relationship. We also
performed the same experiments for the case of randomly drawn designs xi ∼ Unif(0, 1).
In this case, we observed similar results, but with more trials required to average out the
additional randomness in the design.
3.2.2 Finite Rank Kernels
We now turn to the class of RKHSs based on finite-rank kernels, meaning that there is some
finite integer m < ∞ such that λj = 0 for all j ≥ m + 1. For instance, the kernel function
K(x, x ) = (1 + xx )2 is a finite rank kernel with m = 2, and it generates the RKHS of all
quadratic functions. More generally, for any integer d ≥ 2, the kernel K(x, x ) = (1 + xx )d
generates the RKHS of all polynomials with degree at most d. For any such kernel, we have
the following corollary:
Corollary 4 If, in addition to the conditions of Theorem 2, the kernel has finite rank m,
then

fact follows as a consequence of more general lower bounds due to Raskutti et al. (2012).

3.3 Comparison with Other Stopping Rules
In this section, we provide a comparison of our stopping rule to two other stopping rules,
as well as a oracle method that involves knowledge of f ∗ , and so cannot be computed in
practice.
3.3.1 Hold-out Method
We begin by comparing to a simple hold-out method that performs gradient descent using
50% of the data, and uses the other 50% of the data to estimate the risk. In more detail,
assuming that the sample size is even for simplicity, we split the full data set {xi }ni=1 into two
equally sized subsets Str and Ste . The data indexed by the training set Str is used to estimate
the function ftr,t using the gradient descent update (3). At each iteration t = 0, 1, 2, . . .,
2
the data indexed by Ste is used to estimate the risk via RHO (ft ) = n1 i∈Ste yi − ftr,t (xi ) ,
which defines the stopping rule
THO : = arg min t ∈ N | RHO (ftr, t+1 ) > RHO (ftr,t ) − 1.

(14)

Early Stopping and Non-parametric Regression

A line of past work (Yao et al., 2007; Bauer et al., 2007; Caponneto, 2006; Caponetto and
Yao, 2006, 2010; Vito et al., 2010) has analyzed stopping rules based on this type of hold-out
rule. For instance, Caponneto (2006) analyzes a hold-out method, and shows that it yields
rates that are optimal for Sobolev spaces with β ≤ 1 but not in general. A major drawback
of using a hold-out rule is that it “wastes” a constant fraction of the data, thereby leading
to inflated mean-squared error.
3.3.2 SURE Method
Alternatively, we can use Stein’s Unbiased Risk estimate (SURE) to define another stopping
rule. Gradient descent is based on the shrinkage matrix S˜t = t−1
τ =0 (I − ατ K). Based on
this fact, it can be shown that the SURE estimator (Stein, 1981) takes the form
RSU (ft ) =

1
{nσ 2 + (y1n )T (S˜t )2 y1n − 2σ 2 trace(S˜t )}.
n

This risk estimate can be used to define the associated stopping rule
TSU : = arg min t ∈ N | RSU (ft+1 ) > RSU (ft ) − 1.

(15)

In contrast with hold-out, the SURE stopping rule (15) makes use of all the data. However,
we are not aware of any theoretical guarantees for early stopping based on the SURE rule.
For any valid sequence of stepsizes, it can be shown that both stopping rules (14) and
(15) define a unique stopping time. Note that our stopping rule T based on (6) requires
estimation of both the empirical eigenvalues, and the noise variance σ 2 . In contrast, the
SURE-based rule requires estimation of σ 2 but not the empirical eigenvalues, whereas the
hold-out rule requires no parameters to be estimated, but a percentage of the data is used
to estimate the risk.
3.3.3 Oracle Method
As a third point of reference, we also plot the mean-squared error for an “oracle” method.
It is allowed to base its stopping time on the exact in-sample prediction error ROR (ft ) =
ft − f ∗ 2n , which defines the oracle stopping rule
TOR : = arg min t ∈ N | ROR (ft+1 ) > ROR (ft ) − 1.

(16)

Note that this stopping rule is not computable from the data, since it assumes exact knowledge of the function f ∗ that we are trying to estimate.
In order to compare our stopping rule (6) with these alternatives, we generated i.i.d.
samples from the previously described model (see Equation (13) and the following discussion). We varied the sample size n from 10 to 300, and for each sample size, we performed
M = 10, 000 independent trials (randomizations of the noise variables {wi }ni=1 ), and computed the average of squared prediction error over these M trials.
Figure 3 compares the resulting mean-squared errors of our stopping rule (6), the holdout stopping rule (14), the SURE-based stopping rule (15), and the oracle stopping rule (16).
Panel (a) shows the mean-squared error versus sample size, whereas panel (b) shows the

estimated by averaging over M = 10, 000 independent trials, versus the sample

same curves in terms of logarithm of mean-squared error. Our proposed rule exhibits better
performance than the hold-out and SURE-based rules for sample sizes n larger than 50. On
the flip side, since the construction of our stopping rule is based on the assumption that f ∗
belongs to a known RKHS, it is unclear how robust it would be to model mis-specification.
In contrast, the hold-out and SURE-based stopping rules are generic methods, not based
directly on the RKHS structure, so might be more robust to model mis-specification. Thus,
one interesting direction is to explore the robustness of our stopping rule. On the theoretical front, it would be interesting to determine whether the hold-out and/or SURE-based
stopping rules can be proven to achieve minimax optimal rates for general kernels, as we
have established for our stopping rule.
3.4 Connections to Kernel Ridge Regression
We conclude by presenting an interesting link between our early stopping procedure and
kernel ridge regression. The kernel ridge regression (KRR) estimate is defined as

where ν is the (inverse) regularization parameter. For any ν < ∞, the objective is strongly
convex, so that the KRR solution is unique.
Friedman and Popescu (2004) observed through simulations that the regularization
paths for early stopping of gradient descent and ridge regression are similar, but did not
provide any theoretical explanation of this fact. As an illustration of this empirical phenomenon, Figure 4 compares the prediction error fν − f ∗ 2n of the kernel ridge regression
estimate over the interval ν ∈ [1, 100] versus that of the gradient update (3) over the first
100 iterations. Note that the curves, while not identical, are qualitatively very similar.

From past theoretical work (van de Geer, 2000; Mendelson, 2002), kernel ridge regression
with the appropriate setting of the penalty parameter ν is known to achieve minimaxoptimal error for various kernel classes. These classes include the Sobolev and finite-rank
kernels for which we have previously established that our stopping rule (6) yields optimal
rates. In this section, we provide a theoretical basis for these connections. More precisely,
we prove that if the inverse penalty parameter ν is chosen using the same criterion as
our stopping rule, then the prediction error satisfies the same type of bounds, with ν now
playing the role of the running sum ηt .
Define ν > 0 to be the smallest positive solution to the inequality

Note that apart from a slightly different leading constant, the upper bound (a) is identical to the upper bound in Theorem 1 part (a). The only difference is that the inverse
regularization parameter ν replaces the running sum ηt = t−1
τ =0 ατ . Similarly, part (b) of
Proposition 5 guarantees that the kernel ridge regression (17) has prediction error that is
upper bounded by the empirical critical rate ε2n , as in part (b) of Theorem 1. Let us emphasize that bounds of this type on kernel ridge regression have been derived in past work
(Mendelson, 2002; Zhang, 2005; van de Geer, 2000). The novelty here is that the structure
of our result reveals the intimate connection to early stopping, and in fact, the proofs follow
a parallel thread.
In conjunction, Proposition 5 and Theorem 1 provide a theoretical explanation for why,
as shown in Figure 4, the paths of the gradient descent update (3) and kernel ridge regression estimate (17) are so similar. However, it is important to emphasize that from a
computational point of view, early stopping has certain advantages over kernel ridge regression. In general, solving a quadratic program of the form (17) requires on the order
of O(n3 ) basic operations, and this must be done repeatedly for each new choice of ν. On
the other hand, by its very construction, the iterates of the gradient algorithm correspond
to the desired path of solutions, and each gradient update involves multiplication by the
kernel matrix, incurring O(n2 ) operations.

4. Proofs
We now turn to the proofs of our main results. The main steps in each proof are provided
in the main text, with some of the more technical results deferred to the appendix.
4.1 Proof of Theorem 1
In order to derive upper bounds on the L2 (Pn )-error in Theorem 1, we first rewrite the
gradient update (3) in an alternative form. For each iteration t = 0, 1, 2, . . ., let us introduce
the shorthand
ft (xn1 ) : = ft (x1 ) ft (x2 ) · · ·
350

ft (xn ) ∈ Rn ,

Early Stopping and Non-parametric Regression

corresponding to the n-vector obtained by evaluating the function f t at all design points,
and the short-hand
w : = w1 , w2 , ..., wn ∈ Rn ,
corresponding to the vector of zero mean sub-Gaussian noise random variables. From
Equation (2), we have the relation
1 √
1
f t (xn1 ) = √ K ω t = √
K θt .
n
n
Consequently, by multiplying both sides of the gradient update (3) by
the sequence {ft (xn1 )}∞
t=0 evolves according to the recursion
ft+1 (xn1 ) = ft (xn1 ) − αt K (ft (xn1 ) − y1n ) =

√

K, we find that

In×n − αt K ft (xn1 ) + αt K y1n .

(19)

Since θ0 = 0, the sequence is initialized with f0 (xn1 ) = 0. The recursion (19) lies at the
heart of our analysis.
Letting r = rank(K), the empirical kernel matrix has the eigendecomposition K =
U ΛU T , where U ∈ Rn×n is an orthonormal matrix (satisfying U U T = U T U = In×n ) and
Λ : = diag(λ1 , λ2 , . . . , λr , 0, 0, · · · , 0)
is the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues, augmented with n − r zero eigenvalues as needed. We
then define a sequence of diagonal shrinkage matrices S t as follows:
t−1

St : =

(In×n − ατ Λ) ∈ Rn×n .
τ =0

The matrix S t indicates the extent of shrinkage towards the origin; since 0 ≤ αt ≤
min{1, 1/λ1 } for all iterations t, in the positive semodefinite ordering, we have the sandwich
relation
0

Moreover, the following lemma shows that the L2 (Pn )-error at each iteration can be bounded
in terms of the eigendecomposition and these shrinkage matrices:

In order to complete the proof of the upper bound in Theorem 1, our next step is to
obtain high probability upper bounds on these two terms. We summarize our conclusions
in an additional lemma, and use it to complete the proof of Theorem 1(a) before returning
to prove it.

4.1.1 Bounding the Squared Bias

terms in the definition (20) of Bt2 in term. Applying the upper bound (23) from Lemma 8,
we see that

Similarly, we define a (diagonal) linear operator D : 2 (N) → 2 (N) with entries [D]jj = λj
and [D]jk = 0 for j = k. With these definitions, the vector f (xn1 ) ∈ Rn can be expressed in
terms of some sequence a ∈ 2 (N) in the form
f (xn1 ) = ΦX D1/2 a.
In terms of these quantities, we can write K = n1 ΦX DΦTX . Moreover, as previously noted,
we also have K = U ΛU T where Λ = diag{λ1 , λ2 , . . . , λn }, and U ∈ Rn×n is orthonormal.
Combining the two representations, we conclude that

claim (21).
4.1.2 Controlling the Variance
Let us now prove the bounds (22) on the variance term Vt . (To simplify the proof, we
assume throughout that σ = 1; the general case can be recovered by a simple rescaling
argument). By the definition of Vt , we have

where the final equality uses the definition of RK . Putting together the pieces, we see that

E[Vt ] ≤ 2 ηt RK (1/ ηt )

.

Similarly, using the lower bound in Equation (24), we can show that
E[Vt ] ≥

Our next step is to obtain a bound on the two-sided tail probability P[|Vt −E[Vt ]| ≥ δ], for
which we make use of a result on two-sided deviations for quadratic forms in sub-Gaussian
variables. In particular, consider a random variable of the form Qn = ni,j=1 aij (Zi Zj −

Early Stopping and Non-parametric Regression

E[Zi Zj ]) where {Zi }ni=1 are i.i.d. zero-mean and sub-Gaussian variables (with parameter

4.2 Proof of Theorem 2
This proof is based on the following two steps:
• first, proving that the error fT − f ∗ 2 in the L2 (P) norm is, with high probability,
close to the error in the L2 (Pn ) norm, and
• second, showing the empirical critical radius εn defined in Equation (5) is upper
bounded by the population critical radius εn defined in Equation (8).
Our proof is based on a number of more technical auxiliary lemmas, proved in the
appendices. The first lemma provides a high probability bound on the Hilbert norm of the
estimate fT .
Lemma 9 There exist universal constants c1 and c2 > 0 such that ft
with probability greater than or equal to 1 − c1 exp(−c2 nε2n ).

RKHS, the L2 (P) and L2 (Pn ) norms are uniformly close up to the population critical radius
εn over a Hilbert ball of constant radius:

exist universal constants (c1 , c2 , c3 ) such that for any t ≥ εn , we have

This claim follows from known results on reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (e.g., Lemma
5.16 in the paper van de Geer, 2000 and Theorem 2.1 in the paper Bartlett et al., 2005).
Our final lemma, proved in Appendix E.2, relates the critical empirical radius εn to the
population radius εn :
Lemma 11 There exist constants c1 and c2 such that εn ≤ εn holds with probability at least
1 − c1 exp(−c2 nε2n ).
With these lemmas in hand, the proof of the theorem is straightforward. First, from
Lemma 9, we have fT H ≤ 2 and hence by triangle inequality, fT − f ∗ H ≤ 3 with high
probability as well. Next, applying Lemma 10 with t = εn , we find that
fT − f ∗

with probability greater than 1 − c2 exp(−c3 nε2n ). Finally, applying Lemma 11 yields that
the bound fT − f ∗ 22 ≤ cε2n holds with the claimed probability.

Early Stopping and Non-parametric Regression

4.4 Proof of Proposition 5
We now turn to the proof of our results on the kernel ridge regression estimate (17). The
proof follows a very similar structure to that of Theorem 1. Recall the eigendecomposition
K = U ΛU T of the empirical kernel matrix, and that we use r to denote its rank. For each
ν > 0, we define the ridge shrinkage matrix
Rν : = In×n + νΛ

−1

.

(28)

We then have the following analog of Lemma 7 from the proof of Theorem 1:

Note that Lemma 12 is identical to Lemma 7 with the shrinkage matrices S t replaced by
their analogues Rν . See Appendix C.1 for the proof of this claim.
Our next step is to show that the diagonal elements of the shrinkage matrices Rν are
bounded:
Lemma 13 (Properties of kernel ridge shrinkage) For all indices j ∈ {1, 2, . . . , r},
the diagonal entries Rν satisfy the bounds

. See Appendix C.2 for the proof of this claim. With these lemmas
in place, the remainder of the proof follows as in the proof of Theorem 1.

5. Discussion
In this paper, we have analyzed the early stopping strategy as applied to gradient descent
on the non-parametric least squares loss. Our main contribution was to propose an easily
computable and data-dependent stopping rule, and to provide upper bounds on the empirical L2 (Pn ) error (Theorem 1) and generlization L2 (P) error (Theorem 2). We demonstrate
in Corollaries 3 and 4 that our stopping rule yields minimax optimal rates for both low
rank kernel classes and Sobolev spaces. Our simulation results confirm that our stopping
rule yields theoretically optimal rates of convergence for Lipschitz kernels, and performs favorably in comparison to stopping rules based on hold-out data and Stein’s Unbiased Risk
Estimate. We also showed that early stopping with sum of step-sizes ηt = t−1
k=0 αk has
a regularization path that satisfies almost identical mean-squared error bounds as kernel
ridge regression indexed by penalty parameter ν.
357

Raskutti, Wainwright and Yu

Our analysis and stopping rule may be improved and extended in a number of ways.
First, it would interesting to see how our stopping rule can be adapted to mis-specified
models. As specified, our method relies on computation of the eigenvalues of the kernel
matrix. A stopping rule based on approximate eigenvalue computations, for instance via
some form of sub-sampling (Drineas and Mahoney, 2005), would be interesting to study as
well.

Substituting into the gradient descent update yields the claim (3).

Appendix B. Auxiliary Lemmas for Theorem 1
In this appendix, we collect together the proofs of the lemmas for Theorem 1.
B.1 Proof of Lemma 6
We prove this lemma by analyzing the gradient descent iteration in an alternative coordinate system. In particular, given a vector f t (xn1 ) ∈ Rn and the SVD K = U ΛU T of
the empirical kernel matrix, we define the vector γ t = √1n U T f t (xn1 ). In this new-coordinate
system, our goal is to estimate the vector γ ∗ = √1n U T f ∗ (xn1 ). Recalling the alternative
form (19) of the gradient recursion, some simple algebra yields that the sequence {γ t }∞
t=0
evolves as
w

γ t+1 = γ t + αt Λ √ − αt Λ(γ t − γ ∗ ),

358

Early Stopping and Non-parametric Regression

where w
˜ : = U T w is a rotated noise vector. Since γ 0 = 0, unwrapping this recursion then
yields γ t − γ ∗ = I − S t √w˜n − S t γ ∗ , where we have made use of the previously defined
shrinkage matrices S t . Using the inequality a + b 22 ≤ 2( a 22 + b 22 ), we find that

where the equality uses the fact that λj = 0 for all j ∈ {r + 1, . . . , n}. Finally, the
orthogonality of U implies that γ t − γ ∗ 22 = n1 f t (xn1 ) − f ∗ (xn1 ) 22 , from which the upper
bound (20) follows.

Appendix C. Auxiliary Results for Proposition 5
In this appendix, we prove the auxiliary lemmas used in the proof of Proposition 5 on kernel

C.1 Proof of Lemma 12
By definition of the KRR estimate, we have

K + ν1 I fν (xn1 ) = Ky1n . Consequently, some

straightforward algebra yields the relation
U T fν (xn1 ) = (I − Rν )U T y1n ,
where the shrinkage matrix Rν was previously defined (28). The remainder of the proof
follows using identical steps to the proof of Lemma 6 with S t replaced by Rν .

yields the equivalent expression

Note that ni=1 min −2 λi , 1 is non-increasing in while n 2 is increasing in . Furthermore when = 0, 0 = n 2 < ni=1 min −2 λi , 1 > 0 while for = ∞, ni=1 min ηt λi , 1 <
n 2 , recalling that ηt = t−1
τ =0 ατ . Hence εn exists. Further, RK ( ) is a continuous function
of since it is the sum of n continuous functions, Therefore, the critical radius εn exists, is
unique and satisfies the fixed point equation
RK εn = ε2n /(2eσ).
Finally, we show that the integer T belongs to the interval [0, ∞) and is unique for any
valid sequence of step-sizes. Be the definition of T given by the stopping rule (6) and εn ,
we have η 1 ≤ ε2n ≤ η1 . Since η0 = 0 and ηt → ∞ as t → ∞ and εn ∈ (0, ∞), there exists

a unique stopping point T in the interval [0, ∞).
