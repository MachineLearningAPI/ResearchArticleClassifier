Abstract
We present a method whereby a robot can learn to recognize places with high accuracy, in spite of perceptual aliasing (different places appear the same) and image variability
(the same place appears differently). The first step in learning place recognition restricts attention to distinctive states
identified by the map-learning algorithm, and eliminates image variability by unsupervised learning of clusters of similar sensory images. The clusters define views associated
with distinctive states, often increasing perceptual aliasing.
The second step eliminates perceptual aliasing by building a
causal/topological map and using history information gathered during exploration to disambiguate distinctive states.
The third step uses the labeled images for supervised learning of direct associations from sensory images to distinctive
states. We evaluate the method using a physical mobile robot
in two environments, showing high recognition rates in spite
of large amounts of perceptual aliasing.

Introduction
It is valuable for a robot to know its position and orientation
with respect to a map of its environment. This allows it to
plan actions and predict their results, using its map.
We define place recognition as identifying the current position and orientation, a task sometimes called “global localization” (Thrun et al. 2001). However, not every location
in the environment is a “place”, deserving of independent
recognition. Humans tend to remember places which are
distinctive, for example by serving as decision points, better
than intermediate points during travel (Lynch 1960). In fact,
Polynesian navigators use distinctive places as representational devices even when they cannot be physically detected,
such as on the open ocean (Hutchins 1995).
Real sensors are imperfect, so important but subtle image
features may be buried in sensor noise. Two complementary
problems stand in the way of reliable place recognition.

Perceptual aliasing: different places may have similar or
identical sensory images.
Image variability: the same position and orientation may
have different sensory images on different occasions, for
example at different times of day.

These two problems trade off against each other. With relatively impoverished sensors (e.g., a sonar ring) many places
have similar images, so the dominant problem is perceptual
aliasing. With richer sensors such as vision or laser rangefinders, discriminating features are more likely to be present
in the image, but so are noise and dynamic changes, so the
dominant problem for recognition becomes image variability. We want to use real sensors in real environments, avoiding assumptions that restrict us to certain types of sensors or
make it difficult to scale up to large, non-simply-connected
environments.
Unique place recognition is not always possible using the
current sensory image alone. If necessary, we will use active exploration to obtain history information to determine
the correct place. However, when subtle features, adequate
for discriminating between different places, are buried in the
noise due to image variability, we want to recover those features.
We build on the Spatial Semantic Hierarchy (SSH) which
provides an abstraction of the continuous environment to a
discrete set of distinctive states (dstates), linked by reliable
actions (Kuipers & Byun 1991; Kuipers 2000). We assume
that the agent has previously learned a set of features and
control laws adequate to provide reliable transitions among a
set of distinctive states in the environment (Pierce & Kuipers
1997).

A Hybrid Solution
The steps in our solution to the place recognition problem
apply several different learning and deductive methods (Figure 1).
1. Restrict attention to recognizing distinctive states
(dstates). Distinctive states are well-separated in the
robot’s state space.
2. Apply an unsupervised clustering algorithm to the sensory
images obtained at the dstates in the environment. This
reduces image variability by mapping different images of

Markov localization has been used effectively by Thrun and
his colleagues (Thrun, Fox, & Burgard 1998; Thrun et al.
2001) to build occupancy grid maps and to localize the robot
in the grid, given observations from range sensors. The central equation for Markov localization is

the same place into the same cluster, even at the cost of
increasing perceptual aliasing by mapping images of different states into the same cluster. We define each cluster
to be a view, in the sense of the SSH (Kuipers 2000).
3. Build the SSH causal and topological maps — symbolic descriptions made up of dstates, views, places,
and paths — by exploration and abduction from the observed sequence of views and actions (Kuipers 2000;
Remolina & Kuipers 2001). This provides an unambiguous assignment of the correct dstate to each experienced
image, which is feedback path (a) in Figure 1.
4. The correct causal/topological map labels each image
with the correct dstate. Apply a supervised learning algorithm to learn a direct association from sensory image
to dstate. The added information in supervised learning
makes it possible to identify subtle discriminating features
that were not distinguishable from noise by the unsupervised clustering algorithm. This is feedback path (b) in
Figure 1.
We call this bootstrap learning because of the way a weak
learning method (clustering) provides the prerequisites for
a deductive method (map-building), which in turn provides
the labels required by a stronger supervised learning method
(nearest neighbor), which can finally achieve high performance.

which updates the prior probability distribution Ô´Ü Ñµ over

agent, Ô´Ü¼ Ü Ñµ is the action model, and « is a normalizing constant.
The Markov equation (1) applies whether Ñ is an occupancy grid or a topological graph (Basye, Dean, & Kaelbling
1995), and its structure will help us compare the two representations.

Occupancy Grids
The occupancy grid representation has been popular and
successful (Moravec 1988; Thrun, Fox, & Burgard 1998;
Yamauchi, Schultz, & Adams 1998). Although the size of
the occupancy grid grows quadratically with the size of the
environment and the desired spatial resolution of the grid,
this memory cost is feasible for moderate-sized environments, and modern Monte Carlo algorithms (Thrun et al.
2001) make the update computation tractable. Nonetheless,
fundamental drawbacks remain.

¯

The occupancy grid assumes a single global frame of
reference for representing locations in the environment.
When exploring an extended environment, metrical errors
accumulate. Reconciling position estimates after traveling around a circuit requires reasoning with a topological
skeleton of special locations (Thrun et al. 1998).
The occupancy grid representation is designed for rangesensors.1 For a laser range-finder, an observation Ó consists of 180 range measurements Ö at ½Æ intervals around
Ö . The scalar value stored in a cell of
a semicircle: Ó
the grid represents the probability that a range-sensor will
perceive that cell as occupied, making it relatively simple
to define Ô´Ö Ü Ñµ. Deriving a usable value of Ô´Ó Ü Ñµ
is problematic, however.

The topological map representation (i) uses a set of dstates
vastly smaller than an occupancy grid, (ii) does not assume
a single global frame of reference, (iii) does not embed assumptions about the nature of the sensors in the representation, and (iv) clusters images Ó into views Ú giving a natural meaning to Ô´Ú Ü Ñµ. We are particularly interested

Minerva (Thrun et al. 2001, sect. 2.7) used Markov localization with particle filters using visual images from a verticallymounted camera to localize in a “ceiling map.” The ceiling map
can be represented in an occupancy-grid-like structure because of
the way nearby images share content. This trick does not appear to
generalize to forward-facing images.

in a uniform framework for place recognition that will generalize from range-sensors to visual images (cf. (Ulrich &
Nourbakhsh 2000)).

Abstraction to Distinctive States
The Spatial Semantic Hierarchy (Kuipers 2000) builds a
topological map by abstracting the behavior of continuous
control laws in local segments of the environment to a directed graph of distinctive states and actions linking them.
A distinctive state is the isolated fixed-point of a hillclimbing control law. A sequence of control laws taking the
robot from one dstate to the next is abstracted to an action.
Starting at a given distinctive state, there may be a choice
of applicable trajectory-following control laws that can take
the agent to the neighborhood of another distinctive state.
While following the selected trajectory-following control
law, the agent detects a qualitative change indicating the
neighborhood of another distinctive state. It then selects
a hill-climbing control law that brings the agent to an isolated local maximum, which is the destination distinctive
state. The error-correcting properties of the control laws,
especially the hill-climbing step, mean that travel from one
distinctive state to another is reliable, i.e., can be described
as deterministic.
The directed link Ü Ü¼ represents the assertion that
action is the sequence of trajectory-following and hillclimbing control laws that leads deterministically from Ü to
Ü¼ , both distinctive states. The directed graph made up of
these links is called the causal map. The topological map
extends the causal map with places, paths, and regions.
Since actions are deterministic, if the link Ü Ü¼
is in the causal map, then Ô´Ü¼ Ü Ñµ
½, while
Ô´Ü¼¼ Ü Ñµ ¼ for Ü¼¼ Ü¼ . This lets us simplify equation (1) to get

(2)

A topological map represents vastly fewer values of Ü
than an occupancy grid, so evaluating the sum in equation
(2) will be very efficient.
Distinctive states are well-separated in the environment.
Intuition suggests, and our empirical results below demonstrate, that sensory images collected at distinctive states are
well-separated in image space, with the possibility of multiple states sharing the same cluster.
Unfortunately, one can construct counterexamples to
show that this is not guaranteed in general. In particular,
if sensory images are collected at states evenly distributed
through the environment (Yamauchi & Langley 1997; Duckett & Nehmzow 2000), then image variability will dominate
the differences due to separation between states, and wellseparated clusters will not be found in image space. Restricting attention to a one-dimensional manifold or “roadmap”
within the environment (Romero, Morales, & Sucar 2001)
reduces image variability significantly, but not as much as
our focus on distinctive states.

Cluster Images Into Views
A realistic robot will have a rich sensory interface, so the
sensory image Ó is an element of a high-dimensional space,

and Ô´Ó Ü Ñµ is so small as to be meaningless. Therefore,
we cluster sensory images Ó into a small set of clusters,
called views Ú . The views impose a finite structure on the
sensory space, so Ô´Ú Ü Ñµ is meaningful, and in fact can
be estimated with increasing accuracy with increasing experience observing images Ó at position Ü. This lets us transform equation (2) into the more useful:

Ô´Ü¼

Ú Ñµ

« Ô´Ú Ü¼ Ñµ

Ô´Ü Ñµ Ü

Ü¼

(3)
In addition, our place recognition method clusters images
aggressively, to eliminate image variability entirely even at
the cost of increasing perceptual aliasing. That is, for a given
distinctive state Ü, there is a single view Ú such that, for
every sensory image Ó observed at Ü, Ó ¾ Ú . We describe
this situation by the relation Ú Û´Ü Ú µ. This means that
Ô´Ú Ü Ñµ ½ and Ô´Ú¼ Ü Ñµ ¼ for Ú¼ Ú, allowing us
to simplify equation (3) further:

Ô´Ü¼

Ú Ñµ

«

Ô´Ü Ñµ Ü

Ü¼

Ú Û ´ Ü¼ Ú µ

(4)
Intuitively, this means that prior uncertainty in Ô´Ü Ñµ is
carried forward to Ô´Ü¼ Ó Ñµ, except that alternatives are
eliminated if the expected view Ú is not observed. The probability mass associated with that alternative is distributed
across the other cases when the normalization constant «
is recomputed.
Where does prior uncertainty come from, since this process can only decrease it? If the initial problem is global
localization, then initial ignorance of position is reflected in
the distribution Ô´Ü Ñµ. Alternatively, if the robot is exploring and building a map of an unknown environment, then
sometimes it will be at a dstate Ü performing an action
such that Ü Ü¼ is unknown. A view Ú is observed, but the
resulting probability mass must be distributed across dstates
Ü¼ such that Ú Û´Ü¼ Úµ.

How Many Clusters?
We cluster images using -means (Duda, Hart, & Stork
2001), searching for the best value of . We use two different metrics to assess the quality of clustering: one for the
agent to use to select a value of , and one for omniscient
researchers to use to evaluate the agent’s selection.
The decision metric Å uses only information available
½
to the agent, so the agent can select the value of
that maximizes Å . After exploring several alternatives, we
adopted the following formulation of this metric which rewards both tight clusters (the denominator in equation (5))
and clear separation between clusters (the numerator).

The evaluation metric Í uses knowledge of the true dstate
Ü associated with each image Ó to allow the researchers
to assess the quality of each cluster Ú . The agent, however, does not have access to Í . The uncertainty coefficient
Í ´Ú Üµ measures the extent to which knowledge of dstate Ü
predicts the view Ú (Press et al. 1992, pp. 632–635). (Here,

decision metric Å to be the largest for which Í ½.
A Simple Experiment
We begin testing our method in the simplest environment
(Figure 2) with a distinguishing feature (the notch) small
enough to be obscured by image variability.
Lassie is a RWI Magellan robot. It perceives its environment using a laser range-finder: each sensory image Ó is
a point in Ê½ ¼ , representing the ranges to obstacles in the
½ ¼Æ arc in front of the robot. So that the Euclidean distance
metric we use for clustering will emphasize short distances
over long ones, we apply a “reciprocal transform”, replacing
each Ö in Ó with ½ Ö .
Lassie explores a rectangular room (Figure 2) whose only
distinguishing feature is a small notch out of one corner. Image variability arises from position and orientation variation
when Lassie reaches a distinctive state, and from the intrinsic noise in the laser range-finder. Perceptual aliasing arises
from the symmetry of the environment, and the lack of a
compass. The notch is designed to be a distinguishing feature that is small enough to be obscured by image variability.
As Lassie performs clockwise circuits of its environment,
it encounters eight distinctive states, one immediately before and one immediately after the turn at each corner. In
50 circuits of the notched rectangle environment (Figure 2),
Lassie experiences 400 images. Applying the decision metis the
ric (5) of cluster quality, Lassie determines that
clear winner (Figure 3(top)). Figure 3(bottom) shows us that
is also optimal to the evaluation metric.

The notch in the rectangle is clearly being treated as noise
by the clustering algorithm, so diagonally opposite dstates
have the same views. In this environment, the four views
correspond to the following eight dstates.

The problem is to determine the minimal set of distinctive

actions. (Remolina & Kuipers 2001; Remolina 2001) provide a non-monotonic formalization of this problem and the
axioms for the SSH causal and topological maps.
The approach is to assert that a pair of dstates is equal unless the causal or topological map implies that they are unequal. Of course, dstates with different views are unequal.

Ü¼ . Similarly for the other pairs of
that same path, so Ü
diagonally opposite states in Figure 2. Lassie thereby determines that the four views are part of a topological map with
eight dstates, four places, and four paths.
We were fortunate in this case that the prescribed exploration route provided the necessary observations to resolve
the potential ambiguity. In general, it may be necessary
to search actively for the relevant experience, using “homing sequences” from deterministic finite automaton learning (Rivest & Schapire 1989) or the “rehearsal procedure”
(Kuipers & Byun 1991).2

Supervised Learning to Recognize Dstates
With unique identifiers for distinctive states (dstates), the supervised learning step learns to identify the correct dstate
directly from the sensory image with high accuracy. The supervised learning method is the nearest neighbor algorithm
(Duda, Hart, & Stork 2001). During training, images are
represented as points in the sensory space, labeled with their
true dstates. When a test image is queried, the dstate label
on the nearest stored image in the sensory space is proposed,
and the accuracy of this guess is recorded. Figure 6 shows
the rate of correct answers as a function of number of images experienced. In two test environments, accuracy rises
rapidly with experience to 100%.
The purpose of the supervised learning step is to resolve
cases of perceptual aliasing,

Ú Û´Ü½ Úµ Ú Û´Ü¾ Úµ Ü½ Ü¾
by identifying a subtle distinction Ú
Ú½ Ú¾ such that
Ú Û´Ü½ Ú½ µ Ú Û´Ü¾ Ú¾ µ. The effect of this in the

Markov localization framework is that the probability distributions in equation (3) will be sharper and the sets in equations (4) will be smaller.
In general, of course, it is impossible to eliminate every case of perceptual aliasing, since there can be different
dstates whose distinguishing features, if present at all, cannot be discerned by the robot’s sensors. In this case, the
robot must use historical context, via equation (4), to keep
track of its location.

A Natural Office Environment
A natural environment, even an office environment, contains
much more detail than the simplified notched-rectangle environment. To a robot with rich sensors, images at distinctive states are much more distinguishable. Image variability
is the problem, not perceptual aliasing.
Lassie explored the main hallway on the second floor of
Taylor Hall (Figure 4). It collected 240 images from 20 distinctive states. The topological map linking them contained
seven places and four paths. When clustering the images, the

We take comfort from the following qualified endorsement:
“Given a procedure that is guaranteed to uniquely identify a location if it succeeds, and succeeds with high probability, . . . a
Kuipers-style map can be reliably probably almost always usefully
learned . . . ” (Basye, Dean, & Vitter 1997, p. 86).

Figure 4: Taylor Hall, second floor hallway (top). The actual environment is 80 meters long and includes trash cans,
lockers, benches, desks and a portable blackboard. The
causal/topological map (bottom) has 20 dstates, 7 places,
and 4 paths.
decision metric Å had its maximum at
½¼. The evaluation metric Í shows that higher values of could still have
eliminated all image variability (Figure 5). By building the
causal and topological map the robot is able to disambiguate
all twenty distinctive states, even though there are only ten
different views. Given the correct labeling of images with
dstates, the supervised learner reaches high accuracy (Figure 6(b)). In these environments, with rich sensors, perfect
accuracy is achievable because sensory features are present
with the information necessary to determine the dstate correctly, but supervised learning is required to extract that information from natural variation.

Conclusion and Future Work
We have established that bootstrap learning for place recognition can achieve high accuracy with real sensory images
from a physical robot exploring among distinctive states in
real environments. The method starts by eliminating image variability by focusing on distinctive states and doing
unsupervised clustering of images. Then, by building the
causal and topological maps, distinctive states are disambiguated and perceptual aliasing is eliminated. Finally, supervised learning of labeled images achieves high accuracy
direct recognition of distinctive states from sensory images.
In future work, we plan to explore methods for robust
error-recovery during exploration, by falling back from logical inference in the topological map to Markov localization
when low-probability events violate the abstraction underlying the cognitive map. Once further exploration moves
Ô´Ú Ü Ñµ and Ô´Ü¼ Ü Ñµ back to extreme values, the abstraction to a logical representation can be restored.
We are also exploring the use of local metrical maps, restricted to the neighborhoods of distinctive states, to eliminate the need for physical motion of the robot to the actual
location of the locally distinctive state.
The current unsupervised and supervised learning algorithms we use are -means and nearest neighbor. -means
will not scale up to the demands of clustering visual images. We plan to experiment with other algorithms to fill

clustering techniques may be more sensitive to the kinds of
similarities and distinctions present in sensor images. Supervised learning methods like backprop may make it possible
to analyze hidden units to determine which features are critical to the discrimination and which are noise. Using methods like these, it may be possible to discover explanations
for certain aspects of image variability, for example the effect of time of day on visual image illumination.
