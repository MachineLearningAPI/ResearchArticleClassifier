Abstract
This article gives a natural decomposition of the suspension of generalized moment-angle complexes
or partial product spaces which arise as polyhedral product functors described below. The geometrical
decomposition presented here provides structure for the stable homotopy type of these spaces including
spaces appearing in work of Goresky–MacPherson concerning complements of certain subspace arrangements, as well as Davis–Januszkiewicz and Buchstaber–Panov concerning moment-angle complexes. Since
the stable decompositions here are geometric, they provide corresponding homological decompositions for
generalized moment-angle complexes for any homology theory.

1. Introduction
Spaces which now are called (generalized) moment-angle complexes, have been studied by
topologists since the 1960’s thesis of G. Porter [41]. In the 1970’s E.B. Vinberg [47] and in the
late 1980’s S. Lopez de Medrano developed some of their features [33]. In seminal work during
the early 1990’s, M. Davis and J. Januszkiewicz introduced quasi-toric manifolds, a topological
generalization of projective toric varieties which were being studied intensively by algebraic
geometers [14]. They observed that every quasi-toric manifold is the quotient of a moment-angle
complex by the free action of a real torus. The moment-angle complex is denoted Z(K; (D 2 , S 1 ))
where K is a finite simplicial complex, as defined below. The spaces Z(K; (D 2 , S 1 )) are at the
confluence of work of many people. A short introduction to some of these connections is given
next.
Let R denote the ring given by Z, Q, or a finite field. Given K, there is an associated ring
known as the Stanley–Reisner ring of K, defined below, and denoted R[K] here. The ring
R[K] is a quotient of a finitely generated polynomial ring P (K) = R[v1 , . . . , vm ] with generators vi for each vertex of K. M. Hochster, in purely algebraic work, calculated the Tor-modules
TorP (K) (R[K], R) in terms of the full subcomplexes of K [25]. In this work Hochster also produced an algebraic decomposition of these Tor-modules.
Subsequently, and independently, Goresky–MacPherson [22] studied the cohomology of complements of subspace arrangements U (A) and related decompositions of their cohomology.
These spaces included complements of certain coordinate subspace arrangements [22]. A more
direct proof was subsequently given by Ziegler–Zivaljevi´c [50].
Later, as well as independently, Davis and Januszkiewicz introduced manifolds now called
quasi-toric varieties, a topological generalization of projective toric varieties [14]. They proved
that a certain choice of Borel construction for the space Z(K; (D 2 , S 1 )) which they define precisely had cohomology ring given by R[K] for R = Z, the Stanley–Reisner ring of K. These
spaces are now known as the Davis–Januszkiewicz spaces.
Buchstaber and Panov [9] synthesized these different developments by proving that the spaces
Z(K; (D 2 , S 1 )) are strong deformation retracts of complements of certain coordinate subspace
arrangements U (A) appearing earlier in work of Goresky and MacPherson. They also proved

1636

A. Bahri et al. / Advances in Mathematics 225 (2010) 1634–1668

that the cohomology algebra of Z(K; (D 2 , S 1 )) is isomorphic to TorP (K) (Z[K], Z) which had
been considered earlier by Hochster.
Among others who have worked extensively on moment-angle complexes are Notbohm and
Ray [38], Grbic and Theriault [23], Strickland [45], Baskakov [5,6], Buchstaber and Panov [9],
Panov [39], Baskakov, Buchstaber and Panov [7], Buchstaber, Panov and Ray [11], Franz [19,
20], Panov, Ray and Vogt [40] and Kamiyama and Tsukuda [30]. Work in [13,15,16,26,28,29,
32,43,46] is closely related. Applications to robotics are the focus of [24,12]. The direction of
this paper is guided by the development in elegant work of Denham and Suciu [17]. In addition,
generalized moment-angle complexes had been defined earlier in work of Anick [2].
Among the results given here is a natural decomposition for the suspension of the generalized
moment-angle complex, the value of the suspension of the “polyhedral product functor.” Since
the decomposition is geometric, an analogous homological decomposition for a generalized
moment-angle complex applies for any homology theory. This last decomposition specializes
to the homological decompositions in the work of several authors cited above. Furthermore, this
decomposition gives an additive decomposition for the Stanley–Reisner ring of a finite simplicial complex extended to other natural settings and which arises from generalizations of certain
homotopy theoretic results of Porter [41] and Ganea [21]. Descriptions for some of the decompositions below appear in [4]. Extensions of these structures to a simplicial setting as well as to
the structure of ordered, commuting n-tuples in a Lie group G are given in [1].
Generalized moment-angle complexes are given by functors determined by simplicial complexes with values given by subspaces of products of topological spaces. Thus, these may be
regarded as “polyhedral product functors” indexed by abstract simplicial complexes, terminology for which the authors thank William Browder (also the inventor of the name “orbifold”).
The authors thank the referee as well as Peter Landweber for useful suggestions which improved the presentation of this article.
2. Statement of results
In this article, a polyhedron is defined to be the geometric realization of a simplicial complex. Generalized moment-angle complexes can be regarded loosely as a functor from simplicial
complexes with values given by subspaces of products of topological spaces. Thus these may
be regarded as “polyhedral product functors.” Generalized moment-angle complexes are defined
next.
(1) Let (X, A) = {(Xi , Ai , xi )m
i=1 } denote a set of triples of connected CW-complexes with basepoint xi in Ai .
(2) Let K denote an abstract simplicial complex with m vertices labeled by the set [m] =
{1, 2, . . . , m}. Thus, a (k − 1)-simplex σ of K is given by an ordered sequence σ =
(i1 , . . . , ik ) with 1 i1 < · · · < ik m such that if τ ⊂ σ , then τ is a simplex of K. In particular the empty set ∅ is a subset of σ and so it is in K. The set [m] is minimal in the sense
that every i ∈ [m] belongs to at least one simplex of K. The length k of σ is denoted |σ |.
(3) Let [m − 1] denote the abstract simplicial complex given by the power set of [m] =
{1, 2, . . . , m}. Let [m − 1]q denote the subset of the power set of [m] given by all subsets of cardinality at most q + 1. Thus [m − 1]q is the q-skeleton of [m − 1].
Define two functors from the category K of simplicial complexes with morphisms simplicial
maps to the category CW ∗ of connected, based CW-complexes and based continuous maps as
follows.

Definition 2.1. As above, let (X, A) denote the collection {(Xi , Ai , xi )}m
i=1 .
The generalized moment-angle complex or polyhedral product functor determined by (X, A)
and K denoted
Z K; (X, A)
is defined using the functor
D : K → CW ∗
as follows: For every σ in K, let
m

D(σ ) =

Yi ,

where Yi =

i=1

Xi
Ai

if i ∈ σ,
if i ∈ [m] − σ

with D(∅) = A1 × · · · × Am .
The generalized moment-angle complex is
Z K; (X, A) =

D(σ ) = colim D(σ )
σ ∈K

where the colimit is defined by the inclusions, dσ,τ with σ ⊂ τ and D(σ ) is topologized as a
subspace of the product X1 × · · · × Xm . The generalized pointed moment-angle complex is the
underlying space Z(K; (X, A)) with base-point ∗ = (x1 , . . . , xm ) ∈ Z(K; (X, A)).
Note that the definition of Z(K; (X, A)) did not require spaces to be either based or CWcomplexes. In the special case where Xi = X and Ai = A for all 1 i m, it is convenient to
denote the generalized moment-angle complex by Z(K; (X, A)) to coincide with the notation
in [17].
The smash product
X1 ∧ X 2 ∧ · · · ∧ X m
is given by the quotient space (X1 × · · · × Xm )/S(X1 × · · · × Xm ) where S(X1 × · · · × Xm ) is
the subspace of the product with at least one coordinate given by the base-point xj ∈ Xj . Spaces
analogous to generalized moment-angle complexes are given next where products of spaces are
replaced by smash products, a setting in which base-points are required.
Definition 2.2. Given a generalized pointed moment-angle complex Z(K; (X, A)) obtained from
(X, A, ∗), the generalized smash moment-angle complex
Z K; (X, A)
is defined to be the image of Z(K; (X, A)) in the smash product X1 ∧ X2 ∧ · · · ∧ Xm .
The image of D(σ ) in Z(K; (X, A)) is denoted by D(σ ) and is
Y1 ∧ Y2 ∧ · · · ∧ Ym

1638

A. Bahri et al. / Advances in Mathematics 225 (2010) 1634–1668

where
Yi =

Xi
Ai

if i ∈ σ,
if i ∈ [m] − σ.

As in the case of Z(K; (X, A)), note that Z(K; (X, A)) is the colimit obtained from the spaces
D(σ ) with D(σ ) ∩ D(τ ) = D(σ ∩ τ ).
Remark 2.3. The constructions Z(K; (X, A)) and Z(K; (X, A)) are bifunctors, natural for morphisms of (X, A) as well as (X, A, ∗), and for injections in K.
The next example provides elementary cases of moment-angle complexes together with associated toric manifolds.
Example 2.4. Let K denote the simplicial complex given by {{1}, {2}, ∅} with
(Xi , Ai ) = D ni , S ni −1

for i = 1, 2.

(1) The first example is
(Xi , Ai ) = D 2n , S 2n−1

for i = 1, 2

where D 2n is the 2n-disk and S 2n−1 is its boundary sphere. Then
Z K; D 2n , S 2n−1

= D 2n × S 2n−1 ∪ S 2n−1 × D 2n

with the boundary of D 2n × D 2n given by ∂(D 2n × D 2n ) = D 2n × S 2n−1 ∪ S 2n−1 × D 2n so
Z(K; (D 2n , S 2n−1 )) = S 4n−1 .
(2) The second example is (X1 , A1 ) = (D 2 , S 1 ) and (X2 , A2 ) = (D 3 , S 2 ). Then
Z K; (X, A) = D 2 × S 2 ∪ S 1 × D 3 = S 4 .
(3) The third example exhibits the connection to toric manifolds where K is a simplicial
complex with m vertices. Regard (D 2n , S 2n−1 ) as a pair of subspaces of Cn in the standard way with the standard S 1 -action restricting to an action on the pair (D 2n , S 2n−1 ).
Thus T m acts on Z(K ; (D 2n , S 2n−1 )). Specialize to K = K. Notice that the S 1 diagonal subgroup (T 2 ) acts freely on Z(K; (D 2n , S 2n−1 )) = S 4n−1 where the quotient space
S 4n−1 / (T m ) is CP2n−1 , complex projective space of dimension (2n − 1). If n = 1, then
(D 2n , S 2n−1 ) = (D 2 , S 1 ) and
Z K; D 2 , S 1

= S3

is a case related to toric topology. That is, CP1 is the toric manifold quotient by (T 2 ) of
its associated moment-angle complex.
(4) More generally, let K = [m − 1]q be the q-skeleton of the (m − 1)-simplex [m − 1]
consisting of all the simplices of [m − 1] of dimension q. Since
∂ [m − 1] =

[m − 1]m−2 ,

A. Bahri et al. / Advances in Mathematics 225 (2010) 1634–1668

1639

there is a homeomorphism
Z ∂ [m − 1]; D 2n , S 2n−1

→ ∂ D 2n

m

= S 2mn−1 .

Definition 2.5. Consider an ordered sequence I = (i1 , . . . , ik ) with 1
gether with pointed spaces Y1 , . . . , Ym . Then
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)
(5)

i1 < · · · < ik

the length of I is |I | = k,
the notation I ⊆ [m] means I is any increasing subsequence of (1, . . . , m),
Y [m] = Y1 × · · · × Ym ,
Y I = Yi1 × Yi2 × · · · × Yik ,
Y I = Yi1 ∧ · · · ∧ Yik .

Two more conventions are listed next.
(1) The symbol X ∗ Y denotes the join of two topological spaces X and Y . If X and Y are
pointed spaces of the homotopy type of a CW-complex, then X ∗ Y has the homotopy type
of the suspension Σ(X ∧ Y ).
(2) Given the family of pairs (X, A) = {(Xi , Ai )}m
i=1 and I ⊆ [m], define
(XI , AI ) = (Xij , Aij )

j =|I |
j =1

which is the subfamily of (X, A) determined by I .
Standard constructions for simplicial complexes and associated posets are recalled next.
Definition 2.6. Let K denote a simplicial complex with m vertices.
(1) Recall that the empty simplex ∅ is required to be in K.
(2) Given a sequence I = (i1 , . . . , ik ) with 1 i1 < · · · < ik m, define KI ⊆ K to be the full
subcomplex of K consisting of all simplices of K which have all of their vertices in I , that
is KI = {σ ∩ I | σ ∈ K}.
(3) Let |K| denote the geometric realization of the simplicial complex K.
(4) Associated to a simplicial complex K, there is a partially ordered set (poset) K given as follows. A point σ in K corresponds to a simplex σ ∈ K with order given by reverse inclusion
of simplices. Thus σ1 σ2 in K if and only if σ2 ⊆ σ1 in K. The empty simplex ∅ is the
unique maximal element of K.
Let P be a poset with p ∈ P . There are further posets given by
P

p

= {q ∈ P | q

p}

as well as
P<p = {q ∈ P | q < p}.
Thus
K <σ = {τ ∈ K | τ < σ } = {τ ∈ K | τ ⊃ σ, τ = σ }.

On the other hand, given a poset P , there is an associated simplicial complex
order complex of P which is defined as follows.

(P ) called the

Definition 2.7. Given a poset P , the order complex (P ) is the simplicial complex with vertices given by the set of points of P and k-simplices given by the ordered (k + 1)-tuples
(p1 , p2 , . . . , pk+1 ) in P with p1 < p2 < · · · < pk+1 . It follows that (K) = cone(K ) where
K denotes the barycentric subdivision of K.
The following decomposition is well-known [36,27] for which
Σ(X) denotes the reduced suspension of X.

Theorem 2.8. Let (Yi , yi ) be pointed, connected CW-complexes. There is a pointed, natural
homotopy equivalence

where I runs over all the non-empty subsequences of (1, 2, . . . , m). Furthermore, the map H
commutes with colimits.

Recall from Definition 2.5 that (XI , AI ) denotes the subcollection of (X, A) determined by I .
An application of Theorem 2.8 yields the following splitting theorem.
Theorem 2.10. Let K be an abstract simplicial complex with m vertices. Given (X, A) =
{(Xi , Ai )}m
i=1 where (Xi , Ai , xi ) are pointed triples of CW-complexes for which Xi , and Ai are
connected for all i, the homotopy equivalence of Theorem 2.8 induces a natural pointed homotopy equivalence
H : Σ Z K; (X, A)

→Σ

Z KI ; (XI , AI )

.

I ⊆[m]

Remark 2.11. The spaces Z(K; (X, A)) generally do not decompose as a wedge before suspending. One example is given where K is the simplicial complex determined by a square, with
4 vertices and 4 edges, and where Z(K; (D 2 , S 1 )) is S 3 × S 3 .
The next result is a determination of the homotopy type of the Z(K; (X, A)) in case the
inclusions Ai → Xi are null-homotopic for every i ∈ [m].
Theorem 2.12. Let K be an abstract simplicial complex with m vertices and K its associated
poset. Let (X, A) have the property that the inclusion Ai ⊂ Xi is null-homotopic for all i. Then
there is a homotopy equivalence
(K <σ ) ∗ D(σ ).

σ ∈K

This theorem is a generalization of the wedge lemma of Welker, Ziegler and Živaljevi´c in [49],
applied to generalized moment-angle complexes. Substituting Theorem 2.12 in Theorem 2.10
yields the next result.
Theorem 2.13. Let K be an abstract simplicial complex with m vertices and (X, A) have the
property that the inclusion Ai ⊂ Xi is null-homotopic for all i. Then there is a homotopy equivalence
Σ Z K; (X, A)

→Σ

∗ D(σ )

σ ∈KI

Two special cases of Theorem 2.13 are presented next where either (i) the Ai are contractible
for all i or (ii) the Xi are contractible for all i. In the case for which all Ai are contractible, the
decomposition given in Theorem 2.10 has the property that D(σ ) is contractible for all σ = [m].
The one remaining summand in Theorem 2.10 occurs for σ = [m] and thus D(σ ) = X [m] as
given in Definition 2.5. The next result follows at once.
Theorem 2.14. Let K be an abstract simplicial complex with m vertices and (X, A) have the
property that all the Ai are contractible. Then there is a homotopy equivalence
Z K; (X, A) =

∗
X [m]

if K is not the simplex [m − 1], and
if K is the simplex [m − 1].

Notice that the spaces Z(KI ; (XI , AI )) of Theorem 2.10 are all contractible unless KI is a
simplex of K by Theorem 2.14. The simplices of K have been identified with certain increasing
sequences I ⊆ [m]. Thus, the next result follows immediately from Theorems 2.10 and 2.14.
Theorem 2.15. Let K be an abstract simplicial complex with m vertices and (X, A) have the
property that all the Ai are contractible. Then there is a homotopy equivalence
Σ Z K; (X, A)

→Σ

XI .
I ∈K

In the situation where (Xi , Ai , xi ) = (X, A, x0 ) for all i, the next result follows at once.
Corollary 2.16. If (1) Xi = X and Ai = A for all i are connected CW-complexes with A contractible, and (2) K1 and K2 are simplicial complexes both having m vertices as well as the same
number of simplices in every dimension, then there is a homotopy equivalence
Σ Z K1 ; (X, A)

→ Σ Z K2 ; (X, A) .

Remark 2.17. The condition in Corollary 2.16 that two simplicial complexes K1 and K2 both
have m vertices as well as the same number of simplices in every dimension is the definition of
having the same f -vectors.
Let P (Y ) denote the reduced Poincaré series for a finite, connected CW-complex.

When specialized to (X, A) for which the spaces Xi are contractible, there is a precise identification of I ⊆[m] Z(KI ; (XI , AI )) obtained by appealing to the “Wedge Lemma” in work of
Welker, Ziegler and Živaljevi´c in [49] on homotopy colimits of spaces. The next theorem addresses the case for which all of the Xi are contractible. Recall the join of two spaces X ∗ Y as
well as the notation A [m] = A1 ∧ · · · ∧ Am from Definition 2.5.
Theorem 2.19. Let K be an abstract simplicial complex with m vertices. Let
(X, A) = (Xi , Ai , xi )

m
i=1

denote m choices of triples of pointed CW-complexes for which Xi , and Ai are connected for
all i. If all of the Xi are contractible, then there are homotopy equivalences
Z K; (X, A) → |K| ∗ A [m] → Σ |K| ∧ A [m] .
Since all of the Xi are contractible, all of the D(σ ) are contractible with the possible exception of D(∅) = A1 ∧ · · · ∧ Am . Since the element ∅ is the maximal element under reverse
inclusion in K, the order complex (K <∅ ) is equal to the barycentric subdivision of K, denoted by K . Furthermore, there are homeomorphisms on the level of geometric realizations
| (K)| → |K | → |K|.
Remark 2.20. For the case (X, A) = (D 2 , S 1 ) and K a simplicial complex with m vertices,
David Stone [44] has shown that the homotopy equivalence
Z K; D 2 , S 1

→ Σ m+1 |K|

given by Theorem 2.19 extends to a homeomorphism. He does this by “linearizing” a smash
product of discs using joins. This result may be interpreted as giving, for any simplicial complex
K on m vertices, a model of Σ m+1 |K| inside an m-fold smash product of two-discs which
preserves the combinatorial structure of K in a natural way.
The next result is now a consequence of Theorems 2.10 and 2.19. The result becomes clear
on noticing that whenever I ⊆ [m] corresponds to a simplex in K, then |KI | is contractible.
Theorem 2.21. Let K be an abstract simplicial complex with m vertices and (X, A) have the
property that the Xi are contractible for all i. Then there is a homotopy equivalence

Remark 2.22. An important case of Theorem 2.21 is given by setting Xi equal to the cone on Ai .
Corollary 2.23. Let (Xi , Ai , xi ) denote the triple (D 2 , S 1 , ∗) for all i. Then there are homotopy
equivalences

Remark 2.25.
(1) A simplicial complex K determines the complement of a complex coordinate subspace arrangement as outlined in [9]. This space is Z(K; (C, C∗ )) which has Z(K; (D 2 , S 1 )) as a
strong deformation retract [9]. Similarly, Z(K; (Rn+1 , Rn+1 − {0})) is the complement of
a certain arrangement of real subspaces having Z(K; (D n+1 , S n )) as a strong deformation
retract.
(2) The associated additive decomposition for singular homology given in Corollary 2.23 is
due Goresky and MacPherson [22] via different methods. The work of Hochster [25] in
combination with work of Buchstaber and Panov [9] as described in the Introduction implied
analogous homological decompositions.
(3) In addition, Goresky and MacPherson [22] gave a more general homological decomposition
for complements of complex arrangements which do not follow from the decompositions
above.
(4) The cohomology ring structure for Z(K; (D 2 , S 1 )) does not follow from the above Corollary 2.23. The cohomology ring structure was studied rationally by Buchstaber and Panov
in [9] and integrally by Franz in [18] and [19] as well as Baskakov, Buchstaber and Panov
in [7].
Shifted simplicial complexes are defined next.
Definition 2.26. A simplicial complex K on m vertices is shifted if there exists a labeling of the
vertices by 1 through m such that for any simplex of K, replacing any vertex of that simplex with
a vertex of smaller label and not in that simplex results in a collection which is also a simplex.
For a shifted complex K, the geometric realization of K and every KI is homotopy equivalent
to a wedge of spheres.
The next corollary follows.
Corollary 2.27. If K is a shifted complex, then ΣZ(K; (D n+1 , S n )) is homotopy equivalent to a
wedge of spheres.

Remark 2.28. In the special case for which K is a shifted complex, a stronger result than that
of Corollary 2.27 was proven by Grbic and Theriault [23]. They prove that Z(K; (D 2 , S 1 )) is
homotopy equivalent to a wedge of spheres without suspending.
Let (CX, X) = {(CXi , Xi , xi )}m
i=1 , where CXi denotes the reduced cone on Xi . The theorems
of Porter [41] and Grbic and Theriault [23] support the following.
Conjecture 2.29. If K is a shifted complex, then
Z K; (CX, X)

|KI | ∗ X I

and
I ∈K

are of the same homotopy type.
Denham and Suciu prove an elegant Lemma 2.9 in [17] which relates fibrations and momentangle complexes. That lemma is stated next.
Lemma 2.30. Let p : (E, E ) → (B, B ) be a map of pairs, such that both p : E → B and
p|E : E → B are fibrations, with fibers F and F , respectively. Suppose that either F = F
or B = B . Then the product fibration, p n : E n → B n , restricts to a fibration Z(K; (F, F )) →
Z(K; (E, E )) → Z(K; (B, B )). Moreover, if (F, F ) → (E, E ) → (B, B ) is a relative bundle
(with structure group G), then the above bundle has structure group Gn .
Notice that Lemma 2.30 extends easily to generalized moment-angle complexes as follows
(with details of proof omitted).
Lemma 2.31. Let pi : (Ei , Ei ) → (Bi , Bi ) be a map of pairs, such that p : Ei → Bi and
p|Ei : Ei → Bi are fibrations with fibers Fi and Fi respectively. Let K be a simplicial complex
with m vertices.
(1) If Bi = Bi for all i then, Z(K; (B, B )) = B1 × · · · × Bm .
(2) If Fi = Fi for all i, then Z(K; (F , F )) = F1 × · · · × Fm .
(3) In either of these two cases, the following is a fibration:
Z K; F , F

→ Z K; E, E

→ Z K; B, B

.

Natural consequences of Lemma 2.31 arose earlier in the work of G. Porter [41], T. Ganea [21]
and A. Kurosh [31] as discussed next. Porter considered the cases {(Xi , ∗i , ∗i )}m
i=1 . In this case,
consider the natural filtration of the product X1 × · · · × Xm as defined by G.W. Whitehead with
j th-filtration given by the space
Xi = (y1 , . . . , ym ) | yi = ∗i , the base-point of Xi for at least m − j values of i .

Wj
1 i m

The subspace Wj ( 1 i m Xi ) of the product is precisely a choice of a generalized momentangle complex as follows.

A. Bahri et al. / Advances in Mathematics 225 (2010) 1634–1668

Let
Then

[m − 1]q denote the q-skeleton of

[m − 1], that is

Xi = Z

[m − 1]q = {I ⊂ [m] | |I |

q + 1}.

[m − 1]j −1 ; (X, ∗) .

In this case, Porter’s result gives an identification of the homotopy theoretic fiber of the inclusion
Xi ⊂

Wj

1 i m

a result which follows directly from the classical path-loop fibration over X and Lemma 2.31,
features elucidated next.
Two standard constructions are used here. Recall that the path-space P X of a pointed space
(X, ∗) is the space of pointed continuous maps f : [0, 1] → X with f (0) = ∗, the base-point
of X. The evaluation map
e1 : P X → X
is defined by e1 (f ) = f (1) and is a fibration with fiber ΩX the space of continuous maps
f : [0, 1] → X with f (0) = ∗ = f (1). Observe that there is a fibration of pairs
e

1
(X, ∗).
(ΩX, ΩX) → (P X, ΩX) −→

Next consider the (unreduced) cone CY over a space Y defined as
C(Y ) = [0, 1] × Y/ ≈,
the quotient obtained from the equivalence relation (1, a) ≈ (1, b) for all a, b ∈ Y with equivalence classes denoted [t, y]. Observe that there is a map
κ : X → X × C(P X)
with
κ(x) = x, [0, fx ]
where fx : [0, 1] → X with fx (t) = x. The map κ is evidently a homotopy equivalence.
Consider the pair
X × C(P X), P X
for which P X is the subspace of X × C(P X) given by pairs (f (1), [0, f ]) ∈ X × C(P X).
Observe that there is a fibration of pairs
π ×e

1
(X, X)
C(P X), ΩX → X × C(P X), P X −−X−−→

1646

A. Bahri et al. / Advances in Mathematics 225 (2010) 1634–1668

for which πX : X × C(P X) → X is the natural projection. Also, observe that there is an equivalence of pairs
(X, ∗) → X × C(P X), P X .
Thus by Lemma 2.31, there is a fibration
π ×e

1
Z K; (X, X)
Z K; (P X, ΩX) → Z K; (X × P X, P X) −−X−−→

as well as the associated fibration (up to homotopy)
π ×e

1
Z K; (P X, ΩX) → Z K; (X, ∗) −−X−−→
Z K; (X, X)

a remark recorded as the next corollary. Recall that X [m] denotes the product

m
i=1 Xi .

Corollary 2.32. If all of the Xi are path-connected, the homotopy theoretic fiber of the inclusion
Z(K; (X, ∗)) ⊂ Z(K; (X, X)) is Z(K; (P X, ΩX)). Thus, the homotopy theoretic fiber of the
inclusion Wj (X [m] ) ⊂ X [m] is
Z

[m − 1]j −1 ; (P X, ΩX) .

For a more general version of this result, see [40], Proposition 5.1.
A second theorem of Porter [41] gives the structure of the fiber Z( [m − 1]j −1 ; (P X, ΩX)).
After one suspension, this result also follows from the next theorem given by a decomposition
of the suspension of Z( [m − 1]q−1 ; (CY , Y )) where CY denotes the cone over a connected
CW-complex Y . Let (CY , Y ) = {(CYi , Yi , xi )}m
i=1 be a family of connected, pointed CW-pairs
I
and recall that Y is Yi1 ∧ · · · ∧ Yik if I = (i1 , . . . , ik ). The next result follows from Theorem 2.19.
Theorem 2.33. Let (CY , Y ) = {(CYi , Yi , xi )}m
i=1 be a family of connected, pointed CW-pairs.
Then there is a homotopy equivalence
Σ Z

[m − 1]q ; (CY , Y )

Σ |I |+1 Y I

→Σ
|I |>q+1 tI

where tI is the binomial coefficient

|I |+1
q+1

.

When q = m − 2, Z( [m − 1]m−2 ; (X; ∗)) is the fat wedge Wm−1 (ΠXi ) and the homotopy
fiber is Z( [m − 1]m−2 ; (P X, ΩX)). In this case, it follows that there is a homotopy equivalence
Σ Z

[m − 1]m−2 ; (P X, ΩX)

→ Σ(ΩX1 ∗ · · · ∗ ΩXm ).

T. Ganea [21] had identified the homotopy theoretic fiber of the natural inclusion
X∨Y →X×Y
as the join Ω(X) ∗ Ω(Y ) in case X and Y are path-connected, pointed spaces of the homotopy
type of a CW-complex. This example is a special case of the homotopy theoretic fiber for the

A. Bahri et al. / Advances in Mathematics 225 (2010) 1634–1668

1647

inclusion of a generalized moment-angle complex in a product corresponding to the simplicial
complex K given by two disjoint points.
For the case that each Ai is contractible, the next result gives a determination of the cohomology ring of Z(K; (X, A)) under certain conditions.
Definition 2.34. Let R be a ring.
(1) A finite set of spaces X1 , . . . , Xm is said to satisfy the strong form of the Künneth theorem
over R provided that the natural map
H ∗ (Xij ; R) → H ∗ (Xi1 × · · · × Xik ; R)
1 j

k

is an isomorphism for every sequence of integers 1 i1 < i2 < · · · < ik m.
(2) A finite set of path-connected spaces X1 , . . . , Xm is said to satisfy the strong smash form of
the Künneth theorem over R provided that the natural map
H ∗ (Xij ; R) → H ∗ (Xi1 ∧ · · · ∧ Xik ; R)
1 j

k

is an isomorphism for every sequence of integers 1

i1 < i2 < · · · < ik

m.

Observe that if a finite set of path-connected spaces X1 , . . . , Xm satisfies the strong form of
the Künneth theorem over R, then they satisfy the strong smash form of the Künneth theorem
over R. A similar result holds for any cohomology theory. Examples in the case R = Z are given
by spaces Xi of finite type which have torsion-free cohomology over Z.
Notice that there is a natural inclusion j : Z(K; (X, A)) ⊂ m
i=1 Xi . Theorem 2.15 implies
that
j∗ :H∗

Xi ; R → H ∗ Z K; (X, A) ; R

is onto and that the kernel of j ∗ is defined to be the generalized Stanley–Reisner ideal I (K)
which is generated by all elements xj1 ⊗ xj2 ⊗ · · · ⊗ xjl for which xjt ∈ H ∗ (Xjt ; R) and the
sequence J = (j1 , . . . , jl ) is not a simplex of K. This construction provides a useful extension
of the Stanley–Reisner ring [14] as stated next.
Theorem 2.35. Let K be an abstract simplicial complex with m vertices and let
(X, A) = (Xi , Ai , xi )

m
i=1

be m pointed, connected CW-pairs. If all of the Ai are contractible and coefficients are taken in a
ring R for which the spaces X1 , . . . , Xm satisfy the strong form of the Künneth theorem over R,
then there is an isomorphism of algebras
m
i=1

H ∗ (Xi ; R)/I (K) → H ∗ Z K; (X, A) ; R .

Furthermore, there are isomorphisms of underlying abelian groups given by
E ∗ Z K; (X, A)

E ∗ XI

→
I ∈K

for any reduced cohomology theory E ∗ .
Remark 2.36. An analogous result for the cohomology ring structure holds for any cohomology
theory E ∗ (−) for which X1 , . . . , Xm satisfy the analog of the strong form of the Künneth theorem
with respect to E ∗ (−) [3].
Denham and Suciu [17] consider an action of a topological group G on the pair (X, A) together with the natural induced action of Gm on Z(K; (X, A)) where K has m vertices. The
associated Borel construction (homotopy orbit space) is
EGm ×Gm Z K; (X, A) .
The applications here will be restricted to topological groups G which are CW-complexes. Regard G as a subspace of EG given by the orbit of a point corresponding to the identity in G.
Denham and Suciu proved the following using their Lemma 2.10 [17].
Theorem 2.37. The space Z(K; (BG, ∗)) is homotopy equivalent to the homotopy orbit space
EGm ×Gm Z K; (EG, G) .
Furthermore, the natural projection
EGm ×Gm Z K; (EG, G) → BGm
is a fibration with fiber
Z K; (EG, G) .
Recall the T m -action on Z(K; (D 2 , S 1 )) induced by the natural S 1 -action on the pair
(D 2 , S 1 ).
Definition 2.38. Define the Davis–Januszkiewicz space
DJ (K) = ET m ×T m Z K; D 2 , S 1

≈ Z K; BS 1 , ∗ .

The space DJ (K) is an example of the construction addressed above by Denham and
Suciu [17]. The cohomology ring of DJ (K) was computed first in work of Davis and
Januszkiewicz [14] as well as work of Buchstaber and Panov [9]. An elegant proof was given
in work of Denham and Suciu [17].
To state their results, let I = (i1 , . . . , ik ) denote a simplex in [m − 1]. Then, let xI =
xi1 . . . xik for which the xi , 1 i m, are the natural choice of algebra generators for the integral cohomology ring of BT m .

A. Bahri et al. / Advances in Mathematics 225 (2010) 1634–1668

1649

Theorem 2.39. The integral cohomology ring of the Davis–Januszkiewicz space
DJ (K) = Z K; BS 1 , ∗
is isomorphic as an algebra to
Z[x1 , . . . , xm ]/I (K)
where I (K) denotes the ideal generated by the elements xI = xi1 . . . xik for which I = (i1 , . . . , ik )
is not a simplex in K. In particular, Z[x1 , . . . , xm ]/I (K) is the Stanley–Reisner ring of K.
Remark 2.40. Theorem 2.39 is a special case of Theorem 2.35 where (Xi , xi ) = (BS 1 , ∗).
The decompositions for the suspensions of generalized moment-angle complexes given in
Theorem 2.10 specialize to decompositions for Z(K; (BG, ∗)) as follows.
Corollary 2.41. There is a homotopy equivalence
Σ Z K; (BG, ∗)

→Σ

Z KI ; (BG, ∗)

.

I ⊆[m]

Thus in case G = T = S 1 , there is an additive decomposition of the Stanley–Reisner ring given
by the cohomology algebra of DJ (K) = ET m ×T m Z(K; (D 2 , S 1 )) together with an isomorphism of underlying abelian groups
I

H i DJ (K); Z → H i

BS 1 ; Z .
I ∈K

Furthermore, there is an isomorphism
E∗ DJ (K); Z → E∗

BS 1

for any homology theory E∗ .
Remark 2.42. An analogous algebraic decomposition was given by Björner and Sarkaria in [8]
for the special case of (D 2 , S 1 ) and singular cohomology with integer coefficients. The decomposition in Theorem 2.35 is also closed with respect to the Steenrod operations in mod-p
cohomology arising from the geometric splitting of the suspension. It is not apparent that the
decomposition of Björner and Sarkaria after reduction mod-p preserves the action of the mod-p
Steenrod algebra.
Some features of generalized moment-angle complexes together with their stable decompositions in Theorem 2.10 extend directly to simplicial spaces X∗ and their geometric realizations
denoted |X∗ |. To do so, some notation is given next by analogy with Definition 2.1.

Definition 2.43. Let (X ∗ , A∗ ) denote the collection of pairs of simplicial spaces
X∗ (i), A∗ (i)

m
i=1

and let (X n , An ) denote the collection of pairs {(Xn (i), An (i))}m
i=1 where Xn (i) denotes the nth
space in X∗ (i). Define
Z K; (X ∗ , A∗ )

n

= Z K; (X n , An ) .

The next lemma gives the property that the collection of spaces Z(K; (X ∗ , A∗ ))n for all n
is naturally a simplicial space which is denoted by Z(K; (X ∗ , A∗ )).

Lemma 2.44. The natural inclusions
in : Z K; (X∗ , A∗ )

n

= Z K; (X n , An ) → Xn (1) × · · · × Xn (m)

are closed with respect to the face and degeneracy operations in the product
X∗ (1) × · · · × X∗ (m).
That is, the following properties are satisfied:
(1) di : Z(K; (X ∗ , A∗ ))n → Z(K; (X ∗ , A∗ ))n−1 and
(2) sj : Z(K; (X ∗ , A∗ ))n → Z(K; (X ∗ , A∗ ))n+1 .
Hence
(1) sj (x) ∈ An+1 (i) if and only if x ∈ An (i), and
(2) the natural inclusion gives a map of simplicial space
i∗ : Z K; (X ∗ , A∗ ) → X∗ (1) × · · · × X∗ (m).
The geometric realization of a simplicial space X∗ is recalled next for convenience of the
reader.
Definition 2.45. The geometric realization |X∗ | is the quotient
[i] × Xi /(∼)
0 i

where

[i] denotes the i-simplex and ∼ is the equivalence relation generated by

(1) (u, di x) ∼ (∂i u, x) for u ∈ [r − 1] and x ∈ Xr , and
(2) (σj (v), y) ∼ (v, sj (x)) for v ∈ [r + 1] and y ∈ Xr .
Let [u, x] in |X∗ | denote the equivalence class of the pair (u, x) in

[r] × Xr .

Given the collection of pairs of simplicial spaces
(X∗ , A∗ ) =

X∗ (i), A∗ (i)

m
,
i=1

let (|X∗ |, |A∗ |) denote the collection of spaces {(|X∗ (i)|, |A∗ (i)|)}m
i=1 where |X∗ (i)| and |A∗ (i)|
denote the respective geometric realizations.
It is a classical fact [37] that there are homeomorphisms
π : X∗ (1) × · · · × X∗ (m) → X∗ (1) × · · · × X∗ (m)
for simplicial spaces X∗ (i) for 1

i

m in case either of the following are satisfied.

(1) Each X∗ (i) is countable, or
(2) the spaces |X∗ (i)| are locally finite.
A variation in the underlying point-set topology is given in [34] where it suffices to assume that
all spaces are compactly generated and weak Hausdorff.
The homeomorphism π is induced by the product of the natural projection maps
πj : X∗ (1) × · · · × X∗ (m) → X∗ (j )
which gives a map
|πj | : X∗ (1) × · · · × X∗ (m) → X∗ (j ) .
The inverse of π = |π1 | × · · · × |πm |
X∗ (i) →

η:
1 i m

X∗ (i)
1 i m

is induced by sending the class of 1 i m |ui , xi | to |w, 1 i m sJi (xi )| where w and the
possibly iterated degeneracies sJi (xi ) are specified in [37].
Since the natural inclusion in : Z(K; (Xn , An )) → Xn (1) × · · · × Xn (m) is a monomorphism
of simplicial spaces by Lemma 2.44, the realization
Z K; (X∗ , A∗ )
is a subspace of |X∗ (1) × · · · × X∗ (m)|. Furthermore, let
i : Z K; |X|∗ , |A|∗

→ X∗ (1) × · · · × X∗ (m)

denote the natural inclusion. The following statement is proven by repeating a proof in [37].

1652

Theorem 2.46. There is a commutative diagram
Z(K; (|X|∗ , |A|∗ ))

h

|X∗ (1)| × · · · × |X∗ (m)|

η

|X∗ (1) × · · · × X∗ (m)|

where h is the restriction of η,
h = η||Z(K;X∗ )| .
Furthermore, if either
(1) the simplicial spaces X∗ (i) are countable,
(2) the spaces |X∗ (i)| are locally finite, or
(3) the spaces Xn (i) are assumed to be compactly generated and weak Hausdorff,
then the map
h : Z K; |X|∗ , |A|∗

→ Z K; (X ∗ , A∗ )

is a homeomorphism.
3. Toric manifolds
This section is a brief introduction to properties of toric manifolds with an emphasis on relationships with moment-angle complexes Z(K; (D 2 , S 1 )). Following Davis and Januszkiewicz
[14] and Buchstaber and Panov [9] define a toric manifold starting with T n the real n-torus
T n = S1 × · · · × S1

(n factors).

Notice that T n acts on Cn , n-space by:
(t1 , . . . , tn ) · (z1 , . . . , zn ) = (t1 z1 , t2 z2 , . . . , tn zn )
where ti zi is the natural multiplication of two complex numbers. The quotient space Cn /T n is
homeomorphic to
Rn+ = (x1 , . . . , xn ) | xi ∈ R, xi

0 .

Let M 2n be a 2n-manifold which has an action of T n . Say that T n acts on M 2n with locally
standard action if (i) every point x ∈ M 2n has a coordinate neighborhood Ux invariant under the
action of T n , (ii) there is a homeomorphism ϕx : Ux → Vx ⊂ R2n = Cn with Vx open, and (iii)
for every t ∈ T n and y ∈ Ux , the following equality
ϕx (t · y) = αx (t) · ϕx (y)

A. Bahri et al. / Advances in Mathematics 225 (2010) 1634–1668

1653

holds, where αx is an automorphism of T n with the standard action on the right-hand side. It
follows that M 2n /T n is the union of spaces Rn+ . Recall that a convex polytope P n of dimension
n is said to be simple if every vertex of P is the intersection of exactly n facets [10]. Say that
M 2n is a toric manifold over P n , if the orbit space is homeomorphic to a simple n-polytope P n
in such a way that the isotropy subgroup is an (n − k)-torus on the inverse image of the interior
of each k-face.
Recall that P n can be described as the intersection of m half-spaces. Notice that P n has faces
of all codimensions from 1 to n. Assume that there are m codimension-1 faces, F1 , . . . , Fm . Each
non-empty intersection Fi0 ∩ · · · ∩ Fik = ∅ for 1 i0 < i1 < · · · < ik is a codimension k-face.
Let σ = (i0 , . . . , ik ) denote an increasing sequence in [m]. Consider the intersection defined
by Fσ = Fi0 ∩ · · · ∩ Fik which will be assumed to be non-empty. Then the set of all such σ
for which Fσ is not empty defines a simplicial complex K (which contains the empty set by
definition). If K contains an element σ which is not the empty sequence, then K is the dual
complex of the boundary complex of the simple convex polytope P n . Moreover, |K| = S n−1 .
Note that this particular K is denoted KP in [14] and [10].
Recall that T n acts on M 2n with isotropy specified below. Let π : M 2n → P n denote the
quotient map. Observe that T n acts on π −1 (Int(Fσ )) with constant isotropy subgroup, denoted
λ(Fσ ), a (k + 1)-subtorus of T n , where k + 1 = |σ | = length of σ and Int(Fσ ) denotes the interior
of Fσ .
In particular T n acts freely on π −1 (Int(P n )). However, T n acting on M 2n has fixed points
which are the inverse images of the vertices of P n . The 1-dimensional tori λ(Fi ) are represented
uniquely up signs in entries of the vector by
λ(Fi ) =

e2πiλi1 , . . . , e2πiλin

for i = 1, . . . , m, where λi = (λi1 , . . . , λin ) is a primitive vector of Zn , that is λi can be extended
to a basis for Zn . Since P n is a simple polytope, every face is given by an unique intersection of
codimension-1 faces. Thus, the vectors (λi1 , . . . , λik ) are linearly independent for k n if Fi is
a face of P n .
Consider the family of codimension-2 submanifolds M(i) = π −1 (Fi ). Define
M(σ ) = M(i0 ) ∩ · · · ∩ M(ik )
where σ = (i0 , . . . , ik ). Since this intersection is transverse, M(σ ) = π −1 (Fσ ) is a codimension2(k + 1) submanifold of M 2n .
The m × n matrix ∧ = (λij ) defines an epimorphism
λ:T m → T n
with the additional property that the group
Tσm = (t1 , . . . , tm ) | ti = 1 if i ∈
/σ
is a natural subgroup of T m and λ|Tσm : Tσm → λ(Fσ ) is an isomorphism. The kernel of λ, denoted
Ker(λ), acts freely on Z(K; (D 2 , S 1 )), where K is the dual of ∂P n and there is a map
Z K; D 2 , S 1 / Ker(λ) → M 2n

1654

A. Bahri et al. / Advances in Mathematics 225 (2010) 1634–1668

which is a homeomorphism. Furthermore, the epimorphism λ : T m → T n is split so that T m is
isomorphic to Ker(λ) × T n as a topological group. A direct consequence is recorded next for use
below.
Lemma 3.1. The induced map
→ ET n ×T n M 2n

ρ : ET m ×T m Z K; D 2 , S 1
is a homeomorphism.

Proof. Observe that λ : T m → T n induces a principal fibration
Ker(λ) → Z K; D 2 , S 1

→ M 2n .

Next, observe that T m splits as T n × Ker(λ) as a topological group. Notice that (i) T m acts on
Z(K; (D 2 , S 1 )), and (ii) the map
Z K; D 2 , S 1 / Ker(λ) → M 2n
is a homeomorphism. Thus T m acts on Z(K; (D 2 , S 1 )) with
ET m ×T m Z K; D 2 , S 1
homeomorphic to
ET n ×T n Z K; D 2 , S 1 / Ker(λ).
The lemma follows.

✷

This setting is clearer with the following equivalent construction of M 2n and Z(K; (D 2 , S 1 ))
due to Davis and Januszkiewicz in [14]. Here, M 2n is the quotient space
T n × P n /∼
where ∼ is the equivalence relation:
(t, x) ∼ t , x

if x = x

and t t −1 ∈ λ(Fσ ),

where Fσ is the unique face such that x ∈ Int(Fσ ). Now Z(K; (D 2 , S 1 )) ≈ T m × P n / ∼, where
∼ is the equivalence relation
(t, x) ∼ t , x
if x = x and t t −1 ∈ Tσm where x lies in the interior of the unique face, Fσ .
Since the map
ρ : ET m ×T m Z K; D 2 , S 1

→ ET n ×T n M 2n

A. Bahri et al. / Advances in Mathematics 225 (2010) 1634–1668

1655

is a homeomorphism by Lemma 3.1, and is equivariant with respect to the natural T m -action, it
follows that there is a morphism of fibrations (up to homotopy) as given next.

One consequence of this diagram of fibrations and earlier remarks is the following theorem
concerning the cohomology of toric manifolds which has been proven in [10] and [13].
Theorem 3.2. The cohomology ring H ∗ (M 2n ; Z) is isomorphic to
Z[x1 , . . . , xm ]/ I (K) + I (λ)
where I (λ) is the ideal generated by π2∗ (H 2 (BT n )).
4. Preparation
The proof given below for the stable decompositions of moment-angle complexes relies on
work of Welker, Ziegler and Živaljevi´c on homotopy colimits of spaces [49]. Relevant features
of that work are recalled next for purposes of exposition.
(1) Let CW ∗ denote the category of CW-complexes and pointed, continuous maps.
(2) Let P denote a finite poset (partially ordered set).
Given a poset P , define a diagram D of CW-complexes over P to be a functor
D : P → CW ∗
so that for every p

p in P there is a map
dpp : D p → D(p)

for which dpp is the identity. Thus, it follows that
dpp ◦ dp p = dpp
when p p p .
The colimit of D is the space
colim(D) =

D(p)/∼
p∈P

1656

A. Bahri et al. / Advances in Mathematics 225 (2010) 1634–1668

for which ∼ denotes the equivalence relation generated by requiring that for each x ∈ D(p ),
x ∼ dpp (x) for every p < p .
Recall the poset associated to a simplicial complex K with order given by reverse inclusion of
simplices and denoted by the symbol K in Definition 2.6. Given a simplicial complex K, there
are two diagrams D and D over the poset K given by D(σ ) and D(σ ) with all the diagram maps
induced by obvious inclusions. It follows that
Z K; (X, A) = colim D(σ )
and
Z K; (X, A) = colim D(σ ) .
Homotopy colimits are defined next using the order complex (P ) as described in the introduction. Given a poset P and p ∈ P , define a new poset given by
P

p

= {q ∈ P | q

The order complex (P p ) is a subcomplex of
sions induce an injection
ip p : (P

p)

(P ). Also, whenever p
→

(P

p

p , the natural inclu-

).

For all p1 < p2 , there are two natural maps α and β determined by ip2 p1 and dp1 p2 given by
α = 1 × dp1 p2 : (P

p1 ) × D(p2 ) →

(P

p1 ) × D(p1 )

β = ip2 p1 × 1 : (P

p1 ) × D(p2 ) →

(P

p2 ) × D(p2 ).

and

The homotopy colimit of a diagram D(P ) is defined as
hocolim D(P ) =

(P

p ) × D(p)

∼

p∈P

where ∼ is the equivalence relation defined by identifying every pair of points α(x, u) and
β(x, u).
The next theorem, a restatement of the ‘Projection Lemma’ stated in [49] as Lemma 3.1 or
in [42] permits replacement of colimits by homotopy colimits in the case of CW-diagrams (in
particular). One feature of this process is that homotopy colimits frequently have more useful
homotopy properties than colimits in the proofs below.
Theorem 4.1. Let D(P ) be a diagram over P having the property that the map
colimq>p D(q) → D(p)

A. Bahri et al. / Advances in Mathematics 225 (2010) 1634–1668

1657

is a closed cofibration. Then the natural projection map
π(D) : hocolim D(P ) → colim D(P )
induced by the projection
(P

p ) × D(p) → D(p)

is a homotopy equivalence.
The last ingredient required here is the next result, proven in [50] as Lemma 1.8, and stated in
[49] as Lemma 4.9 (Wedge Lemma).
Theorem 4.2. Let P be a poset with maximal element m. Let D(P ) be a diagram over P so that
there exist points cp ∈ D(p) for all p < m such that dpp is the constant map with dpp (x) = cp
for all p > p, then there is a homotopy equivalence
(P<p ) ∗ D(p) .

hocolim(D, P ) →
p∈P

An additional result is developed next. Let Σ : CW ∗ → CW ∗ be the suspension functor. By
the definition of colim, if D : P → CW ∗ is a diagram, there is a natural inclusion
h(p) : D(p) → colim D(P )
which induces a map
Σ h(p) : Σ D(p) → Σ colim D(P )
and thus a map
h : colim (Σ ◦ D)(P ) → Σ colim D(P ) .
Theorem 4.3. Let D : P → CW ∗ be a diagram of finite CW-complexes. Then the map
h : colim (Σ ◦ D)(P ) → Σ colim D(P )
is a homotopy equivalence.

1658

A. Bahri et al. / Advances in Mathematics 225 (2010) 1634–1668

Proof. Since homology commutes with finite colimits by a check of the Mayer–Vietoris spectral
sequence, there is a commutative diagram where the vertical maps are isomorphisms:
H∗ (colim((Σ ◦ D)(P )))

h∗

H∗ (Σ(colim(D(P ))))

c

1

colim(H∗ (Σ ◦ D(p)))

H∗ (Σ(colim(D(P ))))
s∗

s∗
∼
=

colim(H∗−1 (D(p)))

H∗−1 (colim(D)).

Here s∗ is the inverse of the suspension isomorphism in homology, and c is the commutation isomorphism. Thus h∗ is an isomorphism in homology. Since colim((Σ ◦ D)(P )) and
Σ(colim(D(P ))) are both 1-connected, J.H.C. Whitehead’s theorem gives that h is a homotopy
equivalence. ✷
The following ‘Homotopy Lemma’ given in [41,48] and [49] is useful in what follows.
Theorem 4.4. Let D and E be two diagrams over P with values in CW ∗ . If f is a map of
diagrams over P such that for every p, fp : D(p) → E(p) is a homotopy equivalence, then f
induces a homotopy equivalence
f¯ : hocolim D(P ) → hocolim E(P ) .
The previous theorem coupled with Theorem 4.1, implies the following corollary.
Corollary 4.5. Let D and E be two diagrams over P with values in CW ∗ for which the maps
colimq>p D(q) → D(p), and colimq>p E(q) → E(p) are closed cofibrations. If f is a map of
diagrams over P such that for every p, fp : D(p) → E(p) is a homotopy equivalence, then f
induces a homotopy equivalence
f : colim D(P ) → colim E(P ) .
5. Proof of Theorem 2.10
Recall the functor D : K → CW ∗ of Definition 2.1 as follows: For every σ in K, let
m

D(σ ) =

Yi ,

where Yi =

i=1

Xi
Ai

if i ∈ σ,
if i ∈ [m] − σ.

Then
Z K; (X, A) =

D(σ ) = colim D(σ ).
σ ∈K

A. Bahri et al. / Advances in Mathematics 225 (2010) 1634–1668

1659

The analogous functor with values in smash products of spaces is given in Definition 2.2 by
D : K → CW ∗ defined by
D(σ ) = Y1 ∧ Y2 ∧ · · · ∧ Ym

where Yi =

Xi
Ai

if i ∈ σ,
if i ∈ [m] − σ.

As in Definition 2.5, let I denote an ordered sequence I = (i1 , . . . , ik ) which satisfies 1
i1 < · · · < ik m. Specialize K to KI , the full subcomplex of K given by
KI = {σ ∩ I | σ ∈ K}.
Associated to KI is the diagram DI : KI → CW ∗ satisfying
DI (σ ∩ I ) = Yi1 ∧ Yi2 ∧ · · · ∧ Yik

Xi
where Yij = A j
ij

if ij ∈ σ ∩ I,
if ij ∈ I − σ ∩ I.

Theorem 2.8 states that there is a natural pointed homotopy equivalence
H : ΣD(σ ) → Σ

DI (σ ∩ I ) .
I ⊆[m]

Definition 5.1. The diagram
E : K → CW ∗
is defined by the values on objects
E(σ ) =

DI (σ ∩ I )
I ⊆[m]

together with naturality.
Observe that the map H of Theorem 2.8 gives a map of diagrams H : ΣD → ΣE which
induces a homotopy equivalence
H : ΣD(σ ) → ΣE(σ )
for every σ . It follows from Corollary 4.5 that there is a homotopy equivalence
H : colim(ΣD) → colim(ΣE).
Theorem 4.3 allows the commutation of the suspension with the colimits giving a homotopy
equivalence
H : Σ colim(D) → Σ colim(E) .

1660

Now,
colim D(σ ) = Z K; (X, A)

and

colim E(σ ) =

Z K; (XI , AI ) ,
I ⊆[m]

thus there is a homotopy equivalence
→Σ

H : Σ Z K; (X, A)

Z KI ; (XI , AI )
I ⊆[m]

which is natural for morphisms of pairs (X, A) and embeddings in K, completing the proof of
Theorem 2.10.
6. Proof of Theorem 2.12
The hypotheses of Theorem 2.12 are that the inclusion maps Ai ⊂ Xi are null-homotopic for
all i.
Definition 6.1. Consider the diagram
D : K → CW ∗ ,
where K is the poset associated to K described in Definition 2.6, defined by
D(σ ) = Y1 ∧ Y2 ∧ · · · ∧ Ym

where Yi =

Xi
Ai

if i ∈ σ,
if i ∈ [m] − σ

with dˆσ,τ : D(τ ) → D(σ ) given by the natural inclusions when σ < τ , that is τ ⊂ σ .
Consider the diagram
i

id
k
Ak −
→
Xk −
→
Xk .

By hypothesis, ik is null-homotopic, so there is a null-homotopy Fk : Ak × I → Xk with
Fk (a, 0) = ik (a) and Fk (a, 1) = xk for all a ∈ Ak .
By the homotopy extension theorem, there exists Gk : Xk × I → Xk with Gk (x, 0) = x,
Gk (x, 1) = gk (x) such that gk (ak ) = xk , the base-point in Xk , for all ak ∈ Ak . Thus there is
a commutative diagram
Ak

id

ck

ik

Xk

Ak

gk

Xk

where ck is the constant map to xk the base-point of Xk .

A. Bahri et al. / Advances in Mathematics 225 (2010) 1634–1668

1661

Definition 6.2. Define a new diagram
E : K → CW ∗
by E(σ ) = D(σ ) with diagram maps eσ,τ : E(τ ) → E(σ ) given by constant maps to base-points.
Next, define maps α(σ ) as follows.
Definition 6.3. For every σ ∈ K, define
α(σ ) : D(σ ) → E(σ )
by α(σ ) = α1 (σ ) ∧ · · · ∧ αm (σ ) where
αk (σ ) =

gk : X k → X k
id : Ak → Ak

if k ∈ σ,
if k ∈ [m] − σ.

Since the gk are homotopy equivalences, so is α(σ ) for all σ ∈ K. Furthermore, if σ < τ (that
is, τ ⊂ σ ), the following diagram commutes:
α(τ )

E(τ )

D(τ )
dˆσ,τ

eσ,τ
α(σ )

D(σ )

E(σ ).

Hence the maps α(σ ) give a map of diagrams
α : D(K) → E(K)
which by Corollary 4.5 gives a homotopy equivalence
α : colim D(K) → colim E(K) .
Finally, Theorem 4.2 gives a homotopy equivalence
(P<p ) ∗ D(p).

colim E(K) →
p∈P

Theorem 2.12 follows since
colim D(K) = Z K; (X, A) .

1662

A. Bahri et al. / Advances in Mathematics 225 (2010) 1634–1668

7. Proof of Theorem 2.19
Let (Xi , Ai , xi ) denote a triple of finite CW-complexes with base-point xi in Ai and with all
Xi contractible for 1 i m. In particular, the inclusions Ai ⊂ Xi are all null-homotopic and
hence Theorem 2.12 applies to this situation. This gives a homotopy equivalence
(K <σ ) ∗ D(σ )

Z K; (X, A) →
σ ∈K

where the diagram D : K → CW ∗ is described in Definition 6.1. Notice now that if D(σ ) contains
an Xi as one of its factors then it is contractible. Hence, the only non-contractible D(σ ) possible
is D(φ) = A [m] . In this case,
(K <φ ) = K
where K is the barycentric subdivision of K. Finally, since |K | and |K| are homeomorphic we
obtain homotopy equivalences
Z K; (X, A) → |K| ∗ A [m] → Σ |K| ∧ A [m]
completing the proof of Theorem 2.19.
8. Proof of Theorem 2.35
Consider the natural inclusion
Z K; (X, A) → X1 × · · · × Xm = X [m]
together with I = (i1 , . . . , it ) for 1 i1 < · · · < it m. Recall the notational convention of
Definition 2.5 that X I = Xi1 ∧ Xi2 ∧ · · · ∧ Xit . Since all Ai are contractible by assumption, apply
Theorems 2.10 and 2.14 to obtain a homotopy equivalence
Σ Z K; (X, A)

→Σ

XI .
I ∈K

By Theorem 2.8, there is a homotopy equivalence
Σ(X1 × · · · × Xm ) → Σ

XI .
I ⊆[m]

Naturality implies that the map
Σ Z K; (X, A)

→ Σ(X1 × · · · × Xm )

is split with cofiber

Next assume that coefficients are taken in a ring R for which the spaces X1 , . . . , Xm satisfy
the strong form of the Künneth theorem over R.
Remark 8.1. One case for which the conditions above are satisfied is given by R = Z and spaces
Xi of finite type with torsion-free integral cohomology.
Thus the reduced cohomology H ∗ (X [m] ; R) is isomorphic to the direct sum
H ∗ (Xi1 ; R) ⊗ · · · ⊗ H ∗ (Xit ; R).
I ⊆[m]

The natural inclusion map Σ(Z(K; (X, A))) → Σ(X1 × · · · × Xm ) induces a map
H ∗ X [m] ; R → H ∗ Z K; (X, A) ; R
which corresponds to the projection map
H ∗ (Xi1 ; R) ⊗ · · · ⊗ H ∗ (Xit ; R) →
I ⊆[m]

H ∗ (Xi1 ; R) ⊗ · · · ⊗ H ∗ (Xit ; R)

H ∗ (Xi1 ; R) ⊗ · · · ⊗ H ∗ (Xit ; R)
I ∈K
/

which is the Stanley–Reisner ideal I (K) by inspection. The last part of Theorem 2.35 follows
by applying the cohomology theory E ∗ to the result of Theorem 2.15.
9. Proof of Theorem 2.46
The first preparatory proof in this section is that of Lemma 2.44 which follows from the
fact that Z(K; (X, A)) is natural for morphisms with respect to morphisms of pairs, (X, A) →
(X , A ).
Proof. The first part of the lemma is to check that
(1) di : Z(K; (X ∗ , A∗ ))n → Z(K; (X, A)∗ )n−1 and
(2) sj : Z(K; (X ∗ , A∗ ))n → Z(K; (X, A)∗ )n+1 .
So it suffices to check that if (x1 , x2 , . . . , xm ) is in the subset
Z K; (X ∗ , A∗ )

n

⊂ Xn (1) × · · · × Xn (m),

1664

A. Bahri et al. / Advances in Mathematics 225 (2010) 1634–1668

then
(1) di (x1 , x2 , . . . , xm ) = (di (x1 ), di (x2 ), . . . , di (xm )) is in Z(K; (X ∗ , A∗ ))n−1 , and
(2) sj (x1 , x2 , . . . , xm ) = (sj (x1 ), sj (x2 ), . . . , sj (xm )) is in Z(K; (X ∗ , A∗ ))n+1 .
Notice that a point (x1 , x2 , . . . , xm ) is in Z(K; (X ∗ , A∗ )) ⊆ Xn (1) × · · · × Xn (m) provided
xt ∈ An (t) for σ ∈ K and t ∈
/ σ . But then di (xt ) ∈ An−1 (t) for t ∈
/ σ as A∗ (t) is a simplicial
subcomplex of X∗ (t) by assumption. Similarly, notice that sj (xt ) is in An+1 (t) if and only if
xt = dj sj (xt ) is in An (t). The lemma follows. ✷
The next proof is that of Theorem 2.46.
Proof. Let |ui , xi | denote the equivalence class of a point in the geometric realization |X∗ (i)|.
The homeomorphism
η : X∗ (1) × · · · × X∗ (m) → X∗ (1) × · · · × X∗ (m)
is induced by η(|u1 , x1 |, . . . , |um , xm |) = |w, sI1 (x1 ), . . . , sIm (xm )| for choices of w and sJi given
in [37,34] as well as in the proof of Theorem 11.5 in [35]. Notice that sIj (xj ) is in A∗ (j ) if and
only if xj is in A∗ (j ) by Lemma 2.44. Thus there is a commutative diagram
h

Z(K; (|X|∗ , |A|∗ ))

|Z(K; (X ∗ , A∗ ))|
|i∗ |

i

|X∗ (1)| × · · · × |X∗ (m)|

η

|X∗ (1) × · · · × X∗ (m)|

as stated in Theorem 2.46.
Since (1) η is a homeomorphism, (2) |i∗ | is a monomorphism, and (3) sIj (xj ) is in A∗ (j ) if
and only if xj is in A∗ (j ), it follows that h is a surjection. Since h is a continuous, bijective, open
map, it is a homeomorphism and the theorem follows. ✷
10. Connection to Kurosh’s theorem
The purpose of this section is to point out that certain fibrations above involving the polyhedral
product functor give natural, useful covering spaces. For example, Ganea’s theorem, a special
case of the Denham–Suciu fibration, implies a statement equivalent to a classical theorem within
group theory due to A. Kurosh [31]. This section is purely expository development of this connection.
Kurosh’s theorem addresses the structure of a free product of discrete groups
Gα .
1 α n

One statement of the theorem is as follows. If G is a subgroup of the free product of discrete
groups A and B, A B, then G is a free product of the following groups:

A. Bahri et al. / Advances in Mathematics 225 (2010) 1634–1668

(1) a subgroup of G conjugate in A
(2) a subgroup of G conjugate in A
(3) a free group.

1665

B to a subgroup of A,
B to a subgroup of B, and/or

The first observation is the following corollary of Kurosh’s theorem.
Proposition 10.1. Let G be a subgroup of the free product A
of A × B with kernel a free group.

B. Then G surjects to a subgroup

The fibration of Denham–Suciu stated here as Lemma 2.30 provides a simple reformulation
of this corollary by inspection as given next. The homotopy fiber of the inclusion
X∨Y →X×Y
is a generalized moment-angle complex which has the homotopy type of the join
Ω(X) ∗ Ω(Y ).
Furthermore, the induced map
W : Ω(X) ∗ Ω(Y ) → X ∨ Y
is the Whitehead product
[EX , EY ]
where EX : ΣΩ(X) → X ∨ Y denotes the composite
e

i

X
X
X −→
X∨Y
ΣΩ(X) −→

with the natural evaluation map eX and with the natural inclusion iX .
Recall that for two pointed topological spaces U and V , each of the homotopy type of a CWcomplex, their join U ∗ V has the homotopy type of the suspension Σ(U ∧ V ). This is applied
next. Consider the case of
X = K(π, 1)

and Y = K(Γ, 1)

for discrete groups π and Γ to obtain
Ω(X) = K(π, 0)

and Ω(Y ) = K(Γ, 0).

Thus Ω(X) ∗ Ω(Y ) has the homotopy type of
Σ (π × Γ )/(π ∨ Γ )
which is a bouquet of circles, one for each pair {(α, β) ∈ π × Γ |α = 1, β = 1}.
The next proposition follows easily.

1666

A. Bahri et al. / Advances in Mathematics 225 (2010) 1634–1668

Proposition 10.2. The kernel of the natural projection map
Γ →π ×Γ

q :π

is the fundamental group of Σ((π × Γ )/(π ∨ Γ )), a free group. Furthermore, the Whitehead
product map W : Ω(X) ∗ Ω(Y ) → X ∨ Y induces the map from π1 (Σ((π × Γ )/(π ∨ Γ ))) →
π Γ which is an isomorphism onto the kernel of the map q : π Γ → π × Γ .
The proof of Proposition 10.1 is given next. Let G be a subgroup of A B. Project to A and
to B, then let the images of G be GA and GB respectively. Define the map
jA : G → A

B

as the composite
γ

i

A
A
G → GA −→
A −→
A

B

where iA and γA are natural inclusions. Define
jB : G → A

B

similarly. Thus the kernel of the natural map
jA × jB : G → GA × GB
is a subgroup of the kernel of
q :A

B → A × B,

a free group.
A standard consequence is recorded next.
Corollary 10.3. Let
f : G1

···

Gn → H

be a group homomorphism which when restricted to each Gi is a monomorphism. Then the kernel
of f is free.
