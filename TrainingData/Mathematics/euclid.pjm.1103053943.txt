SOLVABILITY OF GROUPS OF ODD ORDER
WALTER FEIT AND JOHN G. THOMPSON

CHAPTER I
1. Introduction
The purpose of this paper is to prove the following result:
THEOREM.

All finite groups of odd order are solvable.

Some consequences of this theorem and a discussion of the proof
may be found in [11].
The paper contains six chapters, the first three being of a general
nature. The first section in each of Chapters IV and V summarizes
the results proved in that chapter. These results provide the starting
point of the succeeding chapter. Other than this, there is no cross
reference between Chapters IV, V and VI. The methods used in Chapter
IV are purely group theoretical. The work in Chapter V relies heavily
on the theory of group characters. Chapter VI consists primarily of
a study of generators and relations of a special sort.
2. Notation and Definitions
Most of the following lengthy notation is familiar. Some comes
from a less familiar set of notes of P. Hall [20], while some has arisen
from the present paper. In general, groups and subsets of groups are
denoted by German capitals, while group elements are denoted by
ordinary capitals. Other sets of various kinds are denoted by English
script capitals. All groups considered in this paper are finite, except
when explicitly stated otherwise.
Ordinary lower case letters denote numbers or sometimes elements
of sets other than subsets of the group under consideration. Greek
letters usually denote complex valued functions on groups. However,

a and r are reserved for field automorphisms, permutations or other
mappings, and e is used with or without subscripts to denote a root of
unity. Bold faced letters are used to denote operators on subsets of
groups.
The rational numbers are denoted by &, while <ff* denotes the
field of nth roots of unity over &.
Set theoretic union is denoted by U. If 21 and S3 are sets, 21 — 93
denotes the elements of 21 which are not in S3. 21 c S3 means that 21

In [19], P. Hall studied the stability group 21 of the chain ^ : X =
l o i ^ i • • • 2 Xn = 1, that is, the group of all automorphisms a of
X such that (X^X)" = X<X for all X in X ^ and each i = 1, • • •, n. If
33 and X are subgroups of a larger group, and if S3 normalizes X, we
say that 33 stabilizes & provided 33/ CQ(X) is a subgroup of the stability
group of ^ .
By a character of X we always mean a complex character of X
unless this is precluded by the context. A linear character is a
character of degree one. An integral linear combination of characters
is a linear combination of characters whose coefficients are rational
integers. Such an integral linear combination is called a generalized
character. If S^ is a collection of generalized characters of a group,
let ^(S/*) ( ^ ( ^ ) ) be respectively the set of all integral (complex)
linear combinations of elements in *$". Let ^ ( ^ ) , ^(.5^) be the
subsets of ^P(£S), <&(Sf) respectively consisting of all elements a with
a(l) = 0.
If a and /3 are complex valued class functions on X, then the
inner product and weight are denoted by

II« Hi = <«,«)«The subscript X is dropped in cases where it is clear from the context
which group is involved.
The principal character of X is denoted by l s ; the character of
the regular representation of X is denoted by p^. If a: is a complex
valued class function of a subgroup © of X, then a* denotes the class
function of X induced by a.
The kernel of a character is the kernel of the representation with
the given character.

2. $(0) = £> for every non principal irreducible character 0 of £>.
We say that X is of Frobenius type if and only if the following
conditions are satisfied:
( i ) If § is the maximal normal nilpotent S-subgroup of X, then
(ii) If @ is a complement for £> in X, then @ contains a normal

in [27] is valid for all finite groups, and yields the preceding statement.
3.11. Let 21 and 33 be subgroups of a group X, where 21 is a
p-group and S3 is a pf-group normalized by 21. Suppose 2IX is a subgroup
of 2t which does not centralize S3. / / 33! is a subgroup of S3 of least
order subject to being normalized by 21 and not centralized by 2Ilf then
S3! is a special q-group for some prime q, 2^ acts trivially on D^)
and 2t acts irreducibly on S31/Z7(S31). This statement is a paraphrase
of Theorem C of Hall and Higman [21].
3.12. ([3] Lemma 1). Let A be a nonsingular matrix and let a
be a permutation of the elements of A. Suppose that o(A) can be
derived from A by permuting the columns of A and a(A) can also be
derived from A by permuting the rows of A. Then the number of
rows left fixed by a is equal to the number of columns left fixed by a.
The next two results follow from applying 3.12 to the character

irreducible character of X. Then X{lf ^ | X : 3 |.

Proof.

For ZeS9\ MZ) | = Ml). Therefore

4.2. Let a be a generalized character of the group X.
Suppose that R, X are commuting elements of X and the order of R
is a power of a prime r. Let J^~ be an algebraic number field which
contains the | X |th roots of unity and let x be a prime ideal in the
ring of integers of J^~ which divides r. Then
LEMMA

a(RX) = a(X) (mod x) .
Proof. It is clearly sufficient to prove the result for a generalized
character, and thus for every irreducible character, of the abelian
group <J?, Xy. If a is an irreducible character of <2J, X> then a(RX) =
a(R)a(X) and a(R) = 1 (mod x). This implies the required congruence.
4.3. Let $ be a normal subgroup of the group X and let
X be an irreducible character of X which does not contain !Q in its
kernel. If X e X and C(X) n £ = <1>, then X(X) = 0.
LEMMA

Proof. Let f*u f*2, • • • be all the irreducible characters of X/£> = X.
Let Xu X2, • • • be all the remaining irreducible characters of X. If
C(X) n & = <1>, then C(X) is mapped isomorphically into C(X) where
X is the image of X in X. Consequently

|2 = | C(X) I ^ I C(X) I =
This yields the required result.
Lemma 4.3 is of fundamental importance in this paper.
LEMMA 4.4. Let febe a normal subgroup of the group X. Assume
that if 0 is any nonprindpal irreducible character of § then d* is

784

SOLVABILITY OF GROUPS OF ODD ORDER

a sum of irreducible characters of X, all of which have the same
degree and occur with the same multiplicity in 0*. For any integer
d let £d be the sum of all the irreducible characters of X of degree d
which do not have £> in their kernel. Then fd = ay*, where a is a
rational number and y is a generalized character of §.
Proof. Let Of, 0*, ••• be all the distinct characters of X which
are induced by non principal irreducible characters of £> and which are
sums of irreducible characters of X of degree d. Suppose that Of =
ailjXij, where Xo- is an irreducible character of X for all values of j .
It is easily seen that Of, Of, ••• form a set of pairwise orthogonal
characters. Hence £d = S^l/a^O*. This proves the lemma.
If § is a normal subgroup of the group X, X e X, and <p is a character
of £>, then q>x is defined by <p*(H) = <p(X~lHX),
4.5. Let !Q be a normal subgroup of the group X and let
0 be an irreducible character of £>. Suppose X contains a normal
subgroup Xo such that 3(0) ^ Xo and such that Xo/£> is abelian. Then
0* is a sum of irreducible characters of X which have the same degree
and occur with the same multiplicity in 0*. This common degree
is a multiple of | X : ft(0) |. / / furthermore £> is a S-subgroup of Xo,
then 0* is a sum of | ft(0): £> | distinct irreducible characters of degree
|X:ft(0)|0(l).
LEMMA

Proof. Let 0X be the character of 3(0) = ft induced by 0. Let
X be an irreducible Constituent of 0x and let filf fa, ••-,{*„ be all the
irreducible characters of ft/£>. Choose the notation so that Xfc = X
if and only if 1 ^ i g n. Since 0M§ = \ ft : § |0, we get that X^ = aO
for some integer a. Thus,
(4.1)

S Xfa = a0x .
i

Hence, every irreducible constituent of aOx is of the form Xptj9 so all
irreducible constituents of 0X have the same degree. The characters
f*i, fa, " - form a group 2Ji which permutes the irreducible constituents
of a0x transitively by multiplication. Hence for every value of j there
are exactly n values of i such that Xfrfti = Xfij. If now \ l f X2, • • •, are
the distinct irreducible characters which are constituents of aOu then
(4.1) implies that aOY = nlx{.
Suppose 21 is a complement to § in $, § being a S-subgroup of $ .
We must show that 0Y is a sum of 1211 distinct irreducible characters
of ft. For any subgroups 5^, ^ of ft with § £ ^ s S, and any character
<P of $ r , let qP denote .the character of ® induced by q>.

irreducible characters of 5J, where £> Si St £ 3 . Let 5D?a be the multiplicative group of linear characters of $ which have £> in their kernel,
and let X$ be an irreducible constituent of 0*. Then \ f t (l) = 0(1) is
prime to | 2 I n S | , and it follows from Lemma 4.2 that \ f t does not
vanish on any element of 21 n ® of prime power order. This in turn
implies that

If $ = $, we are done. Otherwise, let 8 contain 5? as a subgroup
of prime index. It suffices to show that \ § is reducible, or equivalently,
that X| = XA for every L in S. This is immediate, since (0®)L = 0®,
so that \ | = XRfi for some /* in 2Jls. Since 2t is abelian, it follows
that ft = 1, as required.
To complete the proof of the lemma (now that the necessary
properties of $ have been established), it suffices to show that if
0x = bliXi ,

where the Xt are distinct irreducible characters of $, then each A,?0 is
irreducible, and xf° ^ xf° for X{ =£ Xjm For if this is proved, the normality
of So in X implies the lemma. The definition of $ implies that Xf^ is
a sum of |3Eo: Qf| distinct irreducible characters of $ . Furthermore, Xt
is the only irreducible constituent of xf.% whose restriction to § is not
orthogonal to 6. Thus, if Xf° — Xj°, then X^ = Xjm Since Xf0 vanishes
outside 3f, a simple computation yields that ||\?°|| a = l. Therefore
\?° is irreducible. The proof is complete.
4.6. Let p be an odd prime and let ^ be a normal Spsubgroup of the group *#&(£. Assume that Jp@ is a Frobenius group with

LEMMA

Proof. £@ is represented on ?P/D(SP). Suppose that §
By 3.16 (iii) @ has a fixed point on ?}//)($), and thus on ?p. This
proves (i). If | B | is not a prime, let l c S f l c B . Then 3.16 (iii) implies
that @0 has a non-cyclic fixed point set on sp//)(^P), and thus on ty.
This proves (ii).
As for (iii), let k be the largest integer such that § has a non
trivial fixed point on Zifc(^P)/ZA;_1(^P). It follows that £> has a non trivial
fixed point on Zk(^)ID(Zk(^)).^ If Zk(%>) is not cyclic then since §@-is

786

SOLVABILITY OF GROUPS OF ODD ORDER

completely reducible on Zk(¥>)ID(Zk($)) (i) implies (iii) by 3.16 (iii).
Suppose that Zk(ty) is cyclic. If k ^ 2, then by [10] Lemma 1.4, ^5 is
cyclic. Since Z2($P) is of class 1 or 2, £?i(Z2($P)) is of exponent p. As
Za(^P) is not cyclic neither is Qx(ZJt$))m Thus it may be assumed that
$P = QX(ZJ$)) is non cyclic of exponent p and class at most 2. If ty
is abelian then (iii) follows from (i). If ^5 is of class 2 then by (i) @
has a fixed point on SP/^P' and on ^5'. As ty has exponent p this implies
that C«p(@) is not cyclic as required.
5. Numerical Results
In this section we state some elementary number theoretical results
and some inequalities. The inequalities can all be proved by the methods
of elementary calculus and their proof is left to the reader.
LEMMA

5.1. If p, q are primes and
p = 1 (mod q) ,

q* = 1 (mod p)

then p = 1 + q + q2.
Proof.

Let p = 1 + nq.

Since p > q,q ^ l(mod p).

Hence

1 + q + q2 = mp .
Reading (mod q) yields m = 1 + rq.

Therefore

l + q + q2 = l + (r + n)q + rnq2 .
If r =£ 0 then the right hand side of the previous equation is strictly
larger than the left hand side. Thus r = 0 as required.
The first statement of the following lemma is proved in [5]. The
second can be proved in a similar manner.
5.2. Let p, q be odd primes and let n ^ 1.
If qm divides (pn - 1) (p*-1 - 1) • • • (p - 1) then qm < pn.
