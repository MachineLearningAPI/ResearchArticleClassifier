The zero forcing number Z(G), which is the minimum number of
vertices in a zero forcing set of a graph G, is used to study the maximum nullity/minimum rank of the family of symmetric matrices
described by G. It is shown that for a connected graph of order
at least two, no vertex is in every zero forcing set. The positive
semideﬁnite zero forcing number Z+ (G) is introduced, and shown
to be equal to |G| − OS(G), where OS(G) is the recently deﬁned
ordered set number that is a lower bound for minimum positive
semideﬁnite rank. The positive semideﬁnite zero forcing number is
applied to the computation of positive semideﬁnite minimum rank
of certain graphs. An example of a graph for which the real positive
symmetric semideﬁnite minimum rank is greater than the complex
Hermitian positive semideﬁnite minimum rank is presented.

Positive semideﬁnite maximum nullity
Positive semideﬁnite minimum rank
Ordered set number

1. Introduction
The minimum rank problem for a (simple) graph asks for the determination of the minimum rank
among all real symmetric matrices with the zero-nonzero pattern of off-diagonal entries described by
a given graph (the diagonal of the matrix is free); the maximum nullity of the graph is the maximum
nullity over the same set of matrices. This problem arose from the study of possible eigenvalues of
real symmetric matrices described by a graph and has received considerable attention over the last
ten years (see [7] and references therein). There has also been considerable interest in the related
positive semideﬁnite minimum rank problem, where the minimum rank is taken over (real or complex
Hermitian) positive semideﬁnite matrices described by a graph (see, for example, [4,6,10,12,13,15]).
Zero forcing sets and the zero forcing number were introduced in [1]. The zero forcing number is
a useful tool for determining the minimum rank of structured families of graphs and small graphs,
and is motivated by simple observations about null vectors of matrices. The zero forcing process is
the same as graph infection used by physicists to study control of quantum systems [5], and the zero
forcing number is becoming a graph parameter of interest in its own right.
A graph G = (VG , EG ) means a simple undirected graph (no loops, no multiple edges) with a ﬁnite
nonempty set of vertices VG and edge set EG (an edge is a two-element subset of vertices). All matrices
discussed are Hermitian; the set of real symmetric n × n matrices is denoted by Sn and the set of
(possibly complex) Hermitian n × n matrices is denoted by Hn . For A ∈ Hn , the graph of A, denoted
by G (A), is the graph with vertices {1, . . . , n} and edges {{i, j} : aij =
/ 0, 1 i < j n}. Note that the
diagonal of A is ignored in determining G (A). The study of minimum rank has focused on real symmetric
matrices (or in some cases, symmetric matrices over a ﬁeld other than the real numbers), whereas
much of the work on positive semideﬁnite minimum rank involves (possibly complex) Hermitian
matrices. Whereas it is well known that using complex Hermitian matrices can result in a lower
minimum rank than using real symmetric matrices, one of the issues in the study of minimum positive
semideﬁnite rank has been whether or not using only real matrices or allowing complex matrices
matters to minimum positive semideﬁnite rank. Example 4.1 below shows that complex Hermitian
positive semideﬁnite minimum rank can be strictly lower than real symmetric positive semideﬁnite
minimum rank.
Let G be a graph. The set of real symmetric matrices described by G is
S (G)

= {A ∈ Sn : G (A) = G}.

The minimum rank of G is
mr(G)

= min{rank A : A ∈ S (G)}

and the maximum nullity of G is
M(G)

= max{null A : A ∈ S (G)}.
Clearly mr(G) + M(G) = |G|, where the order |G| is the number of vertices of G. The set of real positive
semideﬁnite matrices described by G and the set of Hermitian positive semideﬁnite matrices described by
G are, respectively,
S+ (G)= {A

H+ (G)= {A

∈ Sn : G (A) = G and A is positive semideﬁnite}
∈ Hn : G (A) = G and A is positive semideﬁnite}.

The minimum positive semideﬁnite rank of G and minimum Hermitian positive semideﬁnite rank of G are,
respectively,
mrR
+ (G)

= min{rank A : A ∈ S+ (G)} and mrC
+ (G) = min{rank A : A ∈ H+ (G)}.

Clearly mrR
+ (G) + M+ (G) = |G| and mr+ (G) + M+ (G) = |G|. There are a variety of symbols in the
literature (see, for example, [4,15]) for these parameters, including msr(G) and hmr+ (G) for what
R
M(G) and mr(G) mrR
we denote by mrC
+ (G). Clearly M+ (G)
+ (G) for every graph G, and it is well
known that these inequalities can be strict (for example, any tree T that is not a path has mr(T ) <
mrR
+ (T )).
We need some additional graph terminology. The complement of a graph G = (V , E ) is the graph
G = (V , E ), where E consists of all two element sets from V that are not in E. We denote the complete
graph on n vertices by Kn ; a complete graph is also called a clique. The degree of vertex v in graph G is
the number of edges incident with v, and the minimum degree of the vertices of G is denoted by δ(G).
A set of subgraphs of G, each of which is a clique and such that every edge of G is contained in at least
one of these cliques, is called a clique covering of G. The clique covering number of G, denoted by cc(G),
is the smallest number of cliques in a clique covering of G.

Observation 1.1 ([7]). For every graph G, mrR
+ (G)

cc(G), so |G| − cc(G)

MR
+ (G).

For an n × n matrix A and W ⊆ {1, . . . , n}, the principal submatrix A[W ] is the submatrix of A
lying in the rows and columns that have indices in W . For a graph G = (VG , EG ) and W ⊆ VG , the
induced subgraph G[W ] is the graph with vertex set W and edge set {{v, w} ∈ EG : v, w ∈ W }. The
induced subgraph G (A)[W ] of the graph of A is naturally associated with the graph of the the principal
submatrix for W , i.e., G (A[W ]). The subgraph induced by W = VG \W is usually denoted by G − W , or
in the case W is a singleton {v}, by G − v.
The path cover number P(G) of G is the smallest positive integer m such that there are m vertex˙m
disjoint induced paths P1 , . . . , Pm in G that cover all the vertices of G (i.e., VG = ∪
i=1 VPi ). A graph is
planar if it can be drawn in the plane without crossing edges. A graph is outerplanar if it has such a
drawing with a face that contains all vertices. Given two graphs G and H, the Cartesian product of G and
H, denoted G H, is the graph whose vertex set is the Cartesian product of VG and VH , with an edge
between two vertices exactly when they are identical in one coordinate and adjacent in the other.
Let G = (VG , EG ) be a graph. A subset Z ⊆ VG deﬁnes an initial set of black vertices (with all the
vertices not in Z white), called a coloring. There are no constraints on permissible colorings; instead
there are constraints on how new colorings can be derived. The color change rule (for the zero forcing
number) is to change the color of a white vertex w to black if w is the unique white neighbor of a black
vertex u; in this case we say u forces w and write u → w. Given a coloring of G, the derived set is the
set of black vertices obtained by applying the color change rule until no more changes are possible.
A zero forcing set for G is a subset of vertices Z such that if initially the vertices in Z are colored black
and the remaining vertices are colored white, the derived set is VG . The zero forcing number Z(G) is the
minimum of |Z | over all zero forcing sets Z ⊆ VG .
Theorem 1.2 ([1, Proposition 2.4]). For any graph G, M(G)

Z(G).

Suppose S = (v1 , v2 , . . . , vm ) is an ordered subset of vertices from a given graph G. For each k
with 1 k m, let Gk be the subgraph of G induced by {v1 , v2 , . . . , vk }, and let Hk be the connected
component of Gk that contains vk . If for each k, there exists a vertex wk that satisﬁes: wk =
/ vl for l k,
{wk , vk } ∈ E, and {wk , vs } ∈
/ E for all vs in Hk with s =
/ k, then S is called an ordered set of vertices in G,
or an OS-set. As deﬁned in [10], the OS number of a graph G, denoted by OS(G), is the maximum of |S |
over all OS-sets S of G.

In Section 2 we establish several properties of zero forcing, including the non-uniqueness of zero
forcing sets. In Section 3 we introduce the positive semideﬁnite zero forcing number as an upper
bound for maximum positive semideﬁnite nullity, show that the sum of the positive semideﬁnite zero
forcing number and the OS number is the order of the graph, and apply the positive semideﬁnite zero
forcing number to the computation of positive semideﬁnite minimum rank. Section 4 provides the
C
ﬁrst example showing that mrR
+ (G) and mr+ (G) need not be the same (described as unknown in [7]).
2. Properties of the zero forcing number
In this section, we establish several properties of zero forcing, including the non-uniqueness of
zero forcing sets and the relationship of zero forcing number to path cover number. We need some
additional deﬁnitions related to the zero forcing number.
Deﬁnition 2.1. A minimum zero forcing set is a zero forcing set Z such that |Z |

= Z(G).

Zero forcing chains of digraphs were deﬁned in [2]. We give an analogous deﬁnition for graphs.
Deﬁnition 2.2. Let Z be a zero forcing set of a graph G.

• Construct the derived set, recording the forces in the order in which they are performed. This is
the chronological list of forces.

• A forcing chain (for this particular chronological list of forces) is a sequence of vertices
(v1 , v2 , . . . , vk ) such that for i = 1, . . . , k − 1, vi → vi+1 .
• A maximal forcing chain is a forcing chain that is not a proper subsequence of another zero forcing
chain.
Note that a zero forcing chain can consist of a single vertex (v1 ), and such a chain is maximal if

v1

∈ Z and v1 does not perform a force.

As noted in [1], the derived set of a given set of black vertices is unique; however, a chronological
list of forces (of one particular zero forcing set) usually is not. At Rocky Mountain Discrete Mathematics
Days held September 12–13, 2008 at the University of Wyoming, the following questions were raised.
Question 2.3. Is there a graph that has a unique minimum zero forcing set?
Question 2.4. Is there a graph G and a vertex v

∈ VG such that v is in every minimum zero forcing set?

We show the answers to both these questions are negative for nontrivial connected graphs.
Deﬁnition 2.5. Let Z be a zero forcing set of a graph G. A reversal of Z is the set of last vertices of the
maximal zero forcing chains of a chronological list of forces.
Each vertex can force at most one other vertex and can be forced by at most one other vertex, so
the maximal forcing chains are disjoint, and the elements of Z are the initial vertices of the maximal
forcing chains. Thus the cardinality of a reversal of Z is the same as the cardinality of Z.
Theorem 2.6. If Z is a zero forcing set of G then so is any reversal of Z.
Proof. Write the chronological list of forces in reverse order, reversing each force (call this the
reverse chronological list of forces) and let the reversal of Z for this list be denoted W . We show
the reverse chronological list of forces is a valid list of forces for W . Consider the ﬁrst “force" u → v on
the reverse chronological list. All neighbors of u except v must be in W, since when the last force v → u

F. Barioli et al. / Linear Algebra and its Applications 433 (2010) 401–411

405

of Z was done, each of them had the white neighbor u and thus did not force any vertex previously (in
the original chronological list of forces). Thus u → v is a valid force for W . Continue in this manner or
use induction on |G|.
Corollary 2.7. No connected graph of order greater than one has a unique minimum zero forcing set.
Lemma 2.8. Let G be a connected graph of order greater than one and let Z be a minimum zero forcing set.
Every z ∈ Z has a neighbor w ∈
/ Z.
Proof. Suppose not. Then there is a vertex z ∈ Z such that every neighbor of z is in Z (and z does have
at least one neighbor v). Since z cannot perform a force, z is in the reversal W of Z. Using the reversed
maximal forcing chains, no neighbor of z performs a force. So W \{z } is a zero forcing set of smaller
cardinality, because after every vertex except z is black, v can force z.
Theorem 2.9. If G is a connected graph of order greater than one, then
Z ∈ZFS (G)

Z

= ∅,

where ZFS (G) is the set of all minimum zero forcing sets of G.
Proof. Suppose not. Then there exists v ∈ ∩Z ∈ZFS(G) Z. In particular, for each Z and each reversal W of
Z, v is in both Z and W . This means that there is a maximal forcing chain consisting of only v, or in
other words v does not force any other vertex.
Let Z be a zero forcing set. If there is no chronological list of forces in which a neighbor of v performs
a force, then replace Z by its reversal (since, by Lemma 2.8, v originally had a white neighbor u, in the
reversal u performs a force). Let u → w be the ﬁrst force in which the forcing vertex u is a neighbor of v.
We claim that Z \{v} ∪ {w}is a zero forcing set for G. The forces can proceed until u is encountered as a
forcing vertex. At that time, replace u → w by u → v, and then continue as in the original chronological
list of forces.
Next we show that for any graph the zero forcing number is an upper bound for the path cover
number.
Proposition 2.10. For any graph G, P(G)

Z(G).

Proof. Let Z be a zero forcing set. The vertices in a forcing chain induce a path in G because the forces
in a forcing chain occur chronologically in the order of the chain (since only a black vertex can force).
The maximal forcing chains are disjoint, contain all the vertices of G, and the elements of the set Z
are the initial vertices of the maximal forcing chains. Thus P(G) |Z |. By choosing a minimum zero
forcing set Z, P(G) Z(G).
In [14] it was shown that for a tree T , P(T ) = M(T ), and in [1] it was shown that for a tree, P(T ) =
Z(T ) (and thus M(T ) = Z(T )). In [3] it was shown that for graphs in general, P(G) and M(G) are not
comparable. However, Sinkovic has established the following relationship for outerplanar graphs: If
G is an outerplanar graph, then M(G) P(G) [16]. The next example shows that neither outerplanar
graphs nor 2-trees require M(G) = Z(G) or P(G) = Z(G) (a 2-tree is constructed inductively by starting
with a K3 and connecting each new vertex to 2 adjacent existing vertices).
Example 2.11. Let G12 be the graph shown in Fig. 2.1, called the pinwheel on 12 vertices. Note that
G12 is an outerplanar 2-tree. The set {1, 2, 6, 10} is a zero forcing set for G12 , so Z(G12 ) 4. We
show that Z(G12 ) 4, which implies Z(G12 ) = 4. Suppose to the contrary that Z is a zero forcing
set for G12 and |Z | = 3. To start the forcing, at least two of the vertices must be in one of the sets
{1, 2, 3}, {7, 8, 9}, {10, 11, 12}; without loss of generality, assume that two or three black vertices
are in {1, 2, 3}. Then after several forces the vertices {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} are black, and at most one additional vertex v ∈
/ {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} is in Z. To perform another force with only one more black vertex v,

either 6 or 7 must be black, and 5 can force the other, but then no additional forces can be performed,
so Z was not a zero forcing set for G12 . Clearly G12 can be covered by 9 triangles, so cc(G12 ) 9 and

+ (G12 ) = mr(G12 ) = cc(G12 ) = 9. Since G12 is chordal, mr+ (G12 ) =
C
cc(G12 ) [4], and thus M+ (G12 ) = 3.

3. The positive semideﬁnite zero forcing number
In this section, we introduce the positive deﬁnite zero forcing number, relate it to maximum positive
semideﬁnite nullity and to the OS number, and apply it to compute maximum positive semideﬁnite
nullity of several families of graphs. The deﬁnitions and terminology for zero forcing (coloring, derived
set, etc.) are the same as for the zero forcing number Z(G), but the color change rule is different.
Deﬁnition 3.1

• The positive semideﬁnite color change rule is:

•

Let B be the set consisting of all the black vertices. Let W1 , . . . , Wk be the sets of vertices of the k
components of G − B (note that it is possible that k = 1). Let w ∈ Wi . If u ∈ B and w is the only
white neighbor of u in G[Wi ∪ B], then change the color of w to black.
The positive semideﬁnite zero forcing number of a graph G, denoted by Z+ (G), is the minimum of
|X | over all positive semideﬁnite zero forcing sets X ⊆ VG (using the positive semideﬁnite color
change rule).

Forcing using the positive semideﬁnite color change rule can be thought of as decomposing the
graph into a union of certain induced subgraphs and using ordinary zero forcing on each of these
induced subgraphs. The application of the positive semideﬁnite color change rule is illustrated in the
next example.
Example 3.2. Let T be a tree. Then Z+ (T ) = 1, because any one vertex v is a positive semideﬁnite zero
forcing set. Formally, this can be established by induction on |T |: If v is a leaf, it forces its neighbor;
if not, a decomposition takes place. In either case smaller tree(s) are obtained. It has been known for
a long time (see, for example, [7]) that MC
+ (T ) = 1, but the use of Z+ provides an easy proof of this

result, because MC
+ (T )

= 1 is an immediate consequence of Z+ (T ) = 1 by Theorem 3.5 below.

Observation 3.3. Since any zero forcing set is a positive deﬁnite zero forcing set,
Z+ (G)

Z(G).

Example 3.4. The pinwheel G12 shown in Figure 2.1 has Z+ (G12 ) = 3 = MR
+ (G12 ) because X = {4, 5, 6}
is a positive semideﬁnite zero forcing set (G12 − X is disconnected, and X is a zero forcing set for
G[{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}], etc.).

Theorem 3.5. For any graph G, MC
+ (G)

=

Z+ (G).

Proof. Let A ∈ H+ (G) with null A = MC
+ (G). Let x = [xi ] be a nonzero vector in ker A. Deﬁne B to be
the set of indices u such that xu = 0 and let W1 , . . . , Wk be the sets of vertices of the k components of
G − B. We claim that in G[B ∪ Wi ], w ∈ Wi cannot be the unique neighbor of any vertex u ∈ B. Once
the claim is established, if X is a positive semideﬁnite zero forcing set for G, then the only vector in
ker A with zeros in positions indexed by X is the zero vector, and thus MC
Z+ (G).
+ (G)
To establish the claim, renumber the vertices so that the vertices of B are last, the vertices of W1
are ﬁrst, followed by the vertices of W2 , etc. Then A has the block form

Partition x conformally as x = [x1T , . . . , xkT , 0]T , and note that all entries of xi are nonzero, i =
1, . . . , k. Then Ax = 0 implies Ai xi = 0, i = 1, . . . , k. Since A is positive semideﬁnite, each column in Ci∗
is in the span of the columns of Ai by the column inclusion property of Hermitian positive semideﬁnite
matrices [8]. That is, for i = 1, . . . , k, there exists Yi such that Ci∗ = Ai Yi . Thus Ci xi = Yi∗ Ai xi = 0, and
w ∈ Wi cannot be the unique neighbor in Wi of any vertex u ∈ B.
Theorem 3.5 is also a consequence of Theorem 3.6 below and Theorem 1.3 above, but using that as
a justiﬁcation obscures the motivation for the deﬁnition and the connection between zero forcing and
null vectors that is given in the short direct proof.
In [15, Theorem 2.10] it is shown that |G| − Z(G) OS (G). A similar method can be used to show
a more precise relationship between Z+ and the OS number.
Theorem 3.6. For any graph G = (V , E ) and any ordered set S, V \S is a positive semideﬁnite forcing set
for G, and for any positive semideﬁnite forcing set X for G, there is an order that makes V \X an ordered set
for G. Thus Z+ (G) + OS (G) = |G|.
Proof. Let X be a positive semideﬁnite zero forcing set for G such that |X | = Z+ (G). Let vi be the
vertex colored black by the ith application of the positive semideﬁnite color change rule. We show
that S = (vt , vt −1 , . . . , v1 ) is an OS set for G, where t = |G| − Z+ (G). Further deﬁne X0 = X, and
Xi+1 = Xi ∪ {vi+1 }, for i = 0, 1, . . . , t − 1. For each vi , since it was initially white and then colored
black on the ith application of the positive semideﬁnite color change rule, there exists a vertex wi ∈ Xi
(the current black vertices) such that vi is the only neighbor in the subgraph of G induced by Xi ∪ H1 ,
where the subgraph G\Xi has components H1 , H2 , . . . Hp with vi ∈ H1 . Since X is a positive semideﬁnite
zero forcing set, no other vertex from the set {vi+1 , vi+2 , . . . , vt } (the remaining white vertices) can be
in H1 and be a neighbor of wi . Hence the set (vt , vt −1 , . . . , v1 ) is an OS-set. Therefore t OS (G). Thus

|G| − Z+ (G)

OS(G).

(3.1)

For the converse, we use the fact that if S = (v1 , v2 , . . . , vm ) is an OS set, then the set S \{vm } is also
an OS set. Suppose S = (v1 , v2 , . . . , vm ) is an OS set with |S | = OS (G). Then we claim that V \S is a
positive semideﬁnite zero forcing set. So color the vertices in V \S black, and suppose the subgraph Gm
induced by the vertices of {v1 , . . . , vm } has components induced by U1 , U2 , . . . , U . Let vm ∈ U1 . Since
S is an OS-set there exists a vertex wm ∈ V \S such that {wm , vm } ∈ E and {wm , vs } ∈
/ E for all other
vs ∈ U1 . This implies that vm can be colored black under the positive semideﬁnite color change rule.

408

F. Barioli et al. / Linear Algebra and its Applications 433 (2010) 401–411

Since S \{vm } is also an OS-set for G, we may continue this argument and deduce that V \S is a positive
semideﬁnite zero forcing set. Hence

|G| − OS(G) = |V \S|

Z+ (G),

(3.2)

as the positive semideﬁnite zero forcing number is deﬁned as a minimum over all such zero forcing
sets. From (3.1) and (3.2), Z+ (G) + OS(G) = |G|.
Corollary 3.7. For every graph G,

δ(G)

Z+ (G).

Proof. By [15, Corollary 2.19], OS(G)
result.

|G| − δ(G). Combining this with Theorem 3.6 gives the

Another consequence of Theorem 3.6 is that there are examples of graphs for which Z+ may not
be equal to MC
+ . For example, in [15] it was shown that the Möbius Ladder on 8 vertices, sometimes

= 4 and mrC
+ (ML8 ) = 5. In this case, by Theorem 3.6, it follows
that Z+ (ML8 ) = 4, and hence Z+ (ML8 ) > 3 = MC
+ (ML8 ).

In [1], the zero forcing number was used to establish the minimum rank/maximum nullity of
numerous families of graphs. The positive semideﬁnite zero forcing number is equally effective. Here
we apply it to two families of graphs. The set of vertices associated with (the same) positive semideﬁnite
zero forcing set in each copy of G is a positive semideﬁnite zero forcing set for G H.

Proof. Let T be a tree of order n 2. By Corollary 3.9, Z+ (T Kr ) r. We show r MR
+ (T Kr ) by
constructing a matrix A ∈ S+ (T Kr ) of rank at most (n − 1)r, and the result then follows from
Theorem 3.5. The construction is by induction on n. Let P2 denote the path on 2 vertices. To show
−1 ∈ S (K ) (for examthat mrR

S+ (P2 Kr ) and rank B = rank M = r. Without loss of generality, in T vertex n is adjacent only
to vertex n − 1. We order the vertices (i, j) of T Kr lexicographically. By the induction hypothesis, there is a matrix C ∈ S+ ((T − n) Kr ) such that rank C = (n − 2)r; let C = C ⊕ 0r ×r . Using
B ∈ S+ (P2 Kr ) already constructed with rank r, let B = 0(n−2)r ×(n−2)r ⊕ B. Then for α ∈ R chosen
to avoid cancellation, A = C + α B ∈ S+ (T Kr ) and rank A (n − 2)r + r = (n − 1)r.
A book with m 2 pages, denoted Bm [9, p. 14], is m copies of a 4-cycle with one edge in common,
or equivalently, Bm = K1,m P2 , where K1,m is the complete bipartite graph with partite sets of 1 and
m vertices. For m 2, t 3, we call m copies of a t-cycle with one edge in common a generalized book,

Clearly mrC

mrR
+ (G) for every graph G. Previously it was not known whether mr+ (G) could

differ from mr+ (G) [7, p. 578]. In this ﬁnal section we provide an example of a graph for which these
parameters are not identical.
Example 4.1. The “k-wheel with 4 hubs" (for k at least 3) is the graph on 4k + 4 vertices such that
the outer cycle has 4k vertices, and each of the four hubs is attached to every 4th vertex of the cycle,
and no others; this graph is denoted H4 (k), and H4 (3) is shown in Fig. 4.1. This family arose in Hall’s
R
investigation of graphs having minimum rank 3 [11]. We show mrC
+ (H4 (3)) = 3 and mr+ (H4 (3)) = 4.
As numbered in Fig. 4.1, H4 (3) is bipartite with partite sets consisting of the odd vertices and the
R
even vertices. By [2, Theorem 3.1], mrR
+ (H4 (3)) = mr (YH4 (3) ) where YH4 (3) is the biadjacency zero–
nonzero pattern of H4 (3) and mrR (YH4 (3) ) is the asymmetric minimum rank over the real numbers

(Theorem 3.1 applies to H4 (3) because H4 (3) is a bipartite graph). The same method used to prove
C
C
Theorem 3.1 also shows that mrC
+ (H4 (3)) = mr (YH4 (3) ) where mr (YH4 (3) ) is the asymmetric minimum rank over the complex numbers (in [2, Remark 3.2] it is noted that the method in Theorem
3.1 is valid for constructing a symmetric matrix over an inﬁnite ﬁeld, and the same reasoning applies
to constructing a Hermitian matrix over C by using Hermitian adjoints in place of transposes). After scaling rows and columns, a minimum rank matrix having zero-nonzero pattern YH4 (3) has the
form

in the ﬁrst three rows and columns is nonsingular, rank A = 3 implies that rows 4 through 8 are linear
combinations of rows 1 through 3. Computations show that the following assignments of variables are

mrC
