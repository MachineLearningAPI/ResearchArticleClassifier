This paper is the ﬁrst one in a series focusing on the
method of interlacing polynomials. In the next paper [2], we
use the method of interlacing polynomials to give a positive
resolution to the Kadison–Singer problem.

Abstract—We prove that there exist inﬁnite families of
regular bipartite Ramanujan graphs of every degree bigger
than 2. We do this by proving a variant of a conjecture of Bilu
and Linial about the existence of good 2-lifts of every graph.
We also establish the existence of inﬁnite families of ‘irregular Ramanujan’ graphs, whose eigenvalues are bounded
by the spectral radius of their universal cover. Such families
were conjectured to exist by Linial and others. In particular,
we prove the existence of inﬁnite families of (c, d)-biregular
bipartite
graphs
with all non-trivial eigenvalues bounded by
√
√
c − 1 + d − 1, for all c, d ≥ 3.
Our proof exploits a new technique for demonstrating the
existence of useful combinatorial objects that we call the
“method of interlacing polynomials”.

A. Ramanujan Graphs
Ramanujan graphs are deﬁned in terms of the eigenvalues
of their adjacency matrices. If G is a d-regular graph and A
is its adjacency matrix, then d is always an eigenvalue of A.
The matrix A has an eigenvalue of −d if and only if G is
bipartite. The eigenvalues of d, and −d when G is bipartite,
are called the trivial eigenvalues of A. Following Lubotzky,
Phillips and Sarnak [3], we say that a d-regular graph is
Ramanujan
if all√of its non-trivial eigenvalues lie between
√
−2 d − 1 and 2 d − 1. It is easy to construct Ramanujan
graphs with a small number of vertices: d-regular complete
graphs and complete bipartite graphs are Ramanujan. The
challenge is to construct an inﬁnite family of d-regular
graphs that are all Ramanujan. One cannot construct inﬁnite
families of d-regular graphs whose eigenvalues lie in a
smaller range: the Alon–Boppana bound (see [4]) tells us
that for every constant > 0, every sufﬁciently large dregular graph has
√ a non-trivial eigenvalue with absolute
value at least 2 d − 1 − .
Lubotzky, Phillips and Sarnak [3] and Margulis [5] were
the ﬁrst to construct Ramanujan graphs. They built both
bipartite and non-bipartite Ramanujan graphs from Cayley
graphs. All of their graphs are regular and have degrees
p + 1 where p is a prime. There have been very few other
constructions of Ramanujan graphs [6], [7], [8], [9]. To the
best of our knowledge, the only degrees for which inﬁnite
families of Ramanujan graphs were previously known to
exist were those of the form q + 1 where q is a prime
power. Lubotzky [10, Problem 10.7.3] asked whether there
exist inﬁnite families of Ramanujan graphs of every degree
greater than 2. We resolve this conjecture in the afﬁrmative
in the bipartite case.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Ramanujan graphs have been the focus of substantial
study in Theoretical Computer Science and Mathematics.
They are graphs whose non-trivial adjacency matrix eigenvalues are as small as possible. Previous constructions
of Ramanujan graphs have been sporadic, only producing
Ramanujan graphs of particular degrees. In this paper, we
prove a variant of a conjecture of Bilu and Linial [1], and
use it to realize an approach they suggested for constructing
bipartite Ramanujan graphs of every degree.
Our main technical contribution is a novel existence
argument. The conjecture of Bilu and Linial requires us to
prove that every graph has a signed adjacency matrix with all
of its eigenvalues in a small range. We do this by proving
that the roots of the expected characteristic polynomial of
a randomly signed adjacency matrix lie in this range. In
general, a statement like this is useless, as the roots of a
sum of polynomials do not necessarily have anything to
do with the roots of the polynomials in the sum. However,
there seem to be many sums of combinatorial polynomials
for which this intuition is wrong. With this in mind, we
deﬁne an “interlacing family” of polynomials and then use a
technique we call the “method of interlacing polynomials” to
show that such families always contain a polynomial whose
largest root is at most the largest root of the sum. To ﬁnish
the proof, we then bound the largest root of the sum of the
characteristic polynomials of the signed adjacency matrices
of a graph by observing that this sum is the well-studied
matching polynomial of the graph.

B. 2-Lifts
Bilu and Linial [1] suggested constructing Ramanujan
graphs through a sequence of 2-lifts of a base graph. Given
a graph G = (V, E), a 2-lift of G is a graph that has two
vertices for each vertex in V . This pair of vertices is called
529

the ﬁbre of the original vertex. Every edge in E corresponds
to two edges in the 2-lift. If (u, v) is an edge in E, {u0 , u1 }
is the ﬁbre of u, and {v0 , v1 } is the ﬁbre of v, then the 2-lift
can either contain the pair of edges
{(u0 , v0 ), (u1 , v1 )} , or
{(u0 , v1 ), (u1 , v0 )} .

(see also [14]) prove a generalization of the Alon–Boppana
bound that applies to (c, d)-biregular graphs: for all > 0,
all sufﬁciently large (c, d)-biregular graphs
√ have a√non-trivial
eigenvalue with absolute value at least c − 1+ d − 1− .
Thus, we say that a (c, d)-biregular graph is
√ if all
√Ramanujan
of its non-trivial eigenvalues are at most c − 1 + d − 1.
We prove the existence of inﬁnite families of (c, d)-biregular
Ramanujan graphs for all c, d ≥ 3.
The regular and biregular Ramanujan graphs discussed
above are actually special cases of a more general phenomenon. To describe it, we will require a construction
known as the universal cover. The universal cover of a
graph G is the inﬁnite tree T such that every connected
lift of G is a quotient of the tree (see, e.g., [15, Section
6]). It can be deﬁned concretely by ﬁrst ﬁxing a “root”
vertex v0 , and then placing one vertex in T for every nonbacktracking walk (v0 , v1 , . . . , v ) starting at v0 , where a
walk is non-backtracking if vi−1 = vi+1 for all i. Two
vertices of T are adjacent if and only if one is a simple
extension of another, i.e., the edges of T are all of the form
(v0 , v1 , . . . , v ) ∼ (v0 , v1 , . . . , v , v +1 ). The universal cover
of a graph is unique up to isomorphism, independent of the
choice of v0
The adjacency matrix AT of the universal cover T is an
inﬁnite-dimensional symmetric matrix. We will be interested
in the spectral radius ρ(T ) of T , which may be deﬁned1 as:

(1)
(2)

If only edge pairs of the ﬁrst type appear, then the 2-lift is
just two disjoint copies of the original graph. If only edge
pairs of the second type appear, then we obtain the doublecover of G. To determine the eigenvalues of a 2-lift, Bilu and
Linial introduce signings of the edges of G: s : E → {±1}.
They place signings in one-to-one correspondence with 2lifts by setting s(u, v) = 1 if edges of type (1) appear in the
2-lift, and s(u, v) = −1 if edges of type (2) appear.
To analyze the eigenvalues of a 2-lift, they deﬁne the
signed adjacency matrix As to be the same as the adjacency
matrix of G, except that the entries corresponding to an
edge (u, v) are s(u, v). They prove [1, Lemma 3.1] that
the eigenvalues of the 2-lift are the union, taken with
multiplicity, of the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix of
A and of the signed adjacency matrix of A. Following
Friedman [11], they refer to the eigenvalues of A as the
old eigenvalues and the eigenvalues of the signed adjacency
matrix as the new eigenvalues. They prove that every graph
of maximal degree d has a signing in which all of the new
eigenvalues have absolute value at most O( d log3 d). They
then build d-regular expander graphs by repeatedly taking 2lifts of a complete graph on d + 1 vertices.
Bilu and Linial conjectured that every d-regular graph has
a signing in which
√ all of the new eigenvalues have absolute
value at most 2 d − 1. If one applied the corresponding 2lifts to the d-regular complete graph, one would obtain an
inﬁnite sequence of d-regular Ramanujan graphs. We prove a
weak version of Bilu and Linial’s conjecture: every d-regular
graph has√a signing in which all of the new eigenvalues are
at most 2 d − 1. The difference between our result and the
original conjecture is that we do not control the smallest
new eigenvalue. This is why we consider bipartite graphs.
The eigenvalues of the adjacency matrices of bipartite graphs
are symmetric about zero (see, for example, [12, Theorem
2.4.2]) So, a bound on the smallest non-trivial eigenvalue
follows from a bound on the largest. We also use the fact
that a 2-lift of a bipartite graph is also bipartite. By applying
the corresponding 2-lifts to the d-regular complete bipartite
graph, we obtain an inﬁnite sequence of d-regular bipartite
Ramanujan graphs.

where x 22 := i=1 x(i)2 whenever the series converges.
Naturally, the spectral radius of a ﬁnite tree is deﬁned to be
the norm of its adjacency matrix.
With these notions in hand, we can state the deﬁnition
of an irregular Ramanujan graph. As before, the largest
(and smallest, in the bipartite case) eigenvalues of ﬁnite
adjacency matrices are considered trivial. Greenberg [17]
(see also [18]) showed that for every
> 0 and every
inﬁnite family of graphs that have the same universal cover
T , all sufﬁciently large graphs in the family have a nontrivial eigenvalue with absolute value at least ρ(T ) − .
Following Hoory, Linial, and Wigderson [15, Deﬁnition 6.7],
we therefore deﬁne an arbitrary graph to be Ramanujan if all
of its non-trivial eigenvalues are smaller in absolute value
than the spectral radius of its universal cover.
The universal cover of any d-regular graph is the inﬁnite d-ary tree, whereas the universal cover of any (c, d)biregular graph is the inﬁnite (c, d)−biregular tree in which
the degrees alternate between c and d on every other
level [14]. The former tree is known to have spectral

C. Irregular Ramanujan Graphs and Universal Covers
We say that a bipartite graph is (c, d)-biregular if all
vertices on one side of the bipartition have degree c and
all vertices on the other side have degree d. The adjacency
matrix
√ of a (c, d)-biregular graph always has eigenvalues
± cd; these are its trivial eigenvalues. Feng and Li [13]

1 In functional analysis, the spectral radius of an inﬁnite-dimensional
operator A is traditionally deﬁned to be the largest λ for which (A − λI)
is unbounded. However, in the case of self-adjoint operators, this deﬁnition
is equivalent to the one presented here (see, for example, Theorem VI.6 in
[16]).

d − 1 while the latter has a spectral radius of
√
c − 1 + d − 1 (see [19], [14]). Thus, a deﬁnition based
on universal covers generalizes both the regular and biregular deﬁnitions of Ramanujan graphs, and the bound of
Greenberg generalizes both the Alon-Boppana and Feng-Li
bounds.
In this general setting, we show that every bipartite graph
G has a 2-lift in which all of the new eigenvalues are less
than the spectral radius of its universal cover. Applying these
2-lifts inductively to any ﬁnite irregular bipartite Ramanujan
graph yields an inﬁnite family of irregular bipartite Ramanujan graphs whose degree distribution matches that of the
initial graph (since taking a 2-lift simply doubles the number
of vertices of each degree). In particular, applying them to
the (c, d)-biregular complete bipartite graph yields an inﬁnite
family of (c, d)-biregular Ramanujan graphs. As far as we
know, inﬁnite families of irregular Ramanujan graphs were
not known to exist prior to this work.

that we will exploit in this paper. It is worth mentioning
that the proofs of these theorems are elementary and short,
relying only on simple recurrence formulas for the matching
polynomial.
Theorem III.1 (Theorem 4.2 in [32]). For every graph G,
μG (x) has only real roots.
Theorem III.2 (Theorem 4.3 in [32]). For every graph G of
maximum degree√d, all of the roots of μG (x) have absolute
value at most 2 d − 1.
The preceding theorems will allow us to prove the existence of inﬁnite families of d-regular bipartite Ramanujan
graphs. To handle the irregular case, we will require a
reﬁnement of these results due to Godsil. This reﬁnement
uses the concept of a path tree, which was also introduced
by Godsil (see [33] or [12, Section 6]). Recall that a path
in G is a walk that does not visit any vertex twice.
Deﬁnition III.3. Given a graph G and a vertex u, the
path tree P (G, u) contains one vertex for every path in
G (with distinct vertices) that starts at u. Two paths are
adjacent if one is a simple extension of the other, i.e., all
the edges of P (G, u) are all of the form (u, v1 , . . . , v ) ∼
(u, v1 , . . . , v , v +1 ).

D. Related Work
There have been numerous studies of random lifts of
graphs. For some results on the spectra of random lifts,
we point the reader to [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25].
Friedman [26] has proved that almost every d-regular graph
almost meets the Ramanujan bound: he shows that for every
> 0 the absolute value of all the non-trivial eigenvalues of
almost
every sufﬁciently large d-regular graph are at most
√
2 d − 1 + . In the irregular case, Puder [27] has shown
that with high probability a high-order lift of a graph G√has
new eigenvalues that are bounded in absolute value by 3ρ,
where ρ is the spectral radius of the universal cover of G.
We remark that constructing bipartite Ramanujan graphs
is at least as easy as constructing non-bipartite ones: the
double-cover of a d-regular non-bipartite Ramanujan graph
is a d-regular bipartite Ramanujan graph. For many applications of expander graphs, we refer the reader to [15].
For those applications of expanders that just require upper
bounds on the second eigenvalue, one can use bipartite Ramanujan graphs. Some applications actually require bipartite
expanders, while others require the non-bipartite ones. For
example, the explicit constructions of error correcting codes
of Sipser and Spielman [28] require non-bipartite expanders,
while the improvements of their construction [29], [30], [31]
require bipartite Ramanujan expanders.

The path tree provides a natural relationship between the
roots of the matching polynomial of a graph and the spectral
radius of its universal cover:
Theorem III.4 ([33]). Let P (G, u) be a path tree of G. Then
the matching polynomial of G divides the characteristic
polynomial of the adjacency matrix of P (G, u). In particular, all of the roots of μG (x) are real and have absolute
value at most ρ(P (G, u)).
Lemma III.5. Let G be a graph and let T be its universal
cover. Then the roots of μG (x) are bounded in absolute value
by ρ(T ).
Proof: Let u be any vertex of G and let P be the
path tree rooted at u. Since the paths that correspond to
the vertices of P are themselves non-backtracking walks (as
deﬁned in Section II-C), P is a ﬁnite induced subgraph of
the universal cover T , and AP is a ﬁnite submatrix of AT .
By Theorem III.4, the roots of μG are bounded by

two remarkable theorems about the matching polynomial

531

Proof: Let the polynomials be of degree n. Let g be a
polynomial that interlaces all of the fi , and let αn−1 be
the largest root of g. As each fi has a positive leading
coefﬁcient, it is positive for sufﬁciently large x. As each
fi has exactly one root that is at least αn−1 , each fi is nonpositive at αn−1 . So, f∅ is also non-positive at αn−1 , and
eventually becomes positive. This tells us that f∅ has a root
that is at least αn−1 , and so its largest root is at least αn−1 .
Let βn be this root.
As f∅ is the sum of the fi , there must be some i for which
fi (βn ) ≥ 0. As fi has at most one root that is at least αn−1 ,
and fi (αn−1 ) ≤ 0, the largest root of fi is it at least αn−1
and at most βn .
One can show that the assumptions of the lemma imply
that f∅ is itself a real-rooted polynomial. However, we will
not require this fact.
If the polynomials do not have a common interlacing, the
sum may not be real rooted: consider (x + 1)(x + 2) + (x −
1)(x−2). Even if the sum of two polynomials is real rooted,
the conclusion of Lemma IV.2 may fail to hold if the interval
containing the largest roots of each polynomial overlaps the
interval containing their second-largest roots. For example,
consider the sum of the polynomials (x + 5)(x − 9)(x − 10)
and (x + 6)(x − 1)(x − 8). It has roots at approximately
−5.3, 6.4, and 7.4, whence its largest root is smaller than
the largest root of both polynomials of which it is the sum.

spectral radius of a path tree of a (c, d)-regular bipartite
graph without considering inﬁnite trees. We point the reader
to Section 5.6 of Godsil’s book [12] for an elementary
argument.
We now recall a theorem of Godsil and Gutman which
says that the matching polynomial of a graph equals the
expected characteristic polynomial of random signing of
the adjacency matrix of that graph. To associate a signing
m
of the edges of G with a vector in {±1} , we choose
an arbitrary ordering of the m edges of G, denote the
edges by e1 , . . . , em , and a signing of these edges by
m
s ∈ {±1} . We then let As denote the signed adjacency
matrix corresponding to s, and deﬁne fs (x) = det[xI − As ]
to be characteristic polynomial of As .
Theorem III.6 (Corollary 2.2 of Godsil and Gutman [34]).
Es∈{±1}m [fs (x)] = μG (x).
For the convenience of the reader, we present a simple
proof of this theorem in the Appendix.
To prove that a good lift exists, it sufﬁces, by Theorems
III.2 and III.6, to show that there is a signing s so that
the largest root of fs (x) is at most the largest root of
Es∈{±1}m [fs (x)]. To do this, we prove that the polynomials
{fs (x)}s∈{±1}m are what we call an interlacing family. We
deﬁne interlacing families and examine their properties in
the next section.

We will prove that the polynomials {fs }s∈{±1}m deﬁned

the following result, which seems to have been discovered a
number of times. It appears as Theorem 2.1 of Dedieu [35]
and (essentially) as Theorem 2 of Fell [36]. In the case
that the roots of f and g are distinct, it appears as Proposition 1.35 in Fisk [37].

Theorem V.4. For every d ≥ 3 there is an inﬁnite sequence
of d-regular bipartite Ramanujan graphs.
Proof: The complete bipartite graph of degree d is
Ramanujan. By Lemma 3.1 of [1] and Theorem V.3, for
every d-regular bipartite Ramanujan graph G, there
√ is a 2-lift
in which every non-trivial eigenvalue is at most 2 d − 1. As
the 2-lift of a bipartite graph is bipartite, and the eigenvalues
of a bipartite graph are symmetric about 0, this 2-lift is also
a regular bipartite Ramanujan graph.
Thus, for every d-regular bipartite Ramanujan graph G,
there is another d-regular bipartite Ramanujan graph with
twice as many vertices.

Lemma IV.5. Let f and g be (univariate) polynomials of
the same degree such that, for all λ ∈ [0, 1], λf + (1 − λ)g

V. T HE MAIN RESULT

Theorem V.5. For every c, d ≥ 3, there is an inﬁnite
sequence of (c, d)-biregular bipartite Ramanujan graphs.

Our proof that the polynomials {fs }s∈{±1}m are an interlacing family relies on the following generalization of the
fact that the matching polynomial is real-rooted. It amounts
to saying that if we pick each sign independently with
any probabilities, then the resulting polynomial is still realrooted.

Proof: Let Kc,d be the complete bipartite graph with c
vertices on one side and d on the other. The adjacency matrix
of this graph has rank 2, so its non-trivial eigenvalues are
zero and it is Ramanujan.
We will construct an inﬁnite sequence of (c, d)-biregular
bipartite graphs. Let G be any (c, d)-biregular bipartite Ramanujan graph. As mentioned in Section II-C, the universal
cover of G is √
the inﬁnite√(c, d)-biregular tree, which has
spectral radius c − 1 + d − 1. Thus, Theorem V.3 tells
us that there
is a √
2-lift of G with all new eigenvalues
√
at most c − 1 + d − 1. As this graph is bipartite, all
of
eigenvalues have absolute value at most
√
√ its non-trivial
c − 1 + d − 1. So, the resulting 2-lift is a larger (c, d)biregular bipartite Ramanujan graph.
To conclude the section, we remark that repeated application of Theorem V.3 can be used to generate an inﬁnite
sequence of irregular Ramanujan graphs from any ﬁnite
irregular bipartite Ramanujan graph, since all of the lifts
produced will have (by deﬁnition, since they are connected)
the same universal cover. In contrast, Lubotzky and Nagnibeda [38] have shown that there exist inﬁnite trees that
cover inﬁnitely many ﬁnite graphs but such that none of the
ﬁnite graphs are Ramanujan.

Theorem V.1. Let p1 , . . . , pm be numbers in [0, 1]. Then,
the following polynomial is real-rooted
(1 − pi ) fs (x).

We will prove this theorem using machinery that we
develop in Section VI.
Theorem V.2. The polynomials {fs }s∈{±1}m are an interlacing family.
Proof: We will show that for every 0 ≤ k ≤ m − 1,
every partial assignment s1 ∈ ±1, . . . , sk ∈ ±1, and every
λ ∈ [0, 1], the polynomial
λfs1 ,...,sk ,1 (x) + (1 − λ)fs1 ,...,sk ,−1 (x)
is real-rooted. The theorem will then follow from
Lemma IV.5.
To show that the above polynomial is real-rooted, we
apply Theorem V.1 with pk+1 = λ, pk+2 , . . . , pm = 1/2,
and pi = (1 + si )/2 for 1 ≤ i ≤ k.

VI. R EAL STABLE POLYNOMIALS
In this section we will establish the real-rootedness of
a class of polynomials which includes the polynomials of
Theorem V.1. We will do this by considering a multivariate
generalization of real-rootedness called real stability (see,
e.g., the surveys [39], [40]). In particular, we will show
that the univariate polynomials we are interested in are the
images, under a well-behaved linear transformation, of a
multivariate real stable polynomial.

Theorem V.3. Let G be a graph with adjacency matrix
A and universal cover T . Then there is a signing s of A
so that all of the eigenvalues of As are at most ρ(T ). In
particular,√for d-regular graphs, the eigenvalues of As are
at most 2 d − 1.
Proof: The ﬁrst statement follows immediately from
Theorems IV.4 and V.2 and Lemma III.5. The second
statement follows by noting that the universal cover of a dregular graph is a d-regular tree, which has spectral radius

and a number p ∈ [0, 1],
Zu Zv (1 + p∂u + (1 − p)∂v ) det A + uaaT + vbbT
= p det A + aaT + (1 − p) det A + bbT .

Lemma VI.2. Let A1 , . . . , Am be positive semideﬁnite
matrices. Then

Proof: The matrix determinant lemma (see, e.g., [43])
states that for every nonsingular matrix A and every real
number t,

det [z1 A1 + · · · + zm Am ]

det A + taaT = det [A] (1 + taT A−1 a).

is real stable.
Real stable polynomials enjoy a number of useful
closure properties. In particular, it is easy to see that
if f (x1 , . . . , xk ) and g(y1 , . . . yj ) are real stable then
f (x1 , . . . , xk )g(y1 , . . . , yj ) is real stable. One can also
check that the real stability of f (x1 , . . . , xk ) implies the
real stability of f (x1 , . . . , xk−1 , c) for every c ∈ R (see,
e.g., Lemma 2.4 in [40]). For a variable xi , we let Zxi be
the operator on polynomials induced by setting this variable
to zero.
In [42], Borcea and Br¨and´en characterize an entire class of
differential operators that preserve real stability. To simplify
notation, we will let ∂zi denote the operation of partial
differentiation with respect to zi . For α, β ∈ Nn , we use
the notation

zα =

and ∂ β =

i=1

One consequence of this is Jacobi’s formula for the derivative of the determinant:
∂t det A + taaT = det [A] (aT A−1 a).
This formula implies that
Zu Zv (1 + p∂u + (1 − p)∂v ) det A + uaaT + vbbT
= det [A] 1 + p(aT A−1 a) + (1 − p)(bT A−1 b) .
By the matrix determinant lemma, this equals
p det A + aaT + (1 − p) det A + bbT .
Using these tools, we prove our main technical result on
real-rootedness.

The base case (k = 0) is trivially true, as it is the deﬁnition
of Q. The inductive step follows from Lemma VI.5. The
case k = m is exactly the claimed identity.
Starting with Q (a real stable polynomial) we can then
apply Corollary VI.4 and the closure of real stable polynomials under the restrictions of variables to real constants to
see that each of the polynomials above, including P (x), is
also real stable. As P (x) is real stable and has one variable,
it is real-rooted.
Alternatively, one can prove Theorem VI.6 by observing
that P is a mixed characteristic polynomial and then applying results of our second paper in this series [2].
Proof of Theorem V.1: Let d be the maximum degree
of G. We need to prove that the polynomial
(1 − pi ) det [xI − As ]

pi

pi
s∈{±1}m

i:si =1

i:si =−1

i:si =−1

as their roots only differ by d.
We now observe that the matrix dI − As is a signed
Laplacian matrix of G plus a nonnegative diagonal matrix.

The fact that this polynomial is real-rooted now follows from
Theorem VI.6, by creating auxiliary pi ’s that are all equal
to one to correspond to any ﬁxed du eu eTu terms.
VII. C ONCLUSION
We conclude by drawing an analogy between our proof
technique and the probabilistic method, which relies on the
fact that for every random variable X : Ω → R, there
is an ω ∈ Ω for which X(ω) ≤ E [X]. We have shown
that for certain special polynomial-valued random variables
P : Ω → R[x], there must be an ω with λmax (P (ω)) ≤
λmax (E [P ]). In fact it is possible to deﬁne interlacing
families in greater generality than we have done here, using
probabilistic notation. In particular, we call a polynomialvalued random variable P useful if P is deterministic
or there exist disjoint non-trivial events E1 , . . . , Ek with
i≤k Pr [Ei ] = 1 such that the polynomials {E [P |Ei ]}i≤k
have a common interlacing and each polynomial E [P |Ei ]
is itself useful. The conclusion of Theorem IV.4 continues
to hold for this deﬁnition, and we suspect it will be useful
in non-product settings. In the case of this paper, the events
Ei are particularly simple: they correspond to setting one
sign of a lift to be +1 or −1, and the resulting sequence
of polynomials f∅ , fs1 , . . . , fs1 ,...,sm forms a martingale (a
fact that we do not use, but may be interesting in its own
right).
Like many applications of the probabilistic method, our
proof does not yield a polynomial-time algorithm. In the
particular case of random lifts, the polynomial f∅ is itself a
matching polynomial, which is #P -hard to compute in general. It would certainly be interesting to ﬁnd computationally
efﬁcient analogues of our method.
