1. Introduction
In recent years, there has been independent study of fractional order operators by two different group of mathematicians. On one hand, there are extensive works that study properties of
fractional Laplacian operators as non-local operators together with applications to free-boundary
value problems and non-local minimal surfaces—by Caffarelli and Silvestre [6], and many others (see the related articles [5,7,4,9]); on the other hand, there is the work of Graham and
Zworski [17] (see also [20,12,26], for instance), that study a general class of conformally covariant operators (Pγ ), parameterized by a real number γ and defined on the boundary of a

conformally compact Einstein manifold, and which includes the fractional Laplacian operators as a special case when the boundary is the Euclidean space setting as boundary of the
hyperbolic space. In this note, we will clarify the connection between the work of these two
groups.
This paper is organized as follows: in Section 2 of the paper we will briefly describe the work
of Graham and Zworski [17] and the notion of the fractional Paneitz operator Pγ .
In Section 3, we will illustrate in Theorem 3.1 that in the case when the fractional Laplacian
operator (− )γ is defined on the Euclidean space Rn and γ ∈ (0, 1), the operator agrees with
Pγ on the hyperbolic space. This is done by applying the extension theorem of Caffarelli and
Silvestre [6] on a characterization of the fractional Laplacian operator (− )γ . We then extend the
work of Caffarelli and Silvestre [6] and the identification to Pγ as (− )γ on Rn for more general
exponents γ ∈ (0, n2 ). To achieve this, we first show in Theorem 3.2 that there are two different
ways to define Pγ operator when γ > 1, one can define it through the scattering matrix as in
the original work of Graham and Zworski, or one can define it through an iterated process based
on the work of Caffarelli and Silvestre; and two definitions agree (the relationship is illustrated
in the claim (3.16) in the proof of Theorem 3.2 and Eqs. (3.22) and (3.23)). Finally, we apply
Theorem 3.2 to generalize the extension theorem of Caffarelli and Silvestre from γ ∈ (0, 1) to
γ ∈ (0, n2 ) (this is Theorem 3.3).
In Section 4 of the paper, we will discuss the extension theorem in the general setting of
conformally compact Einstein manifolds. One point we make is that by choosing a suitable
defining function (in Lemma 4.5) which is related to the eigenfunctions of Laplacian of the
Einstein metric, Eq. (4.15) of the extension theorem on a general conformally compact Einstein
manifold (Theorem 4.7) is the same as the extension theorem on hyperbolic space studied in
Section 3; it is a pure divergence equation, degenerate elliptic, with a weight in the Muckenhoupt
class A2 .
Finally, in Section 5, we will discuss the extension theorem on a general asymptotically hyperbolic manifold; where the boundary manifold may not be the totally geodesic boundary of an
asymptotically hyperbolic space. In particular, it provides a natural way to define the conformal
fractional Laplacian on the boundary of any compact manifold, and a related fractional order
curvature Qγ . In this case, it is interesting to see that the statement of extension theorem (Theorem 5.1) breaks down at γ = 12 and at γ > 12 . In particular, there is an extra term in the expression
of P 1 which is the mean curvature of the boundary manifold. This dichotomy has already ap2
peared in other settings (Caffarelli and Souganidis [7], for instance), and illustrates the fact that
when γ ∈ (0, 12 ), the operator presents a stronger non-local behavior than when γ ∈ ( 12 , 1).
The authors wish that the results in this paper will lead to extension of the works of Caffarelli
and others on fractional free boundary value problems and fractional mean curvature surfaces to
general manifold settings. In particular, we pose the question of finding the relationship between
the fractional order mean curvature very recently defined (see Caffarelli et al. [4], Caffarelli and
Valdinoci [8]), and our notion of Qγ curvature coming from the fractional Paneitz operator. This
seems to be a very interesting open question.
2. Background
First we review the connection between scattering theory on conformally compact Einstein
manifolds and conformally invariant objects on their boundaries at infinity. The main references
are Graham and Zworski [17] and Fefferman and Graham [11].

We say that g + is a conformally compact (c.c.) metric on X with conformal infinity (M, [g])

then we call (X n+1 , g + ) a conformally compact Einstein manifold.
Given a conformally compact, asymptotically hyperbolic manifold (X n+1 , g + ) and a representative gˆ in [g]
ˆ on the conformal infinity M, there is a uniquely defining function ρ such that,
on M × (0, δ) in X, g + has the normal form g + = ρ −2 (dρ 2 + gρ ) where gρ is a one-parameter
ˆ Moreover, gρ has an asymptotic expansion which

contains only even powers of ρ, at least up to degree n.
It is well known (cf. Mazzeo and Melrose [22], Graham and Zworski [17]) that, given f ∈
C∞ (M) and s ∈ C, the eigenvalue problem
−

g + u − s(n − s)u = 0,

in X

(2.1)

has a solution of the form
u = Fρ n−s + Hρ s ,

F, H ∈ C ∞ (X),

F |ρ=0 = f,

(2.2)

for all s ∈ C unless s(n − s) belongs to the pure point spectrum of − g + . Now, the scattering
operator on M is defined as S(s)f = H |M , it is a meromorphic family of pseudo-differential
operators in Re(s) > n/2. The values s = n/2, n/2 + 1, n/2 + 2, . . . are simple poles of finite
rank, these are known as the trivial poles; S(s) may have other poles, however, for the rest of the
paper we assume that we are not in those exceptional cases.
We define the conformally covariant fractional powers of the Laplacian as follows: for s =

With this choice of multiplicative factor, the principal symbol of Pγ is exactly the principal

We define the Qγ curvature of the metric associated to the functional Pγ , to be
Qγ g + , gˆ := Pγ g + , gˆ (1).

(2.6)

In particular, for a change of metric as (2.4), we obtain the equation for the Qγ curvature:
n+2γ

Pγ g + , gˆ (v) = v n−2γ Qγ g + , gˆ v .
When γ is an integer, say γ = k, k ∈ N, a careful study of the poles of S(s) allows to define Pk .
Indeed,

These are the conformally invariant powers of the Laplacian constructed in the classical GJMS
paper by Graham et al. [15], or Fefferman and Graham [11], that are local operators, and satisfy
Pk = (− )k + lower order terms.
In particular, when k = 1 we have the conformal Laplacian,

Finally, we note that another realization of the conformal fractional powers of the Laplacian

Caffarelli and Silvestre have developed in [6] an equivalent definition, in the case γ ∈ (0, 1),
n
using an extension problem to the upper half-space Rn+1
+ . For a function f : R → R, we construct the extension U : Rn × [0, +∞) → R, U = U (x, y), as the solution of the equation

where
γ=

Note that Eq. (3.1) can be written as a divergence equation
div y a ∇U = 0 in Rn+1

which is degenerate elliptic. Then the fractional Laplacian of f can be computed as

(3.2)

where the constant dγ is defined in (2.3). We are indeed looking at a non-local Dirichlet to

in Rn is

and thus U = Kγ ∗x f .
The main observation we make in this section is that, in the case M = Rn and X = Rn+1

with coordinates x ∈ Rn , y > 0, endowed the hyperbolic metric gH = dy +|dx|
, the scattering
y2
operator is nothing but the Caffarelli–Silvestre extension problem for the fractional Laplacian
when γ ∈ (0, 1). After that, we give the generalization of the result by Caffarelli and Silvestre
for other exponents γ ∈ (0, n2 )\N. For simplicity, we write Pγ := Pγ [gH , |dx|2 ], where |dx|2 is
the Euclidean metric on Rn .

Proof. Fix f on Rn and let u be a solution of the scattering problem
−

H u − s(n − s)u = 0

in X.

(3.4)

We know that u can be written as
u = y n−s F + y s H,

(3.5)

where F |y=0 = f and S(s)f = h for h = H |y=0 . Moreover,
F (x, y) = f (x) + f2 (x)y 2 + o y 2

and H (x, y) = h(x) + h2 (x)y 2 + o y 2 .

For the second part of the lemma, note that

(3.12)

where h is given in (3.6). On the other hand, we also have that
U = y s−n u = F + y 2s−n H,
and thus, looking at the orders of y in (3.6), we can conclude that the limit
lim y a ∂y U

(3.13)

y→0

exists and equals h times the constant 2γ . The lemma is proven by comparing (3.13) together
with (3.12), with the Caffarelli and Silvestre construction for the fractional Laplacian as given
in (3.2). ✷
The next step is to generalize Theorem 3.1 to other non-integer exponents γ . To do this, we
will first establish in Theorem 3.2 below that there are two ways to define the operator Pγ when
γ > 1, and the two definitions agree. We will then apply Theorem 3.1 generalize Theorem 3.1
to γ > 1.
The first way to define Pγ is the original definition of Graham and Zworski [17], that is
to define it using scattering matrix; thus when γ > 1, Pγ f agrees with a higher order term
in the power series expansion of the solution of a second order equation (e.g. Eq. (3.23)); the
other is to define it by iterating the work of Caffarelli and Silvestre resulting in a PDE of order higher than 2, one can represent Pγ f0 as a lower order term in the power series expansion
of the solution of this PDE (e.g. Eq. (3.22)); we will show that the two definitions agree (see
claim (3.16)).
First, fixed γ ∈ (0, n2 )\N, if γ = m + γ0 , for m = [γ ] ∈ N, γ0 ∈ (0, 1), we can define the
fractional Laplacian on Rn inductively as
(−

γ
x)

= (−

γ0
x)

◦ (−

m
x) .

We have:
Theorem 3.2. For any γ ∈ (0, n2 )\N, we have that
Pγ gH , |dx|2 = (−

γ
x) ,

where the fractional conformal Laplacian Pγ on Rn is defined as in (2.3).

(3.14)

S.-Y.A. Chang, M.d.M. González / Advances in Mathematics 226 (2011) 1410–1432

1417

Proof. The proof is by induction on m. We set up the following notation:
γj = γ − (m − j )
n
sj = + γj ,
2
aj = 1 − 2γj .

for j = 0, . . . , m.

For each j = 0, . . . , m, we set fj := (−

gH usj

Note that j < γj < j + 1,

m−j f .
x)

γm = γ ,

Then the eigenvalue problem

− sj (n − sj )uj = 0,

in Hn+1 ,

has a unique solution uj = Fj y n−sj + Hj y sj satisfying Fj |y=0 = fj . Set hj = Hj |y=0 . Then the
scattering operator is simply
Pγj fj = dγj S(sj )fj = hj .
We set Uj := y n−sj uj . The same computation as in the proof of Theorem 3.1 gives that Uj is a
solution of
Uj +

aj
∂y Uj = 0.
y

(3.15)

On the other hand, since γ0 ∈ (0, 1), Theorem 3.1 applied to U0 implies that
1
lim y a0 ∂y U0 ,
2γ0 y→0

h0 =

and this limit is well defined.
We already know from Theorem 3.1 that Pγ0 = (−
f0 = (− x )m f . Now we claim that

γ0
x) .

On the other hand, by construction

Pγ0 f0 = Pγ f,

(3.16)

or equivalently, because of the definition of Pγ as in (2.3),
dγ0 h0 = dγ hm .

(3.17)

The proof of the theorem will be completed if we show claim (3.16).
We claim first that
Um = −

am
Um−1
1 + am

in Rn+1

(3.18)

Indeed, as mentioned above in (3.15), Um is a solution of
Um +

∂y Um = 0.
y

(3.19)

1418

S.-Y.A. Chang, M.d.M. González / Advances in Mathematics 226 (2011) 1410–1432

Differentiating above expression with respect to y, we obtain
(∂y Um ) −

∂y Um − 2 ∂yy Um + ∂yyy Um = 0.

(3.21)

Substitute (3.20) into (3.21) and take into account that am = am−1 − 2. This proves that
2

Um +

am−1
∂y ( Um ) = 0.
y

(3.22)

Next, note from (3.15) that the function Um−1 solves the equation
Um−1 +

am−1
∂y Um−1 = 0.
y

(3.23)

Thus we see from (3.22) and (3.23) that Um and Um−1 satisfy the same equation in Rn+1
+ . Let
us compare now the boundary values. First of all, by hypothesis,
Um−1 |y=0 = −

x f.

(3.24)

On the other hand, we claim that
Um |y=0 =

am
1 + am

x f.

(3.25)

The proof of this fact is a simple computation: we know that Um = Fm + y 2sm −n Hm where
Fm = f + bm y 2 + O(y 3 ) and Hm = hm + O(y 2 ). Then we can compute
Um |y=0 =

xf

+ 2bm

(3.26)

and y1 ∂y Um |y=0 = 2bm . From (3.19) we must have
bm =

xf

2(−1 − am )

.

Eq. (3.26) implies then
Um |y=0 =

am
1 + am

x f.

We have shown from (3.24) and (3.25) that Um and Um−1 have the same boundary values
(modulo a multiplicative constant). Since, as we have mentioned, they satisfy the same second
order elliptic equation, they must coincide in the whole Rn+1
+ . This is,
Um = −
as claimed in (3.27).

Um−1 ,
1 + am

(3.27)

S.-Y.A. Chang, M.d.M. González / Advances in Mathematics 226 (2011) 1410–1432

1419

Now we are ready to complete the proof of the theorem. From (3.27) and (3.19) we conclude
that
Um−1 =

1 + am
(∂y Um ).
y

(3.28)

We look at the asymptotic expansions for Um and Um−1 :
Um = Fm + y 2sm −n Hm ,

Fm = f m + O y 2 ,

Hm = hm + O y 2 ,

so that
1
1
1
∂y Um = ∂y Fm + (2sm − n)y 2sm −n−2 Hm + y 2sm −n ∂y Hm ,
y
y
y
while
Um−1 = Fm−1 + y 2sm−1 −n Hm−1 ,

Fm−1 = fm−1 + O y 2 ,

Hm−1 = hm−1 + O y 2 .

Since we have the relation (3.28), comparing the coefficients of the term y 2sm −n−2 = y 2sm−1 −n
we obtain that
(2sm − n)(1 + am )hm = hm−1 ,
which is
(2γm )hm = hm−1 .

(3.29)

We set
Am = 2m γm . . . γ1 ,

if m > 0, A0 = 1,

and
m

cm =

(aj + 1)

if m > 0, c0 = 1,

(3.30)

j =1

which will be necessary later. Applying (3.29) inductively we arrive at
Am cm hm = h0 .

(3.31)

But because
cm Am =

dγ
,
dγ0

then we have actually shown (3.17) and the theorem is proved.

Moreover, we have the following characterization for Pγ := Pγ [gH , |dx|2 ] as a Dirichlet-toNeumann operator, thus generalizing the result of Caffarelli and Silvestre for exponents γ ∈
(0, n2 )\N not necessarily less than one:
Theorem 3.3. Fix γ ∈ (0, n2 )\N, a = 1 − 2γ . Let f a smooth function defined on Rn , and let
U = U (x, y) be the solution of the boundary value problem
⎧
⎨ U + a ∂ U + ∂ U = 0 in Rn+1 ,

And, the following limit exists and we have the equality
Pγ f =

A lim y a0 ∂y y −1 ∂y y −1 ∂y . . . y −1 ∂y U
2γ0 m y→0

,

(3.32)

where we are taking m + 1 derivatives in the above expression, and the constant is given by
Am = 2m (γ − 1) . . . (γ − m + 1).

(3.33)

We are using the notation m = [γ ] ∈ N, γ0 = γ − m, a0 = 1 − 2γ0 , and the constant dγ as defined
in (2.3).
Proof. We keep the same notation as in the previous theorem. In this construction, U is precisely Um .
We would like to show first that
m+1 derivatives
cm
h0 =
lim y a0 ∂y y −1 ∂y y −1 . . . y −1 ∂y Um
2γ0 y→0

(3.34)

,

where the constant cm is defined in (3.30), and Pγ0 f0 = h0 . The proof goes by induction on m.
The case m = 0 is precisely the conclusion of Theorem 3.1. Assume that it is true for m − 1, i.e.,
m derivatives

h0 =
lim y ∂y y ∂y y −1 . . . y −1 ∂y Um−1

(3.35)

Now substitute (3.28) in (3.35) and use that cm = cm−1 (1 + am ). We immediately obtain (3.34).
Next, we recall relation (3.31) between hm and h0 . The definition of the operator Pγ f = dγ hm
and (3.34) complete the proof of the theorem. ✷

We fix γ ∈ (0, n2 )\N. In this section we discuss the generalization of Theorems 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3
from hyperbolic space to any conformally compact Einstein manifold (X, g + ).
First we write the extension problem analogous to (3.1) in a conformally compact Einstein
metric. The resulting problem (4.2) is still of divergence-type, degenerate elliptic, and with a
weight in the Muckenhoupt class A2 (cf. [23]), but some lower order terms appear—they depend
on the underlying geometry. This is the content of Lemma 4.1.
Next, we point out in Lemma 4.5 that, by choosing a suitable defining function ρ ∗ , which is
related to the eigenfunction of the Laplacian of the Einstein metric, Eq. (4.15) of the extension
theorem on general conformal compact Einstein manifolds is the same as the extension theorem
on hyperbolic space studied in Section 3, of pure divergence form.
Finally, in Theorems 4.7 and 4.8, we show how the extension problem with respect to this
new defining function allows to compute the fractional Paneitz operator Pγ .
Lemma 4.1. Let (X, g + ) be any conformally compact Einstein manifold with boundary M. For
any defining function ρ of M in X, not necessarily geodesic, the equation
−

g + u − s(n − s)u = 0

in X, g + ,

(4.1)

is equivalent to
− div ρ a ∇U + E(ρ)U = 0 in (X, g),

(4.2)

where
g¯ = ρ 2 g + ,

U = ρ s−n u

and the derivatives in (4.2) are taken with respect to the metric g.

✷

Let (X, g + ) be a conformally compact Einstein metric with boundary (M, [g]).
ˆ
Then,
Lemma 2.1 in [14] gives that, fixed a metric gˆ on the boundary M, there exists a unique defining
function y in X such that in the neighborhood M × (0, δ), the metric splits as

Lemma 4.1 is true for any defining function independent of the behavior near the boundary.
However, in the specific case that we have the splitting (4.7), then we can have a more explicit
expression for the lower order terms E(ρ):
Theorem 4.3. If the defining function (denoted by y in the following) is chosen such that metric
splits as (4.7) in a neighborhood M × (0, δ), then
E(y) =

Moreover, formula (3.32) for the calculation of the conformal fractional Laplacian is still true,

M = [γ ], γ0 = γ − m, a0 = 1 − 2γ0 , Am is given in (3.33) and dγ in (2.3).
Proof. The first assertion is a straightforward calculation from (4.3): we know that near {y = 0},
the metric g¯ can be split as g¯ = dy 2 + gy . Then

ˆ curRemark 4.4. Before we continue, we remind the reader of how to compute the Qγ [g + , g]
vature, as defined in (2.6), for γ ∈ (0, n2 )\N, s = n2 + γ . We set f ≡ 1, and find the solution to
the Poisson problem − g + v − s(n − s)v = 0 such that
v = Fy n−s + Hy s ,

F |y=0 = 1, H |y=0 = h.

Then,
Qγ g + , gˆ = dγ h.
Next, we show that it is possible to find a special defining function satisfying that the zero-th
order term E(ρ) in Eq. (4.2) vanishes so that the extension problem is a pure divergence equation
similar to the Euclidean one (3.1) studied in Section 3. We recover the conformal powers of the
Laplacian as the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator from Theorem 3.1 (or Theorems 3.2, 3.3), plus
a curvature term.
Lemma 4.5. Let (X, g + ) be a conformally compact Einstein manifold with conformal infinity
(M, [g]).
ˆ Fixed a metric gˆ on M, assume that y is the defining function on X such that on a
dy 2 +g

neighborhood M × (0, δ), the metric splits as g + = y 2 y , where gy is a one-parameter family
of metrics on M with gy |y=0 = g,
ˆ and Taylor expansion (4.8). For each γ ∈ (0, 1), there exists
another ( positive) defining function ρ ∗ on M × (0, δ), satisfying ρ ∗ = y + O(y 2γ +1 ), and such
that for the term E defined in (4.3) we have
E ρ ∗ ≡ 0.
Moreover, the metric g ∗ = (ρ ∗ )2 g + satisfies g ∗ |y=0 = gˆ and has asymptotic expansion
g ∗ = dρ ∗

(4.12)

Proof. We solve the eigenvalue problem (2.1) with Dirichlet condition (2.2) given by f ≡ 1, and
s = n2 + γ . The solution can be written as v = y n−s F + y s H for
F = 1 + O y2 ,

H = h + O y2 .

We set
ρ ∗ := v 1/(n−s) ;

(4.13)

1425

we emphasize that ρ ∗ is chosen as a power of the eigenfunction of g + at s = n2 + γ . We check
now that this ρ ∗ satisfies all the properties stated in the lemma.
First note that v solves the equation − g + v − s(n − s)v = 0. This quickly implies the vanishing of E(ρ ∗ ) if we use the equivalent formula (4.4). Next, the asymptotic behavior of ρ ∗ is
precisely
ρ ∗ (y) = y 1 +

hy 2γ + O y 2 .
n−s

(4.14)

ˆ On the other hand,
Moreover, because of Remark 4.4, we precisely have dγ h = Qγ [g + , g].
the asymptotic expansion (4.12) for g ∗ can be easily checked from (4.14) and the asymptotic
behavior of g¯ = dy 2 + gy (x), gy = gˆ + O(y 2 ).
Lemma 4.6. The ρ ∗ constructed in the previous lemma can be defined in the whole X and it is
indeed positive and smooth.
Proof. A summary of properties for degenerate elliptic equations, necessary to deal with (4.1)
or (4.2) can be found in González and Qing [13]. The classical reference on degenerate elliptic
equations with Muckenhoupt weights is Fabes et al. [10], while Cabré and Sire [3] have retaken
the study in relation to fractional Laplacians on Euclidean space.
Note that v is strictly positive in the whole X, thanks to the maximum principle and uniqueness for Eq. (4.1). This shows that ρ ∗ is an acceptable defining function on the whole X. ✷
Theorem 4.7. Assume the same hypothesis as in Lemma 4.5. Fix γ ∈ (0, 1) and let ρ ∗ be the
special defining function constructed in Lemma 4.5. For each smooth function f on M, let U
solve the extension problem
− div ρ ∗ ∇U = 0
U =f

ˆ is defined in Remark 4.4.
The fractional order curvature Qγ [g + , g]
Proof. We set up the same notation as in the previous results. On one hand, in order to compute
the scattering operator with Dirichlet data f we need to consider the equation
−

g + u − s(n − s)u = 0

in X, g + .

(4.17)

There exists a solution u = y n−s F + y s H with F = f + 0(y 2 ), H = h + O(y 2 ). Then Pγ f :=
Pγ [g + , g]f
ˆ is defined as Pγ f = dγ h.

1426

S.-Y.A. Chang, M.d.M. González / Advances in Mathematics 226 (2011) 1410–1432

On the other hand, the Qγ curvature can be computed as indicated in Remark 4.4. Let v be
the solution of the Poisson equation (4.17), but with Dirichlet identically f˜ ≡ 1. It can be written
as
v = y n−s F˜ + y s H˜

with F˜ = 1 + 0 y 2 , H˜ = h˜ + O y 2 .

˜ In addition, ρ ∗ = v 1/(n−s) .
Then Qγ := Pγ 1 = dγ h.
Now we claim that U := (ρ ∗ )s−n u satisfies (4.15). First, Lemma 4.1 applied to the defining
function ρ ∗ gives that U is a solution of (4.2). Second, for our special choice of defining function,
E(ρ ∗ ) = 0 thanks to Lemma 4.5. Finally, note that by construction,
U=

u F + y 2s−n H
=
.
v F˜ + y 2s−n H˜

In particular, U |y=0 = f . This shows that U is a solution of (4.15), as claimed.
Next, let us compute ∂y U . It is easy to check that
˜
lim y a ∂y U = (2γ )h − 2γf h,

y→0

and (4.16) follows. This completes the proof of Theorem 4.7.

✷

Before we state the next result, we need to introduce some notations: for any smooth function w, we denote w = OE (1) if the function w has only even terms in the expansion (up to
order n), i.e.,
w = w 0 + w 1 y 2 + w2 y 4 + · · · .
We also define the operator B := y −1 ∂y . We claim that for any k = 1, 2, . . . , it is true that:
1. If w = OE (1), then also B k w = OE (1).
2. If w = hy l OE (1) for some function h = h(x) and l ∈ N, then
B k w = l(l − 2) . . . l − 2(k − 1) y l−2k h + O y l−2k+1
and
∂y B k w = l(l − 2) . . . l − 2(k − 1) (l − 2k)y l−2k−1 h + O y l−2k .
We show now that Theorem 4.7 is still valid for any exponent γ ∈ (0, n2 )\N, thus generalizing
Theorem 3.3 on hyperbolic space to any conformally compact Einstein manifold:
Theorem 4.8. Fix s = n2 + γ for γ ∈ (0, n2 )\N. Set γ = m + γ0 , m = [γ ], γ0 ∈ (0, 1), a = 1 − 2γ .

From this sum, only the terms k = 0, k = m are important, since the rest are of higher order in y.

so that
∂y B m V W −1 = O(y) + 2γ0 Am y 2γ0 −1 h + h.o.t.
On the other hand, for the k = 0 term we observe that
B m W −1 = −B m (W )/W 2 + h.o.t.,
and thus
∂y V B m W −1

5. The general case
¯ there exists
Given a compact manifold X¯ with boundary M, and a smooth metric g¯ on X,
an asymptotically hyperbolic metric with constant scalar curvature in the interior X, in the same
conformal class of g.
¯ This is the well known singular Yamabe problem, that has been well understood in a series of papers. We should cite Aviles and MacOwen [2], Mazzeo [21], Andersson
et al. [1], in the case of negative constant scalar curvature.
We remark now that the construction of scattering operator S(s) can be generalized to manifolds which are not Einstein, but just asymptotically hyperbolic (cf. Mazzeo and Melrose [22]
for most of the values of the parameter s, and Guillarmou [18] for a closer look at the remaining poles). In this section we try to understand how many of the results in the previous sections
¯ g),
generalize to a compact manifold with boundary (X,
¯ not necessarily conformally compact
Einstein. For the rest of the section, γ ∈ (0, 1).
The case γ = 12 was studied by Gillarmou and Guillopé [19]. They considered the scattering
operator of asymptotically hyperbolic manifold, and its relation to mean curvature. Note that
γ = 12 is a splitting point for the behavior of Pγ , as we will see in Theorem 5.1.
¯ g)
Let (X,
¯ be a smooth (n + 1)-dimensional compact manifold with boundary M n = ∂X. As
we have mentioned above, there exists an asymptotically hyperbolic metric g + in the interior
X, conformal to g,
¯ and that has negative constant scalar curvature Rg + = −n(n + 1). Moreover,
g + has a very specific polyhomogeneous expansion. More precisely, let ρ be a geodesic boundary
¯ g),
defining function of (∂ X,
¯ i.e.,
g¯ = dρ 2 + g¯ ρ
for some one-parameter family of metrics g¯ ρ on M, then we have that
g+ =

¯ Here we note that the log terms do not appear

in the first terms of the expansion, and they can be ignore in our setting, because γ ∈ (0, 1) and
we will not need such high orders. We define

1429

On the other hand, note that g¯ ρ may not only have even terms in its expansion. However, by
¯ M , we can find a
the work of Graham and Lee [16], fixed the boundary metric gˆ := g¯ ρ |ρ=0 = g|
boundary defining function y = ρ + O(ρ 2 ) such that
g+ =

near M, where gy is a one-parameter family of metrics on M such that gy |y=0 = g,
regularity of ρα + ρ n β. The main property of gy is that, if we make the expansion
gy = g (0) + g (1) y + O y 2 ,
then
ˆ
g (0) = g,

traceg (0) g (1) = 0.

(5.6)

We set g˜ = dy 2 + gy so that
g+ =

g˜
.
y2

(5.7)

The scattering operator for (X, g + ) is computed as follows: first, solve the Poisson equation
− g + u − s(n − s)u = 0. For each f ∈ C ∞ (M), there exists a solution of the form
u = y n−s F + y s H,
Then, for s =

n
2

F = f + O y 2 , H = h + O(y).

(5.8)

+ γ , we define the conformal fractional Laplacian in this setting as
Pγ g + , gˆ f = dγ h.

(5.9)

In our case, we do have some log terms in the expansion (5.2). However, they do appear at
order n, and consequently, they do not change the first terms in the asymptotic expansion for u.
We write
ρˆ = y 1 + yφ + O y 2

(5.10)

for some φ ∈ C ∞ (∂X) which will be made precise later. Because the metrics (5.4) and (5.7) are
˜ Then, restricting to the tangential direction, we get that
equal, we can write y 2 g¯ = ρˆ 2 g.
1 + 2yφ + O y 2 gy = g¯ ρ .

(5.11)

We write the Taylor expansions for gy and g¯ ρ in the variable y, taking into account that ρ =
y + O(y 2 ):
gy = g (0) + g (1) y + O y 2 ,

g (0) = g,
ˆ

g¯ ρ = g¯ (0) + g¯ (1) y + O y 2 ,

g¯ (0) = g,

g (1) = 0,
(5.12)

1430

S.-Y.A. Chang, M.d.M. González / Advances in Mathematics 226 (2011) 1410–1432

then looking at the orders of y in (5.11), we obtain
g (1) + φ gˆ = g¯ (1) .
Taking trace above with respect to g,

Proof. We follow the notations in the previous paragraphs. It is possible to find an asymptotically hyperbolic metric g + on X, of the form (5.1). We define the new functions ρˆ as (5.3),
and y satisfying (5.5). Then we have seen that it is possible to define the scattering operator
for the metric (X, g + ), as follows: let u be the solution of the eigenvalue problem − g + u −
s(n − s)u = 0, with given data f . Its asymptotic expansion is given in (5.8), u = y n−s F + y s H ,
Fy=0 = f , H |y=0 = h, while the scattering operator is just Pγ = dγ h.
Second, Lemma 4.1 applied to the defining function ρˆ shows that
U := ρˆ s−n u
is the solution of (5.18), since g¯ = ρˆ 2 g + .
Next, we have shown in (5.15) that
ρˆ = y 1 − yΨ0 + O y 2 ,
so that we can expand U as
U = f − (s − n)Ψ0 y + O y 2

+ y 2s−n h + O(y) .

Then

Now we take the limit above when y → 0. It is clear that the limit exists if and only if a
unless Ψ0 = 0. In particular, if γ < 12 , then

0,

lim y a ∂y U = (2s − n)h,

y→0

as desired. For the case γ = 12 , just note that d 1 = −1.
