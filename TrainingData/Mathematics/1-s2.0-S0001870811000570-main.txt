Abstract
We consider the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of finite, low rank perturbations of random matrices.
Specifically, we prove almost sure convergence of the extreme eigenvalues and appropriate projections of
the corresponding eigenvectors of the perturbed matrix for additive and multiplicative perturbation models.
The limiting non-random value is shown to depend explicitly on the limiting eigenvalue distribution of
the unperturbed random matrix and the assumed perturbation model via integral transforms that correspond
to very well-known objects in free probability theory that linearize non-commutative free additive and
multiplicative convolution. Furthermore, we uncover a phase transition phenomenon whereby the large
matrix limit of the extreme eigenvalues of the perturbed matrix differs from that of the original matrix
if and only if the eigenvalues of the perturbing matrix are above a certain critical threshold. Square root
decay of the eigenvalue density at the edge is sufficient to ensure that this threshold is finite. This critical
threshold is intimately related to the same aforementioned integral transforms and our proof techniques
bring this connection and the origin of the phase transition into focus. Consequently, our results extend the

class of ‘spiked’ random matrix models about which such predictions (called the BBP phase transition) can
be made well beyond the Wigner, Wishart and Jacobi random ensembles found in the literature. We examine
the impact of this eigenvalue phase transition on the associated eigenvectors and observe an analogous phase
transition in the eigenvectors. Various extensions of our results to the problem of non-extreme eigenvalues
are discussed.

1. Introduction
Let Xn be an n × n symmetric (or Hermitian) matrix with eigenvalues λ1 (Xn ), . . . , λn (Xn )
and Pn be an n × n symmetric (or Hermitian) matrix with rank r n and non-zero eigenvalues
θ1 , . . . , θr . A fundamental question in matrix analysis is the following [14,2]:
How are the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Xn + Pn related to the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Xn and Pn ?
When Xn and Pn are diagonalized by the same eigenvectors, we have λi (Xn + Pn ) = λj (Xn ) +
λk (Pn ) for appropriate choice of indices i, j, k ∈ {1, . . . , n}. In the general setting, however, the
answer is complicated by the fact that the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of their sum depend on
the relationship between the eigenspaces of the individual matrices.
In this scenario, one can use Weyl’s interlacing inequalities and Horn inequalities [24] to
obtain coarse bounds for the eigenvalues of the sum in terms of the eigenvalues of Xn . When
the norm of Pn is small relative to the norm of Xn , tools from perturbation theory (see [24,
Chapter 6] or [39]) can be employed to improve the characterization of the bounded set in which
the eigenvalues of the sum must lie. Exploiting any special structure in the matrices allows us to
refine these bounds [26] but this is pretty much as far as the theory goes. Instead of exact answers
we must resort to a system of coupled inequalities. Describing the behavior of the eigenvectors
of the sum is even more complicated.
Surprisingly, adding some randomness to the eigenspaces permits further analytical progress.
Specifically, if the eigenspaces are assumed to be “in generic position with respect to each other”, then in place of eigenvalue bounds we have simple, exact answers that are to be interpreted
probabilistically. These results bring into focus a phase transition phenomenon of the kind illustrated in Fig. 1 for the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Xn + Pn and Xn × (In + Pn ). A precise
statement of the results may be found in Section 2.
Examining the structure of the analytical expression for the critical values θc and ρ in Fig. 1
reveals a common underlying theme in the additive and multiplicative perturbation settings. The
critical values θc and ρ in Fig. 1 are related to integral transforms of the limiting eigenvalue
distribution μX of Xn . It turns out that the integral transforms that emerge in the respective
additive and multiplicative cases are deeply related to very well-known objects in free probability theory [40,23,1] that linearize free additive and multiplicative convolutions respectively.
In a forthcoming paper [13], we consider the analogue of the problem for the extreme singular
values of finite rank deformations of rectangular random matrices. There too, a phase transition occurs at a threshold determined by an integral transform which plays an analogous role in

Fig. 1. Assume that the limiting eigenvalue distribution of Xn is μX with largest eigenvalue b. Consider the matrix
Pn := θuu∗ with rank r = 1 and largest eigenvalue θ (> 0, say). The vector u is an n × 1 vector chosen uniformly at
random from the unit n-sphere. The largest eigenvalue of Xn + Pn will differ from b if and only if θ is greater than some
critical value θc . In this event, the largest eigenvalue will be concentrated around ρ with high probability as in (a). The
associated eigenvector u will, with high probability, lie on a cone around u as in (b). When θ θc , a phase transition
occurs so that with high probability, the largest eigenvalue of the sum will equal b as in (c) and the corresponding
eigenvector will be uniformly distributed on the unit sphere as in (d). (For interpretation of the references to color in this
figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)

the computation of the rectangular additive free convolution [7,8,10,9]. The emergence of these
transforms in the context of the study of the extreme or isolated eigenvalue behavior should be
of independent interest to free probabilists. In doing so, we extend the results found in the literature about the so-called BBP phase transition (named after Baik, Ben Arous, Péché because of
their seminal paper [4]) for the eigenvalue phase transition in such finite, low rank perturbation
models well beyond the Wigner [33,25,20,15,6], Wishart [4,5,19,32,31] and Jacobi settings [30].
In our situation, the distribution μX in Fig. 1 can be any probability measure. Consequently,
the aforementioned results in the literature can be rederived rather simply using the formulas
in Section 2 by substituting μX with the semi-circle measure [41] (for Wigner matrices), the
Marˇcenko–Pastur measure [29] (for Wishart matrices) or the free Jacobi measure (for Jacobi
matrices [16]). Concrete computations are presented in Section 3.
The development of the eigenvector aspect is another contribution that we would like to
highlight. Generally speaking, the eigenvector question has received less attention in random
matrix theory and in free probability theory. A notable exception is the recent body of work
on the eigenvectors of spiked Wishart matrices [32,25,31] which corresponds to μX being the

Marˇcenko–Pastur measure. In this paper, we extend their results for multiplicative models of the
kind (I + Pn )1/2 Xn (I + Pn )1/2 to the setting where μX is an arbitrary probability measure and
obtain new results for the eigenvectors for additive models of the form Xn + Pn .
Our proofs rely on the derivation of master equation representations of the eigenvalues and
eigenvectors of the perturbed matrix and the subsequent application of concentration inequalities
for random vectors uniformly distributed on high dimensional unit spheres (such as the ones appearing in [21,22]) to these implicit master equation representations. Consequently, our technique
is simpler, more general and brings into focus the source of the phase transition phenomenon.
The underlying methods can and have been adapted to study the extreme singular values and
singular vectors of deformations of rectangular random matrices, as well as the fluctuations [11]
and the large deviations [12] of our model.
The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we state the main results and present the integral transforms alluded to above. Section 3 presents some examples. An outline of the proofs is
presented in Section 4. Exact master equation representations of the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors of the perturbed matrices are derived in Section 5 and utilized in Section 6 to prove the
main results. Technical results needed in these proofs have been relegated to Appendix A.
2. Main results
2.1. Definitions and hypotheses
Let Xn be an n × n symmetric (or Hermitian) random matrix whose ordered eigenvalues we
denote by λ1 (Xn ) · · · λn (Xn ). Let μXn be the empirical eigenvalue distribution, i.e., the
probability measure defined as
μXn

1
=
n

n

δλj (Xn ) .
j =1

Assume that the probability measure μXn converges almost surely weakly, as n → ∞, to a nonrandom compactly supported probability measure μX . Let a and b be, respectively, the infimum
and supremum of the support of μX . We suppose the smallest and largest eigenvalue of Xn
converge almost surely to a and b.
For a given r 1, let θ1 · · · θr be deterministic non-zero real numbers, chosen independently of n. For every n, let Pn be an n × n symmetric (or Hermitian) random matrix having
rank r with its r non-zero eigenvalues equal to θ1 , . . . , θr . Let the index s ∈ {0, . . . , r} be defined
such that θ1 · · · θs > 0 > θs+1 · · · θr .
Recall that a symmetric (or Hermitian) random matrix is said to be orthogonally invariant (or
unitarily invariant) if its distribution is invariant under the action of the orthogonal (or unitary)
group under conjugation.
We suppose that Xn and Pn are independent and that either Xn or Pn is orthogonally (or
unitarily) invariant.

we also let −
−→ denote almost sure convergence. The ordered eigenvalues of an n × n Hermitian
matrix M will be denoted by λ1 (M) · · · λn (M). Lastly, for a subspace F of an Euclidean
space E and a vector x ∈ E, we denote the norm of the orthogonal projection of x onto F
by x, F .

2.3. Extreme eigenvalues and eigenvectors under additive perturbations
Consider the rank r additive perturbation of the random matrix Xn given by
Xn = Xn + Pn .

eigenvalue depending on whether θ > 0 or θ < 0, respectively. Then we have

as n → ∞.
The following proposition allows to assert that in many classical matrix models, such as
Wigner or Wishart matrices, the above phase transitions actually occur with a finite threshold.
The proposition is phrased in terms of b, the supremum of the support of μX , but also applies
for a, the infimum of the support of μX . The proof relies on a straightforward computation which
we omit.
Proposition 2.4 (Edge density decay condition and the phase transition). Assume that the limiting eigenvalue distribution μX has a density fμX with a power decay at b, i.e., that, as t → b
with t < b, fμX (t) ∼ c(b − t)α for some exponent α > −1 and some constant c. Then:
GμX b+ < ∞

⇐⇒

α > 0 and GμX b+ = −∞

⇐⇒

Remark 2.5. The edge density decays as a square root for many random matrix ensembles studied in the literature [38,27]. Proposition 2.4 reveals why low rank perturbations of these random
matrices will cause both the eigenvalue and eigenvector phase transitions as predicted in Theorems 2.1 and 2.3. Higher order edge density decay occurs in other well-studied random matrix
ensembles [18] and Proposition 2.4 brings into focus settings (specifically when α > 1) where
the eigenvalue phase transition may not be accompanied by an eigenvector phase transition.
Remark 2.6 (Necessity of eigenvalue repulsion for the eigenvector phase transition). Under ada.s.
−→ μX
ditional hypotheses on the manner in which the empirical eigenvalue distribution of Xn −
as n → ∞, Theorem 2.2 can be generalized to any eigenvalue with limit ρ equal either to a
or b such that GμX (ρ) is finite. In the same way, Theorem 2.3 can be generalized for any value
of r. The specific hypothesis has to do with requiring the spacings between the λi (Xn )’s to be
more “random matrix like” and exhibit repulsion instead of being “independent sample like”
with possible clumping. We plan to develop this line of inquiry in a separate paper.
2.4. Extreme eigenvalues and eigenvectors under multiplicative perturbations
We maintain the same hypotheses as before so that the limiting probability measure μX , the
index s and the rank r matrix Pn are defined as in Section 2.1. In addition, we assume that for
every n, Xn is a non-negative definite matrix and that the limiting probability measure μX is not
the Dirac mass at zero.

The analogue of Remark 2.6 also applies here.
Remark 2.11 (Eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a similarity transformation of Xn ). Consider the
matrix Sn = (In + Pn )1/2 Xn (In + Pn )1/2 . The matrices Sn and Xn = Xn (In + Pn ) are related
by a similarity transformation and hence share the same eigenvalues and consequently the same
limiting eigenvalue behavior in Theorem 2.7. Additionally, if ui is a unit-norm eigenvector of Xn
then wi = (In + Pn )1/2 ui is an eigenvector of Sn and the unit-norm eigenvector vi = wi / wi

defined as
Gμ (z) =

dμ(t)

for z ∈

If [a, b] denotes the convex hull of the support of μ, then

exist in [−∞, 0) and (0, +∞], respectively and Gμ (·) realizes decreasing homeomorphisms
from (−∞, a) onto (Gμ (a − ), 0) and from (b, +∞) onto (0, Gμ (b+ )). Throughout this paper,
we shall denote by G−1
μ (·) the inverses of these homeomorphisms, even though Gμ can also
define other homeomorphisms on the holes of the support of μ.
The R-transform, defined as
Rμ (z) := G−1
μ (z) − 1/z,
is the analogue of the logarithm of the Fourier transform for free additive convolution. The free
additive convolution of probability measures on the real line is denoted by the symbol and can

Let An and Bn be independent n × n symmetric (or Hermitian) random matrices that are invariant, in law, by conjugation by any orthogonal (or unitary) matrix. Suppose that, as n → ∞,

which realizes decreasing homeomorphisms from (−∞, a) onto (Tμ (a − ), 0) and from (b, +∞)
onto (0, Tμ (b+ )). Throughout this paper, we shall denote by Tμ−1 the inverses of these homeomorphisms, even though Tμ can also define other homeomorphisms on the holes of the support
of μ.
The S-transform, defined as

is the analogue of the Fourier transform for free multiplicative convolution . The free multiplicative convolution of two probability measures μA and μB is denoted by the symbols and

The connection between free multiplicative convolution and Tμ−1 (via the S-transform) and the
appearance of Tμ−1 in Theorem 2.7 could be of independent interest to free probabilists.
2.6. Extensions
Remark 2.12 (Phase transition in non-extreme eigenvalues). Theorem 2.1 can easily be adapted
to describe the phase transition in the eigenvalues of Xn + Pn which fall in the “holes” of the
support of μX . Consider c < d such that almost surely, for n large enough, Xn has no eigenvalue
in the interval (c, d). It implies that GμX induces a decreasing homeomorphism, that we shall
denote by GμX ,(c,d) , from the interval (c, d) onto the interval (GμX (d − ), GμX (c+ )). Then it can
be proved that almost surely, for n large enough, Xn + Pn has no eigenvalue in the interval (c, d),
except if some of the 1/θi ’s are in the interval (GμX (d − ), GμX (c+ )), in which case for each such
index i, one eigenvalue of Xn + Pn has limit G−1
μX ,(c,d) (1/θi ) as n → ∞.
Remark 2.13 (Isolated eigenvalues of Xn outside the support of μX ). Theorem 2.1 can also
easily be adapted to the case where Xn itself has isolated eigenvalues in the sense that some of
its eigenvalues have limits out of the support of μX . More formally, let us replace the assumption
that the smallest and largest eigenvalues of Xn tend to the infimum a and the supremum b of the
support of μX by the following one.
There exist some real numbers
+

1 , . . . , p+

such that for all 1

Then an attentive look at the proof of Theorem 2.1 shows that it still holds, in the following sense
(we only present the point of view of the largest eigenvalues): the matrix Xn still has eigenvalues
tending to the +
i s such that θi > 1/GμX (b+ ), one eigenvalue
j ’s, but also, for each 1
−1
tending to GμX (1/θi ), all other largest eigenvalues tending to b.
Remark 2.14 (Other perturbations of Xn ). The previous remark forms the√basis for an√iterative
application of our theorems to other perturbational models, such as X = X(I + P ) X + Q
for example. Another way to deal with such perturbations is to first derive the corresponding
master equations representations that describe how the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of X are
related to the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of X and the perturbing matrices, along the lines of
Proposition 5.1 for additive or multiplicative perturbations of Hermitian matrices.

Remark 2.15 (Random matrices with Haar-like eigenvectors). Let G be an n × m Gaussian
random matrix with independent real (or complex) entries that are normally distributed with
mean 0 and variance 1. Then the matrix X = GG∗ /m is orthogonally (or unitarily) invariant.
Hence one can choose an orthonormal basis (U1 , . . . , Un ) of eigenvectors of X such that the
matrix U with columns U1 , . . . , Un is Haar-distributed. When G is a Gaussian-like matrix, in
the sense that its entries are i.i.d. with mean zero and variance one, then upon placing adequate
restrictions on the higher order moments, for non-random unit-norm vector xn , the vector U ∗ xn
will be close to uniformly distributed on the unit real (or complex) sphere [35–37]. Since our
proofs rely heavily on the properties of unit-norm vectors uniformly distributed on the n-sphere,
they could possibly be adapted to the setting where the unit-norm vectors are close to uniformly
distributed.

apply in this case.
The analogues of Remarks 2.12, 2.13, 2.15 and 2.16 for the multiplicative setting also hold
here. In particular, Wishart matrices with c > 1 (cf Section 3.2) gives an illustration of the case
where there is a hole in the support of μX .
3. Examples
We now illustrate our results with some concrete computations. The key to applying our results lies in being able to compute the Cauchy or T -transforms of the probability measure μX
and their associated functional inverses. In what follows, we focus on settings where the transforms and their inverses can be expressed in closed form. In settings where the transforms are
algebraic so that they can be represented as solutions of polynomial equations, the techniques
and software developed in [34] can be utilized. In more complicated settings, one will have to
resort to numerical techniques.
3.1. Additive perturbation of a Gaussian Wigner matrix
Let Xn be an n × n symmetric (or Hermitian) matrix with independent, zero mean, normally
distributed entries with variance σ 2 /n on the diagonal and σ 2 /(2n) on the off diagonal. It is
known that the spectral measure of Xn converges almost surely to the famous semi-circle distribution with density

When c > 1, there is an atom at zero so that the smallest eigenvalue of Xn is identically zero.

the eigenvalues of Sn as well. This result for the largest eigenvalue of spiked sample covariance
matrices was established in [4,32] and for the extreme eigenvalues in [5].
In the setting where r = 1 and P = θ uu∗ , let l = θ + 1 and let u be a unit-norm eigenvector
of Xn (I + Pn ) associated with its largest (or smallest, depending on whether l > 1 or l < 1)

The result has been established in [32] for the eigenvector associated with the largest eigenvalue.
We generalize it to the eigenvector associated with the smallest one.
We note that symmetry considerations imply that when X is a Wigner matrix then −X is
a Wigner matrix as well. Thus an analytical characterization of the largest eigenvalue of a Wigner
matrix directly yields a characterization of the smallest eigenvalue as well. This trick cannot be
applied for Wishart matrices since Wishart matrices do not exhibit the symmetries of Wigner
matrices. Consequently, the smallest and largest eigenvalues and their associated eigenvectors of
Wishart matrices have to be treated separately. Our results facilitate such a characterization.
4. Outline of the proofs
We now provide an outline of the proofs. We focus on Theorems 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3, which
describe the phase transition in the extreme eigenvalues and associated eigenvectors of X + P
(the index n in Xn and Pn has been suppressed for brevity). An analogous argument applies for
the multiplicative perturbation setting.
Consider the setting where r = 1, so that P = θ uu∗ , with u being a unit-norm column vector.
Since either X or P is assumed to be invariant, in law, under orthogonal (or unitary) conjugation,
one can, without loss of generality, suppose that X = diag(λ1 , . . . , λn ) and that u is uniformly
distributed on the unit n-sphere.
4.1. Largest eigenvalue phase transition
The eigenvalues of X + P are the solutions of the equation
det zI − (X + P ) = 0.
Equivalently, for z so that zI − X is invertible, we have

F. Benaych-Georges, R.R. Nadakuditi / Advances in Mathematics 227 (2011) 494–521

507

zI − (X + P ) = (zI − X) · I − (zI − X)−1 P ,
so that
det zI − (X + P ) = det(zI − X) · det I − (zI − X)−1 P .
Consequently, a simple argument reveals that the z is an eigenvalue of X + P and not an eigenvalue of X if and only if 1 is an eigenvalue of the matrix (zI − X)−1 P . But (zI − X)−1 P =
(zI − X)−1 θ uu∗ has rank one, so its only non-zero eigenvalue will equal its trace, which in turn
is equal to θ Gμn (z), where μn is a “weighted” spectral measure of X, defined by
n

μn =

|uk |2 δλk

the uk ’s are the coordinates of u .

k=1

Thus any z outside the spectrum of X is an eigenvalue of X + P if and only if
n
k=1

|uk |2

z − λk

(1)

Eq. (1) describes the relationship between the eigenvalues of X + P and the eigenvalues of X
and the dependence on the coordinates of the vector u (via the measure μn ).
This is where randomization simplifies analysis. Since u is a random vector with uniform
distribution on the unit n-sphere, we have that for large n, |uk |2 ≈ n1 with high probability.
Consequently, we have μn ≈ μX so that Gμn (z) ≈ GμX (z). Inverting Eq. (1) after substituting these approximations yields the location of the largest eigenvalue to be G−1
μX (1/θ ) as in
Theorem 2.1.
The phase transition for the extreme eigenvalues emerges because under our assumption
that the limiting probability measure μX is compactly supported on [a, b], the Cauchy transform GμX is defined outside [a, b] and unlike what happens for Gμn , we do not always
have GμX (b+ ) = +∞. Consequently, when 1/θ < GμX (b+ ), we have that λ1 (X) ≈ G−1
μX (1/θ )
+
as before. However, when 1/θ
GμX (b ), the phase transition manifests and λ1 (X) ≈
λ1 (X) = b.
An extension of these arguments for fixed r > 1 yields the general result and constitutes
the most transparent justification, as sought by the authors in [4], for the emergence of this
phase transition phenomenon in such perturbed random matrix models. We rely on concentration
inequalities to make the arguments rigorous.
4.2. Eigenvectors phase transition
Let u be a unit eigenvector of X + P associated with the eigenvalue z that satisfies (1). From
the relationship (X + P )u = zu, we deduce that, for P = θ uu∗ ,
(zI − X)u = P u = θ uu∗ u = θ u∗ u .u
implying that u is proportional to (zI − X)−1 u.

because u∗ u is a scalar ,

Eq. (2) describes the relationship between the eigenvectors of X + P and the eigenvalues of X
and the dependence on the coordinates of the vector u (via the measure μn ).
Here too, randomization simplifies analysis since for large n, we have μn ≈ μX and z ≈ ρ.
Consequently,
dμn (t)

An extension of these arguments for fixed r > 1 yields the general result and brings into focus
the connection between the eigenvalue phase transition and the associated eigenvector phase
transition. As before, concentration inequalities allow us to make these arguments rigorous.
5. The exact master equations for the perturbed eigenvalues and eigenvectors
In this section, we provide the r-dimensional analogues of the master equations (1) and (2)
employed in our outline of the proof.
Proposition 5.1. Let us fix some positive integers 1 r n. Let Xn = diag(λ1 , . . . , λn ) be a

way. ✷
6. Proof of Theorem 2.1
The sequence of steps described below yields the desired proof:
(1) The first, rather trivial, step in the proof of Theorem 2.1 is to use Weyl’s interlacing inequalities to prove that any extreme eigenvalue of Xn which does not tend to a limit in R\[a, b]
tends either to a or b.
(2) Then, we utilize the “master equations” of Section 5 to express the extreme eigenvalues
of Xn as the z’s such that a certain random r × r matrix Mn (z) is singular.
(3) We then exploit convergence properties of certain analytical functions (derived in Appendix A) to prove that almost surely, Mn (z) converges to a certain diagonal matrix
MGμX (z), uniformly in z.
(4) We then invoke a continuity lemma (see Lemma 6.1 – derived next) to claim that almost
surely, the z’s such that Mn (z) is singular (i.e. the extreme eigenvalues of Xn ) converge to
the z’s such that MGμX (z) is singular.
(5) We conclude the proof by noting that, for our setting, the z’s such that MGμX (z) is singular
are precisely the z’s such that for some i ∈ {1, . . . , r}, GμX (z) = θ1i . Part (ii) of Lemma 6.1,
about the rank of Mn (z), will be useful to assert that when the θi ’s are pairwise distinct, the
multiplicities of the isolated eigenvalues are all equal to one.

6.1. A continuity lemma for the zeros of certain analytic functions
We now prove a continuity lemma that will be used in the proof of Theorem 2.1. We note that
nothing in its hypotheses is random. As hinted earlier, we will invoke it to localize the extreme
eigenvalues of Xn .
For z ∈ C and E a closed subset of R, set d(z, E) = minx∈E |z − x|.
Lemma 6.1. Let us fix a positive integer r, a family θ1 , . . . , θr of pairwise distinct non-zero real
numbers, two real numbers a < b, an analytic function G(z) of the variable z ∈ C\[a, b] such
that
(a) G(z) ∈ R ⇐⇒ z ∈ R,
(b) for all z ∈ R\[a, b], G (z) < 0,
(c) G(z) → 0 as |z| → ∞.
Let us define, for z ∈ C\[a, b], the r × r matrix
MG (z) = diag 1 − θ1 G(z), . . . , 1 − θr G(z) ,

(8)

and denote by z1 > · · · > zp the z’s such that MG (z) is singular, where p ∈ {0, . . . , r} is identically equal to the number of i’s such that G(a − ) < 1/θi < G(b+ ).
Let us also consider two sequences an , bn with respective limits a, b and, for each n, a function
Mn (z), defined on z ∈ C\[an , bn ], with values in the set of r × r complex matrices such that the
entries of Mn (z) are analytic functions of z. We suppose that
(d) for all n, for all z ∈ C\R, the matrix Mn (z) is invertible,
(e) Mn (z) converges, as n → ∞, to the function MG (z), uniformly on {z ∈ C; d(z, [a, b])
for all η > 0.

η},

Then
(i) there exists p real sequences zn,1 > · · · > zn,p converging respectively to z1 , . . . , zp such
that for any ε > 0 small enough, for n large enough, the z’s in R\[a − ε, b + ε] such that
Mn (z) is singular are exactly zn,1 , . . . , zn,p ,
(ii) for n large enough, for each i, Mn (zn,i ) has rank r − 1.
Proof. Note firstly that the z’s such that MG (z) is singular are the z’s such that for a certain
j ∈ {1, . . . , r},
1 − θj G(z) = 0.

(9)

Since the θj ’s are pairwise distinct, for any z, there cannot exist more than one j ∈ {1, . . . , r}
such that (9) holds. As a consequence, for all z, the rank of MG (z) is either r or r − 1. Since
the set of matrices with rank at least r − 1 is open in the set of r × r matrices, once (i) will be
proved, (ii) will follow.
Let us now prove (i). Note firstly that by (c), there exists R > max{|a|, |b|} such that for z
such that |z| R, |G(z)| mini 2|θ1 i | . For any such z, | det MG (z)| > 2−r . By (e), it follows that

F. Benaych-Georges, R.R. Nadakuditi / Advances in Mathematics 227 (2011) 494–521

511

for n large enough, the z’s such that Mn (z) is singular satisfy |z| > R. By (d), it even follows that
the z’s such that Mn (z) is singular satisfy z ∈ [−R, R].
Now, to prove (i), it suffices to prove that for all c, d ∈ R\([a, b] ∪ {z1 , . . . , zp }) such that
c < d < a or b < c < d, we have that as n → ∞:
(H) the number of z’s in (c, d) such that det Mn (z) = 0, denoted by Cardc,d (n) tends to Cardc,d ,
the cardinality of the i’s in {1, . . . , p} such that c < zi < d.
To prove (H), by additivity, one can suppose that c and d are close enough to have Cardc,d = 0
or 1. Let us define γ to be the circle with diameter [c, d]. By (a) and since c, d ∈
/ {z1 , . . . , zp },
det MG (·) does not vanish on γ , thus
Cardc,d =

(note that since Cardc,d = 0 or 1, no ambiguity due to the orders of the zeros has to be taken into
account here). ✷

Eqs. (11) and (12) are the first step in the proof of Theorem 2.1. They state that any extreme
eigenvalue of Xn which does not tend to a limit in R\[a, b] tends either to a or b. Let us now
prove the crux of the theorem related to the isolated eigenvalues.
6.2.2. Isolated eigenvalues in the setting where θ1 , . . . , θr are pairwise distinct
In this section, we assume that the eigenvalues θ1 , . . . , θr of the perturbing matrix Pn are
pairwise distinct. In the next section, we shall remove this hypothesis by an approximation process.
For a momentarily fixed n, let the eigenvalues of Xn be denoted by λ1 · · · λn . Consider
orthogonal (or unitary) n × n matrices UX , UP that diagonalize Xn and Pn , respectively, such
that
Xn = UX diag(λ1 , . . . , λn )UX∗ ,

Pn = UP diag(θ1 , . . . , θr , 0, . . . , 0)UP∗ .

The spectrum of Xn + Pn is identical to the spectrum of the matrix
UX∗ UP

diag(λ1 , . . . , λn ) +

diag(θ1 , . . . , θr , 0, . . . , 0)UP∗ UX .

(13)

denoted by Un

Since we have assumed that Xn or Pn is orthogonally (or unitarily) invariant and that they are
independent, this implies that Un is a Haar-distributed orthogonal (or unitary) matrix that is also
independent of (λ1 , . . . , λn ) (see the first paragraph of the proof of [23, Th. 4.3.5] for additional
details).
a.s.

Recall that the largest eigenvalue λ1 (Xn ) −
−→ b, while the smallest eigenvalue λn (Xn ) −
−→ a.
Let us now consider the eigenvalues of Xn which are out of [λn (Xn ), λ1 (Xn )]. By Proposition 5.1(a) and an application of the identity in Proposition 5.1(b) these eigenvalues are precisely
the numbers z ∈
/ [λn (Xn ), λ1 (Xn )] such that the r × r matrix
Mn (z) := Ir − θj Gμ(n) (z)

where uk,i and uk,j are the (k, i)-th and (k, j )-th entries of the orthogonal (or unitary) matrix Un
in (13) and λk is the k-th largest eigenvalue of Xn as in the first term in (13).
By Proposition A.3, we have that

Thus we have

Mn (z) −

(17)

and by Lemma A.1, this convergence is uniform on {z ∈ C; d(z, [a, b]) η > 0} for each η > 0.
We now note that hypotheses (a), (b) and (c) of Lemma 6.1 are satisfied and follow from the
definition of the Cauchy transform GμX . Hypothesis (d) of Lemma 6.1 follows from the fact that
Xn is Hermitian while hypothesis (e) has been established in (17).
Let us recall that the eigenvalues of Xn which are out of [λn (Xn ), λ1 (Xn )] are precisely those
values zn where the matrix Mn (zn ) is singular. As a consequence, we are now in a position where
Theorem 2.1 follows by invoking Lemma 6.1. Indeed, by Lemma 6.1, if
z1 > · · · > zp
denote the solutions of the equation
r

1 − θi GμX (z) = 0

z ∈ R\[a, b] ,

i=1

then there exist some sequences (zn,1 ), . . . , (zn,p ) converging respectively to z1 , . . . , zp such that
for any ε > 0 small enough, for n large enough, the eigenvalues of Xn that are out of [a − ε, b + ε]
are exactly zn,1 , . . . , zn,p . Moreover, (5) and Lemma 6.1(ii) ensure that for n large enough, these
eigenvalues have multiplicity one.
6.2.3. Isolated eigenvalues in the setting where some θi ’s may coincide
We now treat the case where the θi ’s are not supposed to be pairwise distinct.
We denote, for θ = 0,

We shall treat only the case of largest eigenvalues (the case of smallest ones can be treated in
the same way). So let us fix 1 i s and ε > 0.
There is η > 0 such that |ρθ − ρθi | ε whenever |θ − θi | η. Consider pairwise distinct

7. Proof of Theorem 2.2
As in Section 6.2.2, let
Xn = UX diag(λ1 , . . . , λn )UX∗ ,

Pn = UP diag(θ1 , . . . , θr , 0, . . . , 0)UP∗ .

The eigenvectors of Xn + Pn , are precisely UX times the eigenvectors of
diag(λ1 , . . . , λn ) + UX∗ UP diag(θ1 , . . . , θr , 0, . . . , 0)UP∗ UX .
=Un

Consequently, we have proved Theorem 2.2 by proving the result in the setting where Xn =
diag(λ1 , . . . , λn ) and Pn = Un diag(θ1 , . . . , θr , 0, . . . , 0)Un∗ , where Un is a Haar-distributed orthogonal (or unitary) matrix.
(n)
As before, we denote the entries of Un by [ui,j ]ni,j =1 . Let the columns of Un be denoted by
u1 , . . . , un and the n × r matrix whose columns are respectively u1 , . . . , ur by Un,r . Note that
(n)
the ui ’s, as u, depend on n, hence should be denoted for example by ui and u(n) . The same, of
course, is true for the λi ’s and the λi ’s. To simplify our notation, we shall suppress the n in the
superscript.
Let r0 be the number of i’s such that θi = θi0 . Up to a reindexing of the θi ’s (which are
then no longer decreasing – this fact does not affect our proof), one can suppose that i0 = 1,
θ1 = · · · = θr0 . This choice implies that, for each n, ker(θ1 In − Pn ) is the linear span of the r0
first columns u1 , . . . , ur0 of Un . By construction, these columns are orthonormal. Hence, we will
prove Theorem 2.2 if we can prove that as n → ∞,

where, for all i, j = 1, . . . , r, μ(n)

Thus by (20), any limit point of Un,r u is in the kernel of the matrix on the right-hand side
of (21), i.e. has its r − r0 last coordinates equal to zero.
Thus (19) holds and we have proved Theorem 2.2(b). We now establish (18).
By (6), one has that for all n, the eigenvector u of Xn associated with the eigenvalue λi0 can

We first note that the GμX (b+ ) = −∞, implies that dμ

(b−t)2
the strategy employed in proving Theorem 2.2, and note that it suffices to prove the result in
the setting where Xn = diag(λ1 , . . . , λn ) and Pn = θ uu∗, where u is an n × 1 column vector

Appendix A. Convergence of weighted spectral measures
A.1. A few facts about the weak convergence of complex measures
Recall that a sequence (μn ) of complex measures on R is said to converge weakly to a complex
measure μ on R if, for any continuous bounded function f on R,
f (t) dμn (t) −
−−−→
n→∞

f (t) dμ(t).

(24)

We now establish a lemma on the weak convergence of complex measures that will be useful
in proving Proposition A.3. We note that the counterpart of this lemma for probability measures
is well known. We did not find any reference in standard literature to the “complex measures
version” stated next, so we provide a short proof.

518

F. Benaych-Georges, R.R. Nadakuditi / Advances in Mathematics 227 (2011) 494–521

Recall that a sequence (μn ) of complex measures on R is said to be tight if
lim sup |μn | t ∈ R; |t|

R→+∞ n

R

= 0.

Lemma A.1. Let D be a dense subset of the set of continuous functions on R tending to zero at
infinity endowed with the topology of the uniform convergence. Consider a tight sequence (μn )
of complex measures on R such that (|μn |(R)) is bounded and (24) holds for any function f
in D. Then (μn ) converges weakly to μ. Moreover, the convergence of (24) is uniform on any set
of uniformly bounded and uniformly Lipschitz functions.
Proof. Firstly, note that using the boundedness of (|μn |(R)), one can easily extend (24) to any
continuous function tending to zero at infinity. It follows that for any continuous bounded function f and any continuous function g tending to zero at infinity, we have
lim sup
n→∞

f d(μ − μn )

sup
n

f (1 − g) d |μ| + |μn | ,

which can be made arbitrarily small by appropriately choosing g. The tightness hypothesis ensures that such a g can always be found. This proves that (μn ) converges weakly to μ. The
uniform convergence follows from a straightforward application of Ascoli’s Theorem. ✷
A.2. Convergence of weighted spectral measures
Lemma A.2. For each n, let u(n) = (u1 , . . . , un ), v (n) = (v1 , . . . , vn ) be the first two rows of a
Haar-distributed random orthogonal (or unitary) matrix. Let x (n) = (x1 , . . . , xn ) be a set of realvalued random numbers1 independent of (u(n) , v (n) ). We suppose that supn,k |xk | < ∞ almost
surely.
(a) Then as n → ∞,
a.s.
u1 v1 x1 + u2 v2 x2 + · · · + un vn xn −
−→ 0.

(b) Suppose that n1 (x1 + x2 + · · · + xn ) converges almost surely to a deterministic limit l. Then
a.s.
−→ l.
|u1 |2 x1 + |u2 |2 x2 + · · · + |un |2 xn −

Proof. It is enough to prove the result in the setting where the x (n) ’s are deterministic. The
following argument illustrates why. Let us denote by F the σ -algebra generated by {x (n) ; n 1}.
Then we have that, for
Zn := u1 v1 x1 + · · · + un vn xn ,

Tn := |u1 |2 x1 + |u2 |2 x2 + · · · + |un |2 xn ,

P{Zn → 0, Tn → l} = E E[1Zn →0,Tn →l | F ] ,
1 Note that for each k, u , v and x obviously depend on n. We could have represented this dependence in the
k k
k
(n)
subscript as un,k or uk but we choose to suppress the n for notational brevity.

F. Benaych-Georges, R.R. Nadakuditi / Advances in Mathematics 227 (2011) 494–521

519

so it is enough to prove that almost surely,
E[1Zn →0,Tn →l | F ] = 1,
which amounts to establishing the result in the setting where the x (n) ’s are deterministic.
We begin our proof by assuming that the x (n) ’s are deterministic and show that (a) holds by
demonstrating that E[Zn4 ] = O(n−2 ). We have that:
n

E Zn4 =

xi xj xk xl E[ui uj uk ul vi vj vk vl ].
i,j,k,l=1

Since (u1 , . . . , un ) and (v1 , . . . , vn ) are the first two rows of a Haar-distributed random orthogonal (or unitary) matrix, we have that E[ui uj uk ul vi vj vk vl ] = 0 whenever one of the indices
i, j , k, l, is different from the others [17]. It follows that
E Zn4

xi2 xj2 E u8i E u8j E vi8 E vj8

=E[u81 ]

Since, by [17], E[u81 ] = O(n−4 ) and we have assumed that supn,k |xk | < ∞, u1 v1 x1 + · · · +
a.s.
un vn xn −
−→ 0.
To prove (b), we employ a different strategy. In the setting where (u1 , . . . , un ) is the first row
of a Haar-distributed orthogonal matrix, the result follows from the application of a well-known
concentration of measure result [28, Th. 2.3 and Prop. 1.8] which states that there are positive
constants C, c such that for n large enough, for any 1-Lipschitz function fn on the unit sphere
of Rn , for all ε > 0,
P fn (u1 , . . . , un ) − E fn (u1 , . . . , un )

ε

Ce−cnε .
2

This implies that if E[fn (u1 , . . . , un )] converges, as n → ∞, to a finite limit, then fn (u1 , . . . , un )
converges almost surely to the same limit. In the complex setting, we note that a uniformly
distributed random vector on the unity sphere of Cn is a uniformly distributed random vector on
the unit sphere of R2n so that we have proved the results in the unitary setting as well. ✷
Proposition A.3. Let, for each n, u(n) = (u1 , . . . , un ), v (n) = (v1 , . . . , vn ) be the two first columns
of a uniform random orthogonal (resp. unitary) matrix. Let also λ(n) = (λ1 , . . . , λn ) be a random
family of real numbers2 independent of (u(n) , v (n) ) such that almost surely, supn,k |λk | < ∞. We
suppose that there exists a deterministic probability measure μ on R such that almost surely, as
n → 0, n1 nk=1 δλk converges weakly to μ.
2 As in Lemma A.2, we have suppressed the index n for notational brevity.

Then as n → ∞,

are tight. Moreover, we have
n

|μU (n) ,V (n) | =

|uk vk |δλk ,
k=1

thus, by the Cauchy–Schwartz inequality, |μU (n) ,V (n) |(R) 1. The set of continuous functions
on the real line tending to zero at infinity admits a countable dense subset, so it suffices to prove
that for any fixed such function f , the convergences of (25) and (26) hold almost surely when
applied to f . This follows easily from Lemma A.2. ✷
