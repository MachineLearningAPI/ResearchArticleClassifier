Abstract
We show that Derksen–Weyman–Zelevinsky’s mutations of quivers with potential yield equivalences of
suitable 3-Calabi–Yau triangulated categories. Our approach is related to that of Iyama–Reiten and ‘Koszul
dual’ to that of Kontsevich–Soibelman. It improves on previous work by Vitória. In Appendix A, the firstnamed author studies pseudo-compact derived categories of certain pseudo-compact dg algebras.

1. Introduction
1.1. Previous work and context
A quiver is an oriented graph. Quiver mutation is an elementary operation on quivers. In mathematics, it first appeared in the definition of cluster algebras invented by Fomin and Zelevinsky
at the beginning of this decade [16] (though, with hindsight, Gabrielov transformations [19,13]
may be seen as predecessors). In physics, it appeared a few years before in Seiberg duality [47].
In this article, we ‘categorify’ quiver mutation by interpreting it in terms of equivalences between
derived categories. Our approach is based on Ginzburg’s Calabi–Yau algebras [21] and on mutation of quivers with potential. Let us point out that mutation of quivers with potential goes back
to the insight of mathematical physicists, cf. for example Section 5.2 of [14], Section 2.3 of [6],
Section 6 of [15] and Section 3 of [35]. Their methods were made rigorous by Derksen, Weyman
and Zelevinsky [12]. The idea of interpreting quiver mutation via derived categories goes back at
least to Berenstein and Douglas [7] and was further developed by Mukhopadhyay and Ray [39] in
physics and by Bridgeland [10], Iyama and Reiten [25], Vitória [53], Kontsevich and Soibelman
[36], etc. in mathematics. The main new ingredient in our approach is Ginzburg’s algebra [21]
associated to a quiver with potential. This differential graded (= dg) algebra is concentrated in
negative degrees. Several previous approaches have only used its homology in degree 0, namely
the Jacobian algebra of [12] or vacualgebra of the physics literature. By taking into account the
full dg algebra, we are able to get rid of the restrictive hypotheses that one had to impose and to
prove the homological interpretation in full generality.
Our second source of inspiration and motivation is the theory which links cluster algebras [16]
to representations of quivers and finite-dimensional algebras, cf. [28] and [27] for recent surveys.
This theory is based on the discovery [38] of the striking similarity between the combinatorics of
cluster algebras and those of tilting theory in the representation theory of finite-dimensional algebras. The cluster category, invented in [4], and the module category over the preprojective algebra
[20] provided a conceptual framework for this remarkable phenomenon. These categories are triangulated respectively exact and 2-Calabi–Yau. Recall that a (triangulated or exact) category is
d-Calabi–Yau if there are non-degenerate bifunctorial pairings
Exti (X, Y ) × Extd−i (Y, X) → k,

where k is the ground field. Iyama and Reiten [25] used both 2- and 3-Calabi–Yau categories
to categorify mutations of different classes of quivers. We first learned about the possibility of
categorifying arbitrary quiver mutations using 3-Calabi–Yau categories from Kontsevich, who
constructed the corresponding categories using A∞ -structures, cf. Section 5 of [32] for a sketch.
This idea is fully developed in Section 8 of Kontsevich and Soibelman’s work [36]. The Ginzburg
dg algebras which we use are Koszul dual to Kontsevich–Soibelman’s A∞ -algebras. Since a
Ginzburg dg algebra is concentrated in negative degrees, its derived category has a canonical tstructure given by the standard truncation functors. The heart is equivalent to the module category
over the zeroth homology of the Ginzburg algebra, i.e. over the Jacobian algebra. This allows us

2120

B. Keller, D. Yang / Advances in Mathematics 226 (2011) 2118–2168

to establish the link to previous approaches, especially to the one based on the cluster category
and the one based on decorated representations [38,12,11].
1.2. The classical paradigm and the main result
Like Derksen, Weyman and Zelevinsky [12], we model our approach on the reflection functors
introduced by Bernstein, Gelfand and Ponomarev [8]. Let us recall their result in a modern form
similar to the one we will obtain: Let Q be a finite quiver and i a source of Q, i.e. a vertex
without incoming arrows. Let Q be the quiver obtained from Q by reversing all the arrows
going out from i. Let k be a field, kQ the path algebra of Q (we multiply paths in the same way
as we compose morphisms so that for paths p : u → v and q : v → w, the product, denoted by
qp, goes from u to w) and D(kQ) the derived category of the category of all right kQ-modules.
For a vertex j of Q respectively Q, let Pj respectively Pj be the projective indecomposable
associated with the vertex j (i.e. the right ideal generated by the idempotent ej of the respective
path algebra). Then the main result of [8] reformulated in terms of derived categories following
Happel [22] says that there is a canonical triangle equivalence
F : D kQ → D(kQ)
which takes Pj to Pj for j = i and Pi to the cone over the morphism
Pi →

Pj

whose components are the left multiplications by all arrows going out from i. In Theorem 3.2,
we will obtain an analogous result for the mutation of a quiver with potential (Q, W ) at an arbitrary vertex i, where the rôle of the quiver with reversed arrows is played by the quiver with
potential (Q , W ) obtained from (Q, W ) by mutation at i in the sense of Derksen, Weyman and
Zelevinsky [12]. The rôle of the derived category D(kQ) will be played by the derived category D(Γ ) of the complete differential graded algebra Γ = Γ (Q, W ) associated with (Q, W )
by Ginzburg [21]. Let us point out that our result is analogous to but not a generalization of
Bernstein, Gelfand and Ponomarev’s since even if the potential W vanishes, the derived category
D(Γ ) is not equivalent to D(kQ). Notice that we work with completed path algebras because
this is the setup in which Derksen–Weyman–Zelevinsky’s results are proved. Nevertheless, with
suitable precautions, one can prove similar derived equivalences for non-complete Ginzburg algebras, cf. Section 7.6 of [29].
1.3. Plan of the paper and further results
In Section 2, we first recall Derksen–Weyman–Zelevinsky’s results on mutations of quivers
with potential. In Section 2.6, we recall the definition of the Ginzburg dg algebra associated to a
quiver with potential and show that reductions of quivers with potential yield quasi-isomorphisms
between Ginzburg dg algebras. Then we recall the basics on derived categories of differential
graded algebras in Sections 2.12 and 2.14. In Section 2.18, we prove the useful Theorem 2.19,
which could be viewed as an ‘Artin–Rees lemma’ for derived categories of suitable complete
dg algebras. In Section 3, we state and prove the main result described above. In Section 4, we
establish a link with cluster categories in the sense of Amiot [1], who considered the Jacobi-finite
case, and Plamondon [43,42], who is considering the general case. We use this to give another

2121

proof of the fact that neighboring Jacobian algebras are nearly Morita equivalent in the sense
of Ringel [46]. This was previously proved in [3] and [11]. We include another proof to illustrate the links between our approach and those of these two papers. In Section 5, we compare
the canonical t-structures in the derived categories associated with a quiver with potential and
its mutation at a vertex. In general, the hearts of these t-structures are not related by a tilt in
the sense of Happel, Reiten and Smalø [23]. However, this is the case if the homology of the
Ginzburg dg algebra is concentrated in degree 0. In Section 6, we show that this last condition is preserved under mutation. In a certain sense, this explains the beautiful results of Iyama
and Reiten [25] on mutation of 3-Calabi–Yau algebras (concentrated in degree 0): In fact, these
algebras are quasi-isomorphic to the Ginzburg algebras associated to the corresponding quivers with potential. Strictly speaking, the classical derived category, which we use in the main
body of the paper, is not well-adapted to topological dg algebras like the completed Ginzburg
dg algebra. In Appendix A, the first-named author defines the pseudo-compact derived category,
which is the ‘sophisticated’ derived category associated with a topological dg algebra (satisfying suitable boundedness and regularity hypotheses). He shows that the main result also holds
for pseudocompact derived categories. In more detail, in Appendix A, he first recalls the basics
of the theory of pseudocompact algebras from [18]. As shown in Corollary A.8, the theory immediately yields a positive answer to question 12.1 of [12], where the authors asked whether a
Jacobian algebra is determined by its category of finite-dimensional modules. In Section A.11,
the theory of pseudocompact algebras and modules is then adapted, under certain boundedness
and regularity assumptions, to pseudocompact differential graded algebras. The analogue of the
main theorem also holds in this setting (Section A.22). Moreover, the results of Amiot [1] on
Jacobi-finite quivers with potentials can be extended to potentials in complete path algebras as
we see in Section A.20.
2. Preliminaries
2.1. Quivers with potential
We follow [12]. Let k be a field. Let Q be a finite quiver (possibly with loops and 2-cycles).
We denote its set of vertices by Q0 and its set of arrows by Q1 . For an arrow a of Q, let s(a)
denote its source and t (a) denote its target. The lazy path corresponding to a vertex i will be
denoted by ei .
The complete path algebra kQ is the completion of the path algebra kQ with respect to the
ideal generated by the arrows of Q. Let m be the ideal of kQ generated by the arrows of Q.
A potential on Q is an element of the closure Pot(kQ) of the space generated by all non-trivial
cyclic paths of Q. We say two potentials are cyclically equivalent if their difference is in the
closure of the space generated by all differences a1 . . . as − a2 . . . as a1 , where a1 . . . as is a cycle.
For a path p of Q, we define ∂p : Pot(kQ) → kQ as the unique continuous linear map which
takes a cycle c to the sum c=upv vu taken over all decompositions of the cycle c (where u and
v are possibly lazy paths). Obviously two cyclically equivalent potentials have the same image
under ∂p . If p = a is an arrow of Q, we call ∂a the cyclic derivative with respect to a.
Remark 2.2. The space of cyclic equivalence classes of elements in Pot(kQ) identifies with the
reduced continuous Hochschild homology H H0red (kQ), the quotient of kQ by the closure of the
subspace generated by the lazy paths and the commutators of elements of kQ.

Let W be a potential on Q such that W is in m2 and no two cyclically equivalent cyclic
paths appear in the decomposition of W [12, (4.2)]. Then the pair (Q, W ) is called a quiver with
potential. Two quivers with potential (Q, W ) and (Q , W ) are right-equivalent if Q and Q have
the same set of vertices and there exists an algebra isomorphism ϕ : kQ → kQ whose restriction
on vertices is the identity map and ϕ(W ) and W are cyclically equivalent. Such an isomorphism
ϕ is called a right-equivalence.
The Jacobian algebra of a quiver with potential (Q, W ), denoted by J (Q, W ), is the quotient
of the complete path algebra kQ by the closure of the ideal generated by ∂a W , where a runs
over all arrows of Q. It is clear that two right-equivalent quivers with potential have isomorphic
Jacobian algebras. A quiver with potential is called trivial if its potential is a linear combination
of cycles of length 2 and its Jacobian algebra is the product of copies of the base field k. A quiver
with potential is called reduced if ∂a W is contained in m2 for all arrows a of Q.
Let (Q , W ) and (Q , W ) be two quivers with potential such that Q and Q have the
same set of vertices. Their direct sum, denoted by (Q , W ) ⊕ (Q , W ), is the new quiver with
potential (Q, W ), where Q is the quiver whose vertex set is the same as the vertex set of Q
(and Q ) and whose arrow set the union of the arrow set of Q and the arrow set of Q , and
W =W +W .
Theorem 2.3. In the following statements, all quivers are quivers without loops.
(a) (See [12, Proposition 4.4].) A quiver with potential is trivial if and only if it is rightequivalent, via a right-equivalence which takes arrows to linear combinations of arrows,
to a quiver with potential (Q, W ) such that Q1 consists of 2n distinct arrows
Q1 = {a1 , b1 , . . . , an , bn },
where each ai bi is a 2-cycle, and
n

W=

ai bi .
i=1

(b) (See [12, Proposition 4.5].) Let (Q , W ) be a quiver with potential and (Q , W ) be a
trivial quiver with potential. Let (Q, W ) be their direct sum. Then the canonical embedding
kQ → kQ induces an isomorphism of Jacobian algebras J (Q , W ) → J (Q, W ).
(c) (See [12, Theorem 4.6].) For any quiver with potential (Q, W ), there exist a trivial quiver
with potential (Qtri , Wtri ) and a reduced quiver with potential (Qred , Wred ) such that
(Q, W ) is right-equivalent to the direct sum (Qtri , Wtri ) ⊕ (Qred , Wred ). Furthermore, the
right-equivalence class of each of (Qtri , Wtri ) and (Qred , Wred ) is determined by the rightequivalence class of (Q, W ). We call (Qtri , Wtri ) and (Qred , Wred ) respectively the trivial
part and the reduced part of (Q, W ).
2.4. Mutations of quivers with potential
We follow [12]. Let (Q, W ) be a quiver with potential. Let i be a vertex of Q. Assume the
following conditions:

B. Keller, D. Yang / Advances in Mathematics 226 (2011) 2118–2168

2123

(c1) the quiver Q has no loops;
(c2) the quiver Q does not have 2-cycles at i;
(c3) no cyclic path occurring in the expansion of W starts and ends at i [12, (5.2)].
Note that under the condition (c1), any potential is cyclically equivalent to a potential satisfying (c3). We define a new quiver with potential μ˜ i (Q, W ) = (Q , W ) as follows. The new
quiver Q is obtained from Q by
Step 1 For each arrow β with target i and each arrow α with source i, add a new arrow [αβ]
from the source of β to the target of α.
Step 2 Replace each arrow α with source or target i with an arrow α in the opposite direction.
The new potential W is the sum of two potentials W1 and W2 . The potential W1 is obtained from
W by replacing each composition αβ by [αβ], where β is an arrow with target i. The potential
W2 is given by
W2 =

[αβ]β α ,
α,β

where the sum ranges over all pairs of arrows α and β such that β ends at i and α starts at i.
It is easy to see that μ˜ i (Q, W ) satisfies (c1)–(c3). We define μi (Q, W ) as the reduced part of
μ˜ i (Q, W ), and call μi the mutation at the vertex i.
Theorem 2.5.
(a) (See [12, Theorem 5.2].) The right-equivalence class of μ˜ i (Q, W ) is determined by the rightequivalence class of (Q, W ).
(b) (See [12].) The quiver with potential μ˜ 2i (Q, W ) is right-equivalent to the direct sum of
(Q, W ) with a trivial quiver with potential.
(c) (See [12, Theorem 5.7].) The correspondence μi acts as an involution on the rightequivalence classes of reduced quivers with potential satisfying (c1) and (c2).
2.6. The complete Ginzburg dg algebra
Let (Q, W ) be a quiver with potential. The complete Ginzburg dg algebra Γˆ (Q, W ) is con˜ be the graded quiver with the same vertices as Q and whose
structed as follows [21]: Let Q
arrows are
• the arrows of Q (they all have degree 0),
• an arrow a ∗ : j → i of degree −1 for each arrow a : i → j of Q,
• a loop ti : i → i of degree −2 for each vertex i of Q.
The underlying graded algebra of Γˆ (Q, W ) is the completion of the graded path algebra k Q˜ in
˜ Thus,
the category of graded vector spaces with respect to the ideal generated by the arrows of Q.
ˆ
the n-th component of Γ (Q, W ) consists of elements of the form p λp p, where p runs over all

2124

B. Keller, D. Yang / Advances in Mathematics 226 (2011) 2118–2168

paths of degree n. The differential of Γˆ (Q, W ) is the unique continuous linear endomorphism
homogeneous of degree 1 which satisfies the Leibniz rule
d(uv) = (du)v + (−1)p u dv,
˜
for all homogeneous u of degree p and all v, and takes the following values on the arrows of Q:
• da = 0 for each arrow a of Q,
• d(a ∗ ) = ∂a W for each arrow a of Q,
• d(ti ) = ei ( a [a, a ∗ ])ei for each vertex i of Q, where ei is the lazy path at i and the sum
runs over the set of arrows of Q.
Remark 2.7. The authors thank N. Broomhead for pointing out that Ginzburg’s original definition in Section 5.3 of [21] concerns the case where the potential W lies in the non-completed path
algebra kQ and that he completes with respect to the ideal generated by the cyclic derivatives of
W rather than the ideal generated by the arrows of Q.
The following lemma is an easy consequence of the definition.
Lemma 2.8. Let (Q, W ) be a quiver with potential. Then the Jacobian algebra J (Q, W ) is the
0-th cohomology of the complete Ginzburg dg algebra Γˆ (Q, W ), i.e.
J (Q, W ) = H 0 Γˆ (Q, W ).
Let (Q, W ) and (Q , W ) be two quivers with potential. Let Γ = Γˆ (Q, W ) and Γ =
Γˆ (Q , W ) be the associated complete Ginzburg dg algebras.
Lemma 2.9. Assume (Q, W ) and (Q , W ) are right-equivalent. Then the complete Ginzburg dg
algebras Γ and Γ are isomorphic to each other.
Proof. Let ϕ be a right-equivalence from (Q, W ) to (Q , W ). Let ϕ∗ : Γ → Γ be the unique
continuous algebra homomorphism such that its restriction to Q0 is the identity and for ρ ∈ Q1
and i ∈ Q0
ϕ∗ (ρ) = ϕ(ρ),
ϕ∗ ρ ∗ =

2125

It is straightforward to prove that ϕ∗ commutes with the differentials. Thus ϕ∗ is a homomor˜ 1 (the k-vector space with
phism of dg algebras. Moreover, ϕ∗ induces a linear map from k Q
˜ to k Q˜ 1 , whose matrix is invertible. Indeed, this matrix is quasi-diagonal
basis the arrows of Q)
with diagonal blocks the matrix of the linear map from kQ1 to kQ1 induced from ϕ, the matrix
(bρ,ρ )ρ∈Q1 ,ρ ∈Q (which we read from the definition of ϕ∗ (ρ ∗ )), and the identity matrix of size
1
the cardinality of Q0 (which we read from the definition of ϕ(ti )), all the three of which are
invertible. Therefore ϕ∗ defined as above is an isomorphism of dg algebras from Γ to Γ . ✷
Lemma 2.10. Suppose that (Q, W ) is the direct sum of (Q , W ) and (Q , W ) and that
(Q , W ) is trivial. Then the canonical projection Γ → Γ induces quasi-isomorphisms
Γ /mn → Γ /m n
for all n

1 and a quasi-isomorphism Γ → Γ .

Proof. Let K be the kernel of the projection from Γ onto Γ . For i 1, let Ki ⊂ K be mi ∩ K.
Thus, Ki is the topological span of the paths of length i with at least one arrow in Q or Q ∗ .
Then the Ki form a decreasing filtration of K and the complex Ki /Ki+1 is isomorphic to
(U ⊕ V )⊗R i /U ⊗R i ,
where R = i∈Q0 k, V = kQ1 ⊕ kQ1 ∗ as a complex endowed with the differential given by W
(thus, V is contractible) and U = kQ1 ⊕ kQ1∗ ⊕ k{ti | i ∈ Q0 } as a complex with the differential
which is zero on k{ti | i ∈ Q0 } and, on kQ1 ⊕ kQ1∗ , is given by the projection of W onto the
subspace of cycles of length 2. Thus Ki /Ki+1 is contractible. It follows that K/Kn is contractible
for each n 1, which implies the first assertion. The second one now follows from the Mittag–
Leffler Lemma A.4. ✷
Remark 2.11. As a consequence of Lemma 2.10, the canonical projection kQ → kQ induces
an isomorphism of Jacobian algebras J (Q, W ) → J (Q , W ), which is the inverse of the isomorphism in Theorem 2.3(b).
2.12. Derived categories
We follow [30]. Let A be a dg k-algebra with differential dA (all differentials are of degree 1).
A (right) dg module M over A is a graded A-module equipped with a differential dM such that
dM (ma) = dM (m)a + (−1)|m| m dA (a)
where m in M is homogeneous of degree |m|, and a ∈ A.
Given two dg A-modules M and N , we define the morphism complex to be the graded kvector space HomA (M, N ) whose i-th component HomiA (M, N ) is the subspace of the product
j
j +i ) consisting of morphisms f such that
j ∈Z Homk (M , N
f (ma) = f (m)a,

2126

B. Keller, D. Yang / Advances in Mathematics 226 (2011) 2118–2168

for all m in M and all a in A, together with the differential d given by
d(f ) = f ◦ dM − (−1)|f | dN ◦ f
for a homogeneous morphism f of degree |f |.
The category C(A) of dg A-modules is the category whose objects are the dg A-modules,
and whose morphisms are the 0-cycles of the morphism complexes. This is an abelian category
and a Frobenius category for the conflations which are split exact as sequences of graded Amodules. Its stable category H(A) is called the homotopy category of dg A-modules, which is
equivalently defined as the category whose objects are the dg A-modules and whose morphism
spaces are the 0-th homology groups of the morphism complexes. The homotopy category H(A)
is a triangulated category whose suspension functor Σ is the shift of dg modules M → M[1].
The derived category D(A) of dg A-modules is the localization of H(A) at the full subcategory
of acyclic dg A-modules. A short exact sequence
0→M →N →L→0
in C(A) yields a triangle
M → N → L → ΣM
in D(A). A dg A-module P is cofibrant if
s∗

HomC (A) (P , L) −
→ HomC (A) (P , M)

is surjective for each quasi-isomorphism s : L → M which is surjective in each component. We
use the term “cofibrant” since these are actually the objects which are cofibrant for a certain
structure of Quillen model category on the category C(A), cf. [31, Theorem 3.2].
Proposition 2.13. A dg A-module is cofibrant if and only if it is a direct summand of a dg module
P which admits a filtration
· · · ⊂ Fp−1 ⊂ Fp ⊂ · · · ⊂ P ,

p∈Z

in C(A) such that
(F1) we have Fp = 0 for all p 0, and P is the union of the Fp , p ∈ Z;
(F2) the inclusion morphism Fp−1 ⊂ Fp splits in the category of graded A-modules, for all
p ∈ Z;
(F3) the subquotient Fp /Fp−1 is isomorphic in C(A) to a direct summand of a direct sum of
shifted copies of A, for all p ∈ Z.
Let P be a cofibrant dg A-module. Then the canonical map
HomH(A) (P , N ) → HomD(A) (P , N )

B. Keller, D. Yang / Advances in Mathematics 226 (2011) 2118–2168

2127

is bijective for all dg A-modules N . The canonical projection from H(A) to D(A) admits a
left adjoint functor p which sends a dg A-module M to a cofibrant dg A-module pM quasiisomorphic to M. We call pM the cofibrant resolution of M. In other words, we have
HomD(A) (M, N ) = HomH(A) (pM, N ) = H 0 HomA (pM, N ) .

The perfect derived category per(A) is the smallest full subcategory of D(A) containing A which
is stable under taking shifts, extensions and direct summands. An object M of D(A) belongs to
per(A) if and only if it is compact, i.e. the functor HomD(A) (M, ?) commutes with arbitrary
(set-indexed) direct sums, cf. Section 5 of [30] and [41]. The finite-dimensional derived category
Dfd (A) is the full subcategory of D(A) consisting of those dg A-modules whose homology is of
finite total dimension, or equivalently those dg A-modules M such that the sum of the dimensions
of the spaces
HomD(A) P , Σ p M ,

p ∈ Z,

is finite for any P in per(A).
2.14. Cofibrant resolutions of simples over a tensor algebra
Let Q be a finite graded quiver, and kQ the complete path algebra. Thus, the ith component
of the graded algebra kQ is the completion of the space of paths of total degree i with respect to
the descending filtration by path length. Let m be the two-sided ideal of kQ generated by arrows
of Q. Let A = (kQ, d) be a topological dg algebra whose differential takes each arrow of Q to
an element of m.
For a vertex i of Q, let Pi = ei A, and let Si be the simple module corresponding to i. Then in
C(A) we have a short exact sequence
π
→
Si → 0,
0 → ker(π) → Pi −

where π is the canonical projection from Pi to Si . Explicitly, we have
ρPs(ρ) =

ker(π) =
ρ∈Q1 : t (ρ)=i

ρPs(ρ)
ρ∈Q1 : t (ρ)=i

with the induced differential. Notice that the direct sum decomposition only holds in the category
of graded A-modules and that, if d(ρ) does not vanish, the summand ρPs(ρ) is not stable under
the differential of ker(π). The simple module Si is quasi-isomorphic to
P = Cone ker(π) → Pi ,
whose underlying graded space is
ΣρPs(ρ) ⊕ Pi .
ρ∈Q1 : t (ρ)=i

Let n be the maximum of the degrees of the arrows ending in i. Let
Fp = 0 for p < −n,

F−n = Pi ,

2128

B. Keller, D. Yang / Advances in Mathematics 226 (2011) 2118–2168

and for p > −n, let
Fp =

ΣρPs(ρ) ⊕ Pi ,
ρ

where the sum is taken over the arrows ρ of Q ending in i and of degree at least 1 − p. Then each
Fp , p ∈ Z, is a dg A-submodule of P . It is easy to check that (F1), (F2) and (F3) hold. Therefore,
P is a cofibrant dg A-module, and hence it is a cofibrant resolution of Si . In particular, Si belongs
to the perfect derived category per(A).
Lemma 2.15. Let i and j be two vertices of Q, and let n be an integer. Let aijn denote the number
of arrows of Q starting from j and ending at i and of degree −n + 1. Then the dimension over k
of HomD(A) (Si , Σ n Sj ) equals aijn + 1 if i = j and n = 0, and equals aijn otherwise.
Proof. First one notices that the morphism complex HomA (Pi , Sj ) is 1-dimensional and concentrated in degree 0 if i = j and vanishes otherwise. Now let P be the cofibrant resolution of Si
constructed as above. By the assumption on the differential of A, the differential of HomA (P , Sj )
vanishes. Therefore, we have
HomD(A) Si , Σ n Sj = HomH(A) P , Σ n Sj = H n HomA (P , Sj ) = HomnA (P , Sj ),

which has a basis
πρ ρ ∈ Q1 , s(ρ) = j, t (ρ) = i, |ρ| = −n + 1 ∪ {πi }
if i = j and n = 0, and
πρ ρ ∈ Q1 , s(ρ) = j, t (ρ) = i, |ρ| = −n + 1
otherwise, where πi is the projection from Pi to Si , and for an arrow ρ of Q starting from j ,
πρ is the projection from ΣρPj ∼
= Σ n Pj to Sj . The assertion follows immediately. ✷
2.16. The perfect derived category is Krull–Schmidt
As in Section 2.14, let Q be a finite graded quiver, kQ the complete path algebra, m the twosided ideal of kQ generated by the arrows of Q and A = (kQ, d) a topological dg algebra whose
differential takes each arrow of Q to an element of m.
Lemma 2.17. The perfect derived category per(A) is Krull–Schmidt, i.e. any object in per(Γ ) is
isomorphic to a finite direct sum of objects whose endomorphism rings are local.
Proof. Clearly the category of finitely generated projective graded A-modules is Krull–Schmidt
and its radical is the ideal generated by the morphisms A[i] → A[i], i ∈ Z, given by the left
multiplication by an element of the ideal m. Moreover, in this category, each endomorphism f
of an object P admits a ‘Fitting–Jordan decomposition’, which can be constructed as follows:
Let i > 0. Then the morphism fi induced by f in P /P mi admits a Fitting–Jordan decomposition
into the direct sum of Ii = Im fimi and Ki = Ker fimi for some integer mi . Clearly, by induction,
we can even construct an increasing sequence of integers mi , i > 0, with this property. Then we

B. Keller, D. Yang / Advances in Mathematics 226 (2011) 2118–2168

2129

have natural projection morphisms Ki+1 → Ki and Ii+1 → Ii and clearly P decomposes into
the direct sum of the inverse limits K∞ and I∞ and f acts nilpotently in each finite-dimensional
quotient of K∞ and invertibly in I∞ . Thus, the morphism induced by f in K∞ belongs to
the radical and the morphism induced in I∞ is invertible. Now we consider the category of
strictly perfect dg A-modules, i.e. the full subcategory of the category of dg A-modules obtained
as the closure of A under shifts, direct factors and extensions which split in the category of
graded A-modules (equivalently: cones). If P belongs to this category, its underlying graded
A-module is finitely generated projective. It follows that P decomposes into a finite sum of
indecomposable dg A-modules. Now assume that P is indecomposable as a dg A-module and
that f an endomorphism of P in the category of dg A-modules. If we apply the Fitting–Jordan
decomposition to the morphism of graded modules underlying f , we find a decomposition of
P as the direct sum of K∞ and I∞ and the construction shows that these are dg submodules
of P , that f acts by a radical morphism in K∞ and by an invertible morphism in I∞ . Since P
is indecomposable, f is radical or invertible. We conclude that the category of strictly perfect dg
A-modules is a Krull–Schmidt category. It follows that the canonical functor from the category
of strictly perfect dg A-modules to the perfect derived category is essentially surjective and that
the perfect derived category is a Krull–Schmidt category since it is the quotient of the category
of strictly perfect dg A-modules by the ideal of morphisms factoring through contractible strictly
perfect dg A-modules. ✷
2.18. On finite-dimensional dg modules
As in Section 2.14, let Q be a finite graded quiver, kQ the complete path algebra, m the twosided ideal of kQ generated by the arrows of Q and A = (kQ, d) a topological dg algebra whose
differential takes each arrow of Q to an element of m. Let Hfd (A) be the full subcategory of H(A)
formed by the dg modules of finite total dimension and let Acfd (A) be its full subcategory formed
by the acyclic dg modules of finite total dimension. Let D0 (A) be the localizing subcategory of
D(A) generated by Dfd (A). Thus, the subcategory D0 (A) is the closure of Dfd (A) under arbitrary
coproducts and finite extensions.
Theorem 2.19. Assume that all arrows of Q are of degree

0.

(a) The objects of Dfd (A) are compact in D(A) and the canonical functor
Hfd (A)/Acfd (A) → Dfd (A)
is an equivalence.
(b) For each perfect dg module P and each dg module M belonging to D0 (A), the canonical
map
L

colim(DA) P ⊗A A/mn , M → (DA)(P , M)

is bijective.

2130

B. Keller, D. Yang / Advances in Mathematics 226 (2011) 2118–2168

Proof. (a) Let us first show that both categories, Dfd (A) and Hfd (A)/Acfd (A) are generated by
the simple modules Si . Indeed, if M is a dg module, then, since A is concentrated in negative
degrees, we have an exact sequence of dg modules
0→τ

0M

→ M → τ>0 (M) → 0.

If M belongs to Hfd (A)/Acfd (A) respectively Dfd (A), this sequence yields a triangle in the
respective triangulated category. Thus, it is enough to check that an object M whose only nonzero component is in degree 0 belongs to the triangulated category generated by the Si . This is
easy by induction on the length of the zeroth component as a module over the semilocal algebra
H 0 (A). Since the Si are compact, it follows that Dfd (A) consists of compact objects. Moreover,
in order to show the equivalence claimed in (a), it is enough to show that the canonical functor is
fully faithful. For this, it suffices to show that the canonical map
Hfd (A)/Acfd (A) (Si , M) → (Dfd A)(Si , M)
is bijective for each vertex i of Q and for each dg module M of finite total dimension. Let us first
show that it is surjective. Let Pi → Si be the canonical projection and R its kernel. Let j be the
inclusion of R in Pi . By Section 2.14, the cone C over j is a cofibrant resolution of Si . Since M
is of finite total dimension, it is annihilated by some power mn of the ideal m. Let f : Si → M be
a morphism of Dfd (A). It is represented by a morphism of dg modules g : C → M. Since C is the
cone over j , the datum of g is equivalent to that of a morphism of dg modules g0 : Pi → M and
a morphism of graded modules g1 : R → M homogeneous of degree −1 and such that g0 ◦ j =
d(g1 ). Since M is annihilated by mn , the morphism g0 factors canonically through the projection
Pi → Pi /Pi mn+1 and the morphism g1 through the projection R → R/Rmn . We choose these
exponents because we have
Pi mn+1 ∩ R = Rmn .
Indeed, the graded module Pi mn+1 has a topological basis consisting of the paths of length
n + 1 ending in i, the graded module R has a topological basis consisting of the paths of
length 1 ending in i and so Rmn also has as topological basis the set of paths of length n + 1
ending in i. It follows that we have an exact sequence of dg modules
0 → R/Rmn → Pi /Pi mn+1 → Si → 0
and the cone C over the map
R/Rmn → Pi /Pi mn+1
is still quasi-isomorphic to Si . By construction, the map g : C → M factors through the canonical
projection C → C and C is of finite total dimension. So the given morphism f is represented
by the fraction
Si ← C → M

B. Keller, D. Yang / Advances in Mathematics 226 (2011) 2118–2168

2131

and hence is the image of a morphism of Hfd (A)/Acfd (A). To show injectivity of the canonical
map, we first observe that the functor
Hfd (A)/Acfd (A) → Dfd (A)
detects isomorphisms. Indeed, if a morphism f : L → M becomes invertible after applying this
functor, then its cone is acyclic and so f was already invertible. Now we show that the map
Hfd (A)/Acfd (A) (Si , M) → (Dfd A)(Si , M)
is injective. Indeed, if f is a morphism in its kernel, then in the triangle
f

ε
Σ −1 Y −
→
Si −
→ M → Y,

the morphism ε admits a section s in Dfd (A). This section lifts to a morphism s˜ by the surjectivity
we have already shown. Then ε s˜ is invertible since it becomes invertible in Dfd (A) and so ε is a
retraction and f vanishes.
(b) Both sides are homological functors in M which commute with arbitrary coproducts. So it
is enough to show the claim for M in Dfd (A). By (a), we may assume that M belongs to Hfd (A).
We may also assume that P is strictly perfect. Let us show that the map is surjective. A morphism
from P to M in D(A) is represented by a morphism of dg modules f : P → M. Since M is of
finite total dimension, it is annihilated by some power mn and so f factors through the projection
P → P /P mn , which shows that f is in the image of the map. Let us now show injectivity. Let
f : P /P mn → M be a morphism of DA such that the composition
P → P /P mn → M
vanishes in DA. By the calculus of left fractions, there is a quasi-isomorphism M → M such
that the morphism f is represented by a fraction
f

P /P mn −→ M ← M,
where f is a morphism in Hfd (A). By forming the shifted cone over f we obtain an exact
sequence of dg modules
0 → Σ −1 M → E → P /P mn → 0
which splits as a sequence of graded A-modules and whose terms all have finite total dimension. Since the composition P → P /P mn → M vanishes in DA, the canonical surjection
P → P /P mn factors through E in the category of dg modules:
P → E → P /P mn .
Since E is of finite total dimension, the map P → E factors through the canonical projection
P → P /P mN for some N
0. The composition
P /P mN → E → P /P mn

2132

B. Keller, D. Yang / Advances in Mathematics 226 (2011) 2118–2168

is the canonical projection since its composition with P → P /P mN is the canonical projection
P → P /P mn and P → P /P mn is surjective. The composition
P /P mN → E → P /P mn → M
vanishes in Dfd (A) since it contains two successive morphisms of a triangle. Thus the composition of the given map f : P /P mn → M with the projection P /P mN → P /P mn vanishes in
Dfd (A), which implies that the given map vanishes in the passage to the colimit. ✷
2.20. The Nakayama functor
We keep the notations and assumptions of Section 2.18. We will construct a fully faithful
functor from per(A) to D0 (A). Let P be in per(A). Then the functor
D HomD(A) (P , ?) : D0 (A)op → Mod k
is cohomological and takes coproducts of D0 (A) to products because P is compact. Now the
triangulated category D0 (A) is compactly generated by Dfd (A). So by the Brown representability
theorem, we have an object νP in D0 (A) and a canonical isomorphism
D HomD(A) (P , L) = HomD(A) (L, νP )
functorial in the object L of D0 (A). As in the case of the Serre functor (cf. [9,52]), one shows
that the assignment P → νP underlies a canonical triangle functor from per(A) to D0 (A). We
call it the Nakayama functor. It takes a strictly perfect object P to the colimit colim D(P /P mn ).
Proposition 2.21.
(a) The Nakayama functor ν : per(A) → D0 (A) is fully faithful. Its image is formed by the objects M such that for each object F in Dfd (A), the sum
dim Hom F, Σ i M
i∈Z

is finite.
(b) The functor
Φ : per(A) → Mod Dfd (A)op
taking an object P to the restriction of Hom(P , ?) to Dfd (A) is fully faithful.
Proof. (a) If P and Q are perfect objects, we have
L

Hom(νP , νQ) = D Hom(Q, νP ) = D colim Hom Q ⊗A A/mn , νP ,

where we have used part (b) of Theorem 2.19. Now by definition of νP , we have
L

L

D colim Hom Q ⊗A A/mn , νP = D colim D Hom P , Q ⊗A A/mn

B. Keller, D. Yang / Advances in Mathematics 226 (2011) 2118–2168

2133

and the last space identifies with
L

L

lim DD Hom P , Q ⊗A A/mn = lim Hom P , Q ⊗A A/mn = Hom(P , Q).
Thus, the functor ν is fully faithful.
(b) The given functor takes its values in the full subcategory U of left modules on Dfd (A)
which take values in the category of finite-dimensional vector spaces. The duality functor
D : U → Mod(Dfd (A)) is fully faithful and the composition D ◦ Φ is isomorphic to the composition of the Yoneda embedding with ν. By part (a), the composition D ◦ Φ and therefore Φ
are fully faithful. ✷
3. The derived equivalence
3.1. The main theorem
Let (Q, W ) be a quiver with potential and i a fixed vertex of Q. We assume (c1), (c2) and (c3)
as in Section 2.4. Write μ˜ i (Q, W ) = (Q , W ). Let Γ = Γˆ (Q, W ) and Γ = Γˆ (Q , W ) be the
complete Ginzburg dg algebras associated to (Q, W ) and (Q , W ) respectively, cf. Section 2.6.
For a vertex j of Q, let Pj = ej Γ and Pj = ej Γ .
Theorem 3.2.
(a) There is a triangle equivalence
F :D Γ

→ D(Γ ),

which sends the Pj to Pj for j = i and to the cone Ti over the morphism
Pi →

Pt (α)

(1)

α

for i = j , where we have a summand Pt (α) for each arrow α of Q with source i and the
corresponding component of the map is the left multiplication by α. The functor F restricts
to triangle equivalences from per(Γ ) to per(Γ ) and from Dfd (Γ ) to Dfd (Γ ).
(b) Let Γred respectively Γred be the complete Ginzburg dg algebra associated with the reduction
of (Q, W ) respectively the reduction μi (Q, W ) of μ˜ i (Q, W ). The functor F yields a triangle
equivalence
Fred : D Γred → D(Γred ),
which restricts to triangle equivalences from per(Γred ) to per(Γred ) and from Dfd (Γred ) to
Dfd (Γred ).
Proof. (a) We will prove this in the following two subsections: we will first construct a Γ –Γ bimodule T , and then we will show that the left derived tensor functor and the right derived Hom
functor associated to T are quasi-inverse equivalences.

2134

B. Keller, D. Yang / Advances in Mathematics 226 (2011) 2118–2168

(b) This follows from (a) and Lemma 2.10, since quasi-isomorphisms of dg algebras induce
triangle equivalences in their derived categories. ✷
Remark 3.3. In the situation of the theorem, there is also a triangle equivalence F : D(Γ ) →
D(Γ ) which, for j = i, sends the Pj to Pj and, for i = j , to the shifted cone
Ti = Σ −1

Ps(β) → Pi ,

(2)

β

where we have a summand Ps(β) for each arrow β of Q with target i and the corresponding
component of the morphism is left multiplication by β. To construct F , one can either adapt the
proof below or put
F = tSi ◦ F
where tSi is the twist functor [48] with respect to the 3-spherical object Si , which gives rise to a
triangle
RHom(Si , X) ⊗ Si → X → tSi (X) → Σ RHom(Si , X) ⊗ Si

for each object X of D(Γ ).
3.4. A dg Γ –Γ -bimodule
First let us analyze the definition of Ti . For an arrow α of Q starting at i, let Pα be a copy of
Pt (α) . We denote the element et (α) of this copy by eα . Let PΣi be a copy of ΣPi . We denote the
element ei of this copy by eΣi . Let Ti be the mapping cone of the canonical inclusion
ι
→
Pi −

Pα ,
α∈Q1 : s(α)=i

a→

eα αa.
α∈Q1 : s(α)=i

Therefore, as a graded space, Ti has the decomposition
Ti = PΣi ⊕

Pα ,
α∈Q1 : s(α)=i

and the differential is given by
eα aα = −eΣi dΓ (ai ) +

dTi eΣi ai +
α∈Q1 : s(α)=i

Note that each Pα is a dg submodule of Ti .

eα dΓ (aα ) + αai .
α∈Q1 : s(α)=i

In this and the next subsection, Tj will be Pj for a vertex j of Q different from i. Let T be
the direct sum of the Tj , where j runs over all vertices of Q, i.e.
T=

Tj .
j ∈Q0

In the following, for each arrow ρ of Q˜ , we will construct a morphism fρ in Λ = HomΓ (T , T )
and show that the assignment ρ → fρ extends to a morphism of dg algebras from Γ to Λ.
For a vertex j of Q, let fj : Tj → Tj be the identity map.
For an arrow α of Q starting at i, we define the morphism fα : Tt (α) → Ti of degree 0 as the
composition of the isomorphism Tt (α) ∼
= Pα with the canonical embedding Pα → Ti , i.e.
fα : Tt (α) → Ti ,

a → eα a,

and define the morphism fα ∗ : Ti → Tt (α) of degree −1 by
fα

eΣi ai +

αρ ∗ aρ .

eρ aρ = −αti ai −
ρ∈Q1 : s(ρ)=i

ρ∈Q1 : s(ρ)=i

For an arrow β of Q ending at i, we define the morphism fβ : Ti → Ts(β) of degree 0 by
fβ

eρ aρ = −β ∗ ai −

eΣi ai +
ρ∈Q1 : s(ρ)=i

(∂ρβ W )aρ ,
ρ∈Q1 : s(ρ)=i

and define the morphism fβ ∗ : Ts(β) → Ti of degree −1 as the composition of the morphism
Ts(β) → PΣi , a → eΣi βa and the canonical embedding PΣi → Ti , i.e.
fβ ∗ : Ts(β) → Ti ,

a → eΣi βa.

For a pair of arrows α, β of Q such that α starts at i and β ends at i, we define
f[αβ] : Ts(β) → Tt (α) ,

a → αβa,

and
f[αβ]∗ = 0 : Tt (α) → Ts(β) .
For an arrow γ of Q not incident to i, we denote by fγ and fγ ∗ respectively the leftmultiplication by γ from Ts(γ ) to Tt (γ ) and the left-multiplication by γ ∗ from Tt (γ ) to Ts(γ ) ,
i.e.
fγ : Ts(γ ) → Tt (γ ) ,

a → γ a,

fγ ∗ : Tt (γ ) → Ts(γ ) ,

a → γ ∗ a.

2136

B. Keller, D. Yang / Advances in Mathematics 226 (2011) 2118–2168

For a vertex j of Q different from i, we define ftj as the left-multiplication by tj from Tj to
itself, i.e.
f tj : T j → T j ,

a → tj a.

It is a morphism of degree −2. We define fti as the Γ -linear morphism of degree −2 from Ti to
itself given by
ρ ∗ aρ .

eρ aρ = −eΣi ti ai +

fti eΣi ai +
ρ∈Q1 : s(ρ)=i

ρ∈Q1 : s(ρ)=i

We extend all the morphisms defined above trivially to morphisms from T to itself.
Proposition 3.5. The correspondence taking ej to fj for all vertices j of Q and taking an arrow
ρ of Q˜ to fρ extends to a homomorphism of dg algebras from Γ to Λ = HomΓ (T , T ). In this
way, T becomes a left dg Γ -module.
Proof. Recall that Λ = HomΓ (T , T ) is the dg endomorphism algebra of the dg Γ -module T .
The m-adic topology of Γ induces an m-adic topology of Λ: If we let
n = f ∈ Λ im(f ) ∈ T m ,
then the powers of n form a basis of open neighborhoods of 0. The topological algebra Λ is
complete with respect to this topology. Note that the image fa of the arrow a does not lie in
n but that the composition of the images of any two arrows of Q˜ does lie in n. Thus the correspondence defined in the proposition uniquely extends to a continuous algebra homomorphism.
We denote by fp the image of an element p in Γ . It remains to check that this map commutes
with the differentials on generators ρ of Γ . Namely, we need to show
dΛ (fρ ) = 0 for each arrow ρ of Q ,
dΛ (fρ ∗ ) = f∂ρ W
dΛ (ftj ) = fj

for each arrow ρ of Q ,
[fρ , fρ ∗ ] fj

for each vertex j of Q .

ρ ∈Q1

We will prove the first two equalities in the following Lemmas 3.6–3.9 and the last equality in
Lemma 3.10. ✷

Proof. It suffices to check the equalities on the generator et (α) of Tt (α) and on the generators eΣi

dΛ (f[αβ] )(es(β) ) = dTt (α) f[αβ] (es(β) ) − (−1)0 f[αβ] dTs(β) (es(β) )
= dTt (α) (αβ)
= 0.
Since f[αβ]∗ is the zero morphism, its differential dΛ (f[αβ]∗ ) is zero as well. On the other
hand,
f∂[αβ] W (et (α) ) = f∂[αβ] W

1 +β

= f∂[αβ] W1 (et (α) ) + fβ

Here we applied the following observation: Let p be a path of Q neither starting or ending at i
and let [p] be the path of Q obtained from p by replacing all ab by [ab], where a, b are a pair
of arrows of Q such that a starts at i and b ends at i. Then the map f[p] is the left multiplication
by p. Therefore
f∂[αβ] W = 0 = dΛ (f[αβ]∗ ).

✷

Lemma 3.9. Let γ be an arrow of Q not starting or ending at i. Then
dΛ (fγ ) = 0,

dΛ (fγ ∗ ) = f∂γ W .

Proof. The first equality follows from
dΛ (fγ )(es(γ ) ) = dTt (γ ) fγ (es(γ ) ) − (−1)0 fγ dTs(γ ) (es(γ ) )
= dTt (γ ) (γ )
= 0.
For the second, we have
dΛ (fγ ∗ )(et (γ ) ) = dTs(γ ) fγ ∗ (et (γ ) ) − (−1)−1 fγ ∗ dTt (γ ) (et (γ ) )
= dTs(γ ) γ ∗
= ∂γ W,

2140

B. Keller, D. Yang / Advances in Mathematics 226 (2011) 2118–2168

f∂γ W (et (γ ) ) = f∂γ W1 (et (γ ) )
= f[∂γ W ] (et (γ ) )
= ∂γ W.
Therefore dΛ (fγ ∗ ) = f∂γ W .

3.11. Proof of the equivalence
In the preceding subsection we constructed a dg Γ –Γ -bimodule T . Clearly T is cofibrant as
L

a right dg Γ -module. Consequently we obtain a pair of adjoint triangle functors F =? ⊗Γ T and
G = HomΓ (T , ?) between the derived categories D(Γ ) and D(Γ ). In this subsection we will
prove that they are quasi-inverse equivalences.

2142

We will denote by Sj and Sj respectively the simple modules over Γ and Γ attached to
the vertex j of Q. As shown in the proof of Theorem 2.19(a), they respectively generate the
triangulated categories Dfd (Γ ) and Dfd (Γ ).
Lemma 3.12.
(a) Let j be a vertex of Q. If j = i, we have an isomorphism in D(Γ )
F Si ∼
= ΣSi .
If j = i, then F Sj is isomorphic in D(Γ ) to the cone of the canonical map
Σ −1 Sj → HomD(Γ ) Σ −1 Sj , Si ⊗k Si .
(b) For any vertex j of Q, we have an isomorphism in D(Γ )
GF Sj ∼

Proof. As shown in Section 2.14, a cofibrant resolution of Sj is given by the graded vector space

We will simplify the description of F Sj by showing that the kernel ker(f ) of f : M → Tj is
contractible and computing its cokernel. Then we will apply the functor G to the cokernel. We
distinguish two cases: j = i and j = i.
Case j = i. Let us compute the effect of f on the generators of the three families of summands
of M. Recall that Ti is generated by eΣi and eα , α : i → t (α) in Q, and Tj , j = i, is generated
by ej .
(1) The morphism fti : Σ 2 Ti → Ti sends eΣi to −eΣi ti , and eα (α : i → t (α) in Q) to −eΣi α ∗ .
(2) For ρ : i → t (ρ): in this case ρ = b for some b : s(b) → i in Q. The morphism
b → T sends eb
fb ∗ : ΣTs(b)
i
s(b) to eΣi b.
(3) For τ : s(τ ) → i: in this case τ = a for some a : i → t (a) in Q. The morphism
fa : Tta(a) → Ti sends eta(a) to ea .
This description shows that the morphism f is injective. Moreover, the image im(f ) is the
dg Γ -module generated by eΣi ti , eΣi α ∗ , eΣi b, and eα (where α : i → t (α) and b : s(b) → i are
arrows in Q). Thus the cokernel of f is ΣSi . So
F Si ∼
= ΣSi ,
and
GF Si ∼
= G(ΣSi ) = HomΓ (T , ΣSi ) = HomΓ (PΣi , ΣSi ) = Si .
Case j = i.
(1) The morphism ftj : Σ 2 Tj → Tj sends ej to tj .
(2) For ρ : j → t (ρ), we have ρ = γ for some γ : j → t (γ ) = i in Q, or ρ = [ab] for some
a : i → t (a) and b : j → i in Q, or ρ = a for some a : i → j in Q. In the first case, the morphism
γ
γ
fγ ∗ : ΣTt (γ ) → Tj sends et (γ ) to γ ∗ . In the second case, the morphism f[ab]∗ : ΣTt[ab]
(ab) → Ti is

a to −at .
zero. In the third case, the morphism fa ∗ : ΣTia → Ti sends eαa to −aα ∗ and sends eΣi
i
(3) For τ : s(τ ) → j , we have τ = γ for some γ : i = s(γ ) → j in Q, or τ = [ab] for some
a : i → j and b : s(b) → i in Q, or τ = b for some b : j → i in Q. In the first case, the morphism
γ
γ
[ab]
fγ : Ts(γ ) → Tj sends es(γ ) to γ . In the second case, the morphism f[ab] : Ts(ab)
→ Tj sends

2144

B. Keller, D. Yang / Advances in Mathematics 226 (2011) 2118–2168

[ab]
b
es(ab)
to ab. In the third case, the morphism fb : Tib → Tj sends eαb to −∂αb W and sends eΣi
to −b∗ .
By (2), the kernel ker(f ) of f contains all ΣTt[ab]
(ab) . For a pair of arrows a : i → t (a) and
b : j → i in Q, let Ra,b denote the graded Γ -submodule of M generated by

ra,b =

γ

es(γ ) ∂abγ W

γ

[a b ]
, es(a
b ) ∂aba b W

a ,b

, eab

where γ runs over all γ : i = s(γ ) → j in Q and a and b run over all a : i → j and b : s(b ) → i
in Q. The degree of ra,b is zero, so Ra,b is indeed a dg Γ -submodule of M. It is contained in
ker(f ) since
[a b ]

f[a b ] es(a

f (ra,b ) =

fγ es(γ ) ∂abγ W +
γ

=

a ,b

γ ∂abγ W +
γ

a b ∂aba b W − ∂ab W

= 0.
Moreover, it is straightforward to show that the sum of all Ra,b is a direct sum and that the
underlying graded space of ker(f ) is
ΣTt[ab]
(ab) ⊕
a,b

Ra,b ,
a,b

where τ runs over all arrows τ : s(τ ) → j of Q . If τ = γ for some γ : i = s(γ ) → j in Q, then

If τ = [a b ] for some a : i → j and b : s(b ) → i in Q, then

If τ = b for some b : j → i in Q, then
f∂[ab]b

et[ab]
(ab) = δb,b ea .

Summing them up, we see that the differential of ker(f ) sends et[ab]
(ab) to ra,b , and this induces an
isomorphism of degree 1 from ΣTt[ab]
(ab) to Ra,b . In particular, ker(f ) is contractible.
Now im(f ) is generated by tj , γ ∗ (γ : j → t (γ ) = i), aα ∗ (a : i → j and α : i → t (α) in
Q), ati (a : i → j in Q), γ (γ : i = s(γ ) → j in Q), and ab (a : i → j and b : s(b) → i in Q),

b∗ (b : j → i in Q). Therefore cok(f ) is the vector space k{e¯j , a¯ | a : i → j in Q} concentrated
in degree 0 with the obvious Γ -action. Thus we have that
F Sj ∼
= cok(f )
is the universal extension of Sj by Si , or in other words, it is isomorphic to the cone of the
canonical map
Σ −1 Sj → HomD(Γ ) Σ −1 Sj , Si ⊗k Si .
Further,
GF Sj ∼
= G cok(f )
= HomΓ T , cok(f ) ,
and so the complex underlying GF Sj is
d
→
k{ha | a : i → j in Q} → 0,
0 → k{gj , ga | a : i → j in Q} −

where gj : Pj → cok(f ) is the canonical projection, ga : Pa → cok(f ) is a copy of gj , and
ha : ΣPi → cok(f ) is of degree 1 sending eΣi to a.
¯ The differential d sends ga to ha . Thus
the above dg Γ -module is quasi-isomorphic to k{gj } concentrated in degree 0. From the left
Γ -action on T we deduce that gj ej = gj . Therefore GF(Sj ) is isomorphic to Sj . ✷
Proposition 3.13. The functors F and G induce a pair of quasi-inverse triangle equivalences
Dfd (Γ )

G

Dfd Γ .

F

Proof. Let η : Id → GF be the unit of the adjoint pair (F, G). Let j be a vertex of Q. We would
like to show that
ηSj : Sj → GF Sj
is invertible. Under the adjunction
∼

HomDfd (Γ ) F Sj , F Sj −
→ HomDfd (Γ ) Sj , GF Sj ,

the morphism ηSj corresponds to the identity of F Sj . So ηSj is non-zero. Since Sj is isomorphic to GF Sj (Lemma 3.12), and HomDfd (Γ ) (Sj , Sj ) is one-dimensional, it follows that ηSj is
invertible. Therefore, so are its shifts ηΣ p Sj = Σ p ηSj (p ∈ Z). Let
f

be a triangle in Dfd (Γ ). Then we obtain a commutative diagram

Thus if ηX1 and ηX2 are isomorphisms, then so is ηX . Since Dfd (Γ ) is generated by all the Sj ’s,
we deduce that for all objects X of Dfd (Γ ), the morphism ηX is an isomorphism. It follows that
F is fully faithful. Moreover, by Lemma 3.12(a), the objects F Sj , j ∈ Q0 , generate the triangulated category Dfd (Γ ), since they generate all the simples Sj . Therefore F is an equivalence,
and it follows that G is an equivalence as well. ✷
Proof of Theorem 3.2. As in Section 2.18, let D0 (Γ ) denote the localizing subcategory of
D(Γ ) generated by Dfd (Γ ). Now observe that the functors F and G commute with arbitrary coproducts. Since they induce equivalences between Dfd (Γ ) and Dfd (Γ ) and these subcategories
are formed by compact objects, the functors F and G also induce equivalences between D0 (Γ )
and D0 (Γ ). Now let us check that F is compatible with the Nakayama functor ν defined in
Section 2.20. For P in per(Γ ) and M in D0 (Γ ), the object FP is perfect in D(Γ ) and we have
Hom M, νFP = D Hom FP , M = D Hom P , GM = Hom GM, νP .

Since F and G are quasi-inverse to each other on the subcategories D0 , we also have
Hom GM, νP

= Hom M, F νP .

We obtain that when restricted to per(Γ ), the functors F ν and νF are isomorphic. Since F ν is
fully faithful on per(Γ ) and ν is fully faithful on per(Γ ), it follows that F is fully faithful on
per(Γ ). Since F Γ = T generates per(Γ ) it follows that F induces an equivalence from per(Γ )
to per(Γ ). Since F commutes with arbitrary coproducts, F itself is an equivalence. ✷
4. Nearly Morita equivalence for neighboring Jacobian algebras
Let (Q, W ) be a quiver with potential, and Γ the associated complete Ginzburg dg algebra.
For a vertex j of Q, let Pj = ej Γ and let Sj be the corresponding simple dg Γ -module concentrated in degree 0.
Recall that the finite-dimensional derived category Dfd (Γ ) is generated by the Sj ’s and all of
them belong to the perfect derived category per(Γ ) (cf. Sections 2.14 and 2.18). It follows that
Dfd (Γ ) is a triangulated subcategory of per(Γ ). We call the idempotent completion CQ,W of the
triangle quotient category
per(Γ )/Dfd (Γ )

the generalized cluster category associated with (Q, W ). This category was introduced by
C. Amiot in the case when the Jacobian algebra J (Q, W ) = H 0 Γ is finite-dimensional, cf. [1].
Let π denote the projection functor from per(Γ ) to CQ,W .

B. Keller, D. Yang / Advances in Mathematics 226 (2011) 2118–2168

2147

Remark 4.1. For a compactly generated triangulated category T , let us denote by T c the subcategory of compact objects, i.e. the objects C such that the functor Hom(C, ?) commutes with
arbitrary coproducts, cf. [41]. Recall that D0 (Γ ) denotes the localizing subcategory of D(Γ )
generated by Dfd (Γ ). We have (DΓ )c = per(Γ ) and (D0 Γ )c = Dfd (Γ ). Thus, by a theorem of
Neeman [40], we have an equivalence
∼
CQ,W −
→
D(Γ )/D0 (Γ ) .
c

This shows that the quotient D(Γ )/D0 (Γ ) is the ‘unbounded version’ of the cluster category.
Let fpr(Γ ) be the full subcategory of CQ,W consisting of cones of morphisms of add(π(Γ )).
If the Jacobian algebra is finite-dimensional, this subcategory equals CQ,W , cf. Proposition 2.9
and Lemma 2.10 of [1]. The following proposition generalizes [1, Proposition 2.9].
Proposition 4.2. (See [43].) Let F be the full subcategory of per(Γ ) consisting of cones of
morphisms of add(Γ ). Then the projection functor π : per(Γ ) → CQ,W induces a k-linear equivalence between F and fpr(Γ ).
As immediate consequences of Proposition 4.2, we have
HomCQ,W (Γ, Γ ) = Homper(Γ ) (Γ, Γ ) = J (Q, W ),

and
HomCQ,W (Γ, ΣΓ ) = Homper(Γ ) (Γ, ΣΓ ) = 0.

Proposition 4.3. The functor HomCQ,W (Γ, ?) induces an equivalence from the additive quotient
category fpr(Γ )/(ΣΓ ) to the category mod J (Q, W ) of finitely presented modules over the Jacobian algebra J (Q, W ).
Proof. As in [33, Proposition 2.1(c)], cf. also [5, Theorem 2.2].

✷

We denote the functor HomCQ,W (Γ, ?) by Ψ and also use this symbol for the induced equivalence as in the preceding proposition.
Lemma 4.4. (See [43].) Short exact sequences in mod J (Q, W ) lift to triangles in fpr(Γ ). More
precisely, given a short exact sequence in mod J (Q, W ), we can find a triangle in CQ,W whose
terms are in fpr(Γ ) and whose image under the functor Ψ is isomorphic to the given short exact
sequence.
Assume that Q does not have loops. Let j be any vertex of Q. In this section (in contrast to
Section 3), we denote by Tj the mapping cone of the morphism of dg modules
(ρ)

Pj −−→

Pt (ρ) ,
ρ

2148

B. Keller, D. Yang / Advances in Mathematics 226 (2011) 2118–2168

where we have a summand Pt (ρ) for each arrow ρ of Q with source j , and the corresponding
component of the morphism is the left multiplication by ρ. We denote by Rj the mapping cone
of the morphism of dg modules
(τ )

Ps(τ ) −−→ Pj ,
τ

where we have a summand Ps(τ ) for each arrow τ of Q with target j , and the corresponding
component of the morphism is the left multiplication by τ . From ΣTj to Rj there is a morphism
of dg modules, which we will denote by ϕj , given in matrix form as
ϕj =

−τ ∗
tj

−∂ρτ W
ρ∗

: ΣTj → Rj .

The mapping cone of ϕj is isomorphic as a dg Γ -module to the standard cofibrant resolution of
Sj given in Section 2.14. Thus ΣTj and Rj are isomorphic in CQ,W . In particular, ΣTj belongs
to fpr(Γ ). Direct calculation shows that the J (Q, W )-module Ψ (Rj ) and hence Ψ (ΣTj ) are
isomorphic to the simple module Sj .
From now on, we fix a vertex i which does not lie on a 2-cycle. Let (Q , W ) = μ˜ i (Q, W ),
let Γ be the associated complete Ginzburg dg algebra, and let Pj = ej Γ for each vertex j
and let Sj be the corresponding simple dg Γ -module concentrated in degree 0. It follows from
Theorem 3.2 that we have a triangle equivalence
F¯ : C(Q ,W ) → CQ,W ,
which sends Pj to Pj for j = i, and Pi to Ti .
Proposition 4.5. (See [43].) The equivalence F¯ : C(Q ,W ) → CQ,W restricts to an equivalence
from fpr(Γ ) to fpr(Γ ).
Corollary 4.6. There is a canonical equivalence of categories of finitely presented modules
mod J Q , W / Si → mod J (Q, W )/(Si ),

which restricts to an equivalence between the subcategories of finite-dimensional modules.
Remark 4.7. The restriction of the equivalence in Corollary 4.6 to the subcategories of finitedimensional modules is a nearly Morita equivalence in the sense of Ringel [46]. It was first shown
in [3, Theorem 7.1] that the two Jacobian algebras J (Q, W ) and J (Q , W ) are nearly Morita
equivalent in the sense of Ringel. Another proof was given in [11, Proposition 6.1].
Proof. For each vertex j of Q , we define dg Γ -modules Tj and Rj analogously to the dg
Γ -modules Tj and Rj . Explicitly, Ri is the mapping cone of the morphism of dg modules
(α )

Pt (α) −−→ Pi ,
α

B. Keller, D. Yang / Advances in Mathematics 226 (2011) 2118–2168

2149

where α runs over all arrows of Q with source i. The dg functor underlying F takes this morphism of dg modules to the morphism
(f )

Pt (α) −−α−→ Ti ,
α

where fα was defined in Section 3.4. In fact, it is exactly the inclusion of the summand Pt (α)
corresponding to the arrow α into Ti . We immediately deduce that the mapping cone of this
latter morphism is quasi-isomorphic to ΣPi . So the functor F takes Ri to ΣPi . Thus we have
isomorphisms in CQ,W
Σ F¯ Ti ∼
= F¯ Ri ∼
= ΣPi .
By Proposition 4.5, the equivalence F¯ induces an equivalence
fpr Γ / ΣΓ ⊕ ΣTi → fpr(Γ )/(ΣΓ ⊕ ΣTi ).

Thus, we have the following square
fpr Γ / ΣΓ ⊕ ΣTi

mod J Q , W

/ Si

Φ

fpr(Γ )/(ΣΓ ⊕ ΣTi )

mod J (Q, W ) /(Si ).

The induced functor Φ from mod(J (Q , W ))/(Si ) to mod(J (Q, W ))/(Si ), represented by the
dashed arrow, is an equivalence as well. Explicitly, for a finitely presented module M over
J (Q, W ), the module Φ(M) is defined as Ψ ◦ F¯ (X), where X is an object of fpr(Γ ) such
that Ψ (X) ∼
= M.
It remains to prove that the functor Φ and its quasi-inverse Φ −1 take finite-dimensional
modules to finite-dimensional modules. We will prove the assertion for Φ by induction on the
dimension of the module: it is similar for Φ −1 .
Let j be a vertex of Q. We have seen that the simple J (Q , W )-module Sj is the image of
ΣTj under the functor Ψ . First of all, we have
Φ Si = Ψ ◦ F¯ ΣTi = Ψ (ΣPi ) = 0.
In the following we assume that j is different from i. We have a triangle in C(Q ,W ) :
(ρ)

Ps(ρ) −−→ Pj → ΣTj → Σ

Ps(ρ) ,
ρ

where ρ ranges over all arrows of Q with target j . We apply the functor F¯ and obtain a triangle

The image of the first map is the J (Q, W )-submodule of H 0 Pj generated by ρ, αb, and ∂aβ W ,
where ρ, α, β, a and b are arrows of Q such that s(ρ) = i, t (ρ) = t (α) = s(β) = j , s(α) =
t (b) = s(a) = t (β) = i. It has finite codimension in H 0 Pj . Therefore, the module Φ(Sj ) is
finite-dimensional.
Now let M be a finite-dimensional J (Q , W )-module. Suppose
0→L→M →N →0
is a short exact sequence in mod J (Q , W ) such that L and N are non-trivial. Following
Lemma 4.4, we have a triangle in fpr(Γ ):
X → Y → Z → ΣX,
whose image under the functor Ψ is isomorphic to the above short exact sequence. We apply the
functor F¯ to this triangle and obtain a triangle in fpr(Γ ):
F¯ X → F¯ Y → F¯ Z → Σ F¯ X.
Applying Ψ to this triangle, we obtain an exact sequence in mod J (Q, W ):
Φ(L) → Φ(M) → Φ(N ).
By induction hypothesis, both Φ(L) and Φ(N) are finite-dimensional, and hence so is Φ(M).
This completes the proof. ✷
5. Tilting between Jacobian algebras
5.1. The canonical t-structure
Let A be a dg k-algebra such that the homology H p (A) vanishes for all p > 0. Let D 0 be the
full subcategory of the derived category D(A) whose objects are the dg modules M such that the
homology H p (M) vanishes for all p > 0. The following lemma already appears in Section 2.1
of [1]. For the convenience of the reader, we include a detailed proof (slightly different from the
one in [1]).

Lemma 5.2.
(a) The subcategory D 0 is a left aisle [34] in the derived category D(A).
(b) The functor M → H 0 (M) induces an equivalence from the heart of the corresponding tstructure to the category Mod H 0 (A) of all right H 0 (A)-modules.
Proof. (a) Clearly, the subcategory D 0 is stable under the suspension functor Σ and under
extensions. We have to show that for each object M of D(A), there is a triangle
M → M → M → ΣM
such that M belongs to D 0 and M is right orthogonal to D 0 . The map of complexes τ 0 A →
A is a quasi-isomorphism of dg algebras. Thus we may assume that the components Ap vanish
for all p > 0. If M is a dg module, the subcomplex τ 0 M of M is then a dg submodule and thus
the sequence
0→τ

0M

→ M → τ>0 M → 0

is an exact sequence of dg modules. Of course, the two truncation functors preserve quasiisomorphisms and thus induce functors from D(A) to itself so that the above sequence yields
a triangle functorial in the object M of D(A). In this triangle, the object τ 0 M lies in of course
in D 0 . Let us show that τ>0 M lies in the right orthogonal subcategory of D 0 . Indeed, if L
lies in D 0 and we have a morphism f : L → τ>0 M, then, by the functoriality of the triangle,
f factors through τ>0 L, which vanishes.
(b) As in the proof of (a), we may assume that the components Ap vanish for p > 0. We then
have the morphism of dg algebras A → H 0 (A). The restriction along this morphism yields a
functor from Mod H 0 (A) to the heart H of the t-structure. Using the truncation functors defined
in (a), we see that this functor is essentially surjective. Let us show that it is fully faithful. Let L
and M in be in Mod H 0 (A). We compute morphisms between their images in D(A). We have
D(A) (L, M) = colim H(A) L, M
where M ranges through the category of quasi-isomorphisms with source M in H(A). Now for
each object M → M in this category, we have the object M → M → τ 0 M . This shows that
the objects M with M n = 0 for n < 0 form a cofinal subcategory. We restrict the colimit to this
cofinal subcategory. We find
colim H(A) L, M

= colim H(A) L, τ

0M

∼

colim H(A) L, H 0 M

Thus the functor Mod H 0 (A) → D(A) is fully faithful.

5.3. Comparison of t-structures
Assume that (Q, W ) and (Q , W ) are two quivers with potential related by the mutation at a
vertex i. Let Γ and Γ be the corresponding complete Ginzburg algebras and
F :D Γ

→ D(Γ )

2152

the associated triangle equivalence taking Pj = ej Γ to Pj for j = i and Pi to the cone over the
morphism
Pi →

Pt (α)
α: s(α)=i

whose components are the left multiplications by the corresponding arrows α. The image under
F of the canonical t-structure on D(Γ ) (cf. Section 5.1) is a new t-structure on D(Γ ). Let
us denote its left aisle by D 0 and its right aisle by D>0 . Let us denote the left aisle of the
canonical t-structure on D(Γ ) by D 0 and let A be its heart. By Lemma 5.2(b), the category
A is equivalent to the category Mod(J (Q, W )) of all right modules over the Jacobian algebra of
(Q, W ).
The following lemma shows how the new t-structure is obtained from the old one and that the
two hearts are ‘piecewise equivalent’. However, in general, the new heart is not tilted from the
old one in the sense of [23], cf. also [10], because these hearts are not faithful in general (i.e. the
higher extension groups computed in the hearts are different from the higher extension groups
computed in the ambient triangulated categories). They are, however, faithful if the homology of
Γ is concentrated in degree 0 and then the homology of Γ is also concentrated in degree 0, as
we show below in Theorem 6.2.
Lemma 5.4.
(a) We have ΣD 0 ⊂ D 0 ⊂ D 0 .
(b) Let F ⊂ A be the subcategory of modules M supported at i and T ⊂ A the left orthogonal
subcategory of F . Then an object X of D(Γ ) belongs to D 0 (respectively D>0 ) iff H n (X)
vanishes in all degrees n > 0 and H 0 (X) lies in T (respectively H n (X) vanishes in all
degrees n < 0 and H 0 (X) lies in F ).
(c) The pair (F , T ) is a torsion pair, i.e. F is the right orthogonal of T and T the left orthogonal
of F .
Proof. An object X of D(Γ ) belongs to D 0 iff it satisfies Hom(FPj , Σ n X) = 0 for all n > 0
and all 1 j n. Using this characterization, parts (a) and (b) are easy to check. Also part (c) is
easy to check using that D 0 and D>0 are the two aisles of a t-structure. ✷
Corollary 5.5. Let A be the heart of the t-structure (D 0 , D 0 ). Then an object X of D(Γ )
belongs to A if and only if H n (X) = 0 for n = 0, −1, H 0 (X) belongs to T and H −1 (X) belongs
to F .
6. Stability under mutation of Ginzburg algebras concentrated in degree 0
6.1. The statement
Let k be a field. Let Q be a non-empty finite quiver and W a potential in kQ. The quiver
Q may contain loops and 2-cycles but we assume that W is reduced (i.e. no paths of length 1
occur in the relations deduced from W ). Let Γ be the complete Ginzburg algebra associated with
(Q, W ) and put A = H 0 (Γ ).

B. Keller, D. Yang / Advances in Mathematics 226 (2011) 2118–2168

2153

For each vertex i of Q, we denote by Si the associated simple module and by Pi = ei A its
projective cover. Fix a vertex i of Q and consider the complex T which is the sum of the Pj ,
j = i, concentrated in degree 0 and of the complex
f

→B →0
0 → Pi −
where Pi is in degree −1, B is the sum over the arrows α starting in i of the Pt (α) and the
components of f are the left multiplications by the corresponding arrows.
Theorem 6.2. Suppose that the complete Ginzburg algebra Γ = Γˆ (Q, W ) has its homology
concentrated in degree 0. If the simple module Si corresponding to the vertex i is spherical
(i.e. there are no loops at i in Q), then T is a tilting object in the perfect derived category
per(A). Thus, under the assumptions (c1), (c2) and (c3), the complete Ginzburg algebra Γ
associated with the mutated quiver with potential μi (Q, W ) still has its homology concentrated
in degree 0 and the Jacobian algebras A and A associated with (Q, W ) and μi (Q, W ) are
derived equivalent.
Using the theorem and Corollary 5.5 we obtain the following corollary.
Corollary 6.3. Under the hypothesis of the theorem, the category Mod J (μi (Q, W )) is obtained
by tilting, in the sense of [23,10], from the category Mod J (Q, W ) at the simple module Si .
Let us prove the theorem.
Proof of Theorem 6.2. We would like to use Proposition 6.5 below and have to check conditions (1), (2) and (3). Condition (1) holds since B belongs to B, the additive closure of the Pj ,
j = i. Condition (2) holds since f : Pi → B is a left B-approximation. Finally, in order to show
condition (3), it suffices to show that f is injective. This can be deduced from Ginzburg’s results
[21] but we can also show it as follows: Since the homology of Γ is concentrated in degree 0,
L

the functor ? ⊗Γ A is an equivalence from per(Γ ) to per(A) whose inverse is given by the reL

striction along the projection morphism Γ → H 0 Γ = A. If we apply the equivalence ? ⊗Γ A
to the cofibrant resolution pSi constructed in Section 2.14, we obtain the complex of projective
A-modules
f

0 → Pi −
→ B → B → Pi → 0,
as we see by using the explicit description of pSi given at the beginning of the proof of
Lemma 3.12. The image of this complex under the restriction along Γ → A is again quasiisomorphic to Si . So the complex itself is quasi-isomorphic to Si . In particular, the map f is
injective. ✷
6.4. Tilts of tilting objects in triangulated categories
The following lemma is well-known to the experts in tilting theory although it is not easy to
point to a specific reference. One could cite Auslander, Platzeck and Reiten [2], Riedtmann and

Leclerc and Schröer [20] and many others.
Let T be a triangulated category with suspension functor Σ . Let T be a tilting object in T ,
i.e.
(a) T coincides with the closure of T under taking suspensions, desuspensions, extensions and
direct factors and
(b) we have T (T , Σ n T ) = 0 for all integers n = 0.
Assume that we are given a decomposition
T = T0 ⊕ T1 .

Let add(T1 ) denote the closure of T1 under taking finite direct sums and direct summands. Assume that there exists a map f : T0 → B such that
(1) B belongs to add(T1 );
(2) the map f ∗ : T (B, T1 ) → T (T0 , T1 ) is surjective and
(3) the map f∗ : T (T1 , T0 ) → T (T1 , B) is injective.

Proposition 6.5. The object T = T0∗ ⊕ T1 is a tilting object in T .
Proof. It is clear from the triangle (3) that T still generates T in the sense of condition (a). It
remains to be checked that there are no morphisms between non-trivial shifts of the two given
summands of T . We distinguish several cases:
Case 1: We have T (T0∗ , ΣT0∗ ) = 0. Consider the triangles

following diagram whose first two rows and last column are exact (we write (X, Y ) instead of
T (X, Y )):

This implies that the space of morphisms (T0∗ , ΣT0∗ ) is isomorphic to the space of maps up to
homotopy from the complex T0 → B, with T0 in degree 0, to its shift by one degree to the left.
Clearly conditions (1) and (2) suffice for this space to vanish.

This shows that the space of morphisms (T0∗ , Σ −1 T0∗ ) is isomorphic to the space of maps up to

Clearly conditions (2) and (3) suffice to imply the vanishing of this space.
Case 3: We have T (T0∗ , Σ n T0∗ ) = 0 for all integers n different from −1, 0 and 1. This follows
easily by considering the long exact sequences associated with the triangle (3).
Case 4: We have T (T0∗ , Σ n T1 ) = 0 for all integers n different from 0 and 1. Again this is easy.

Appendix A. Pseudocompact dg algebras and derived categories by Bernhard Keller
A.1. Motivation
As pointed out by D. Simson [49], the Jacobian algebra of a quiver with potential is a topological algebra in a natural way and it is natural and useful to take this structure into account and
to consider (suitable) topological modules (or dually, to consider coalgebras and comodules, cf.
for example [50]). It is then necessary to consider derived categories of topological modules as
well. This allows one, for example, to extend the results of Amiot [1] from potentials belonging
to kQ to potentials belonging to the completion kQ. We briefly recall some classical facts on the
relevant class of topological algebras and modules: the pseudocompact ones. We show their usefulness in reconstructing Jacobian algebras from their categories of finite-dimensional modules.
Then we adapt the notion of pseudocompact module to the dg setting and show that mutation
also yields equivalences between pseudocompact derived categories. Notice that the definition
of the pseudocompact derived category which we give after Lemma A.13 may seem ‘too simple’ because it uses the notion of ordinary quasi-isomorphism instead of a more refined notion
of weak equivalence as in [37,44,51]. The category we obtain is nevertheless equivalent to the
‘sophisticated one’ because of the boundedness and smoothness hypothesis which we impose.
A.2. Reminder on pseudocompact algebras and modules
Let k be a field and R a finite-dimensional separable k-algebra (i.e. R is projective as a bimodule over itself). By an R-algebra, we mean an algebra in the monoidal category of R-bimodules.
Following Chapter IV, Section 3 of [18], we call an R-algebra A pseudocompact if it is endowed
with a linear topology for which it is complete and separated and admits a basis of neighborhoods of zero formed by left ideals I such that A/I is finite-dimensional over k. Let us fix a
pseudocompact R-algebra A. A right A-module M is pseudocompact if it is endowed with a
linear topology admitting a basis of neighborhoods of zero formed by submodules N of M such

B. Keller, D. Yang / Advances in Mathematics 226 (2011) 2118–2168

2157

that M/N is finite-dimensional over k. A morphism between pseudocompact modules is a continuous A-linear map. We denote by Pcm(A) the category of pseudocompact right A-modules
thus defined. For example, if A equals R, then we have the equivalence
M → HomR (M, R)
from the opposite of the category Mod R to Pcm(A). In particular, since Mod R is semisimple, so
is Pcm(R).
Recall that a Grothendieck category is an abelian category where all colimits exist, where the
passage to a filtered colimit is an exact functor and which admits a generator; a locally finite
category is a Grothendieck category where each object is the filtered colimit of its subobjects of
finite length.
Theorem A.3. (See [18].)
(a) The category Pcm(A) is an abelian category and the forgetful functor Pcm(A) → Mod R is
exact.
(b) The opposite category Pcm(A)op is a locally finite category.
The main ingredient of the proof of the theorem is the following well-known ‘Mittag–Leffler
lemma’.
Lemma A.4. If
0 → Li → Mi → Ni → 0,

i ∈ I,

is a filtered inverse system of exact sequences of vector spaces and all the Li are finitedimensional, then the inverse limit of the sequence is still exact.
Using classical facts on locally finite Grothendieck categories we deduce the following corollary from the theorem.
Corollary A.5.
(a) The dual of the Krull–Schmidt theorem holds in Pcm(A) (decompositions into possibly infinite products of objects with local endomorphism rings are unique up to permutation and
isomorphism).
(b) Each object of the category Pcm(A) admits a projective cover and a minimal projective
resolution.
(c) The category Pcm(A) is determined, up to equivalence, by its full subcategory of finite-length
objects mod A. More precisely, we have the equivalence
Pcm(A) → Lex(mod A, Mod k),

M → HomA (M, ?) | mod A,

where Lex(mod A, Mod k) is the category of left exact functors from mod A to the category
Mod k of vector spaces.
(d) The category Pcm(A) determines the pseudocompact algebra A up to isomorphism. Namely,
the algebra A is the endomorphism algebra of any minimal projective generator of Pcm(A).

2158

B. Keller, D. Yang / Advances in Mathematics 226 (2011) 2118–2168

Proof. (a) Indeed, the Krull–Schmidt theorem holds in Grothendieck abelian categories by Theorem 1, Section 6, Chapter I of [18].
(b) Indeed, injective hulls exist in an arbitrary Grothendieck category by Theorem 2, Section 6,
Chapter III of [18].
(c) This equivalence is a special case of the general description of the smallest locally finite
(or, more generally, locally noetherian) abelian category containing a given finite length category,
cf. Theorem 1, Section 4, Chapter II of [18].
(d) This follows from the description of finite length categories via pseudocompact algebras
in Section 4, Chapter IV of [18]. ✷
A.6. Pseudocompact modules over Jacobian algebras
Let k be a field of characteristic 0. Let Q be a non-empty finite quiver and W a potential
in kQ. The quiver Q may contain loops and 2-cycles but we assume that W is reduced, i.e. no
cycles of length 2 appear in W (and thus no paths of length 1 occur in the relations deduced
from W ). Let Γ be the complete Ginzburg algebra associated with (Q, W ) and put A = H 0 (Γ ).
Lemma A.7. The algebra A is pseudocompact in the sense of Section A.2, i.e. endowed with its
natural topology, it is complete and separated and there is a basis of neighborhoods of the origin
formed by right ideals I such that A/I is finite-dimensional over k.
Proof. This follows from the fact that Γ is pseudocompact as a dg algebra and Lemma A.12
below. ✷
We consider the category Pcm(A) of pseudocompact modules over A, i.e. topological right
modules which are complete and separated and have a basis of neighborhoods of the origin
formed by submodules of finite codimension over k, cf. Section A.2. As recalled there, the category Pcm(A) is abelian and its opposite category Pcm(A)op is a locally finite Grothendieck
category and therefore has all the good properties enumerated in Corollary A.5. If we combine
parts (c) and (d) of that corollary, we obtain the following corollary.
Corollary A.8. The category mod A of finite-dimensional A-modules determines the algebra A
up to isomorphism.
This yields a positive answer to question 12.1 of [12], where it was asked whether the category
of finite-dimensional modules over the Jacobian algebra of a quiver with potential determined the
Jacobian algebra.
A.9. The pseudocompact derived category of a pseudocompact algebra
Let A be a pseudocompact R-algebra as in Section A.2. We define the pseudocompact derived category of A by Dpc (A) = D(Pcm(A)). Notice that the opposite category Dpc (A)op is
isomorphic to D(Pcm(A)op ) and that Pcm(A)op is a locally finite Grothendieck category. As
shown in [17], cf. also [26], the category of complexes over a Grothendieck category admits a
structure of Quillen model category whose weak equivalences are the quasi-isomorphisms and
whose cofibrations are the monomorphisms. This applies in particular to the category Pcm(A)op .
Notice that the free A-module E = A A is an injective cogenerator of this category and that the

B. Keller, D. Yang / Advances in Mathematics 226 (2011) 2118–2168

2159

algebra A is canonically isomorphic to the endomorphism algebra of E both in Pcm(A) and in
Dpc (A).
Lemma A.10. If a locally finite category A is of finite homological dimension, then the derived
category DA is compactly generated by the simple objects of A. In particular, if the category A =
Pcm(A) is of finite homological dimension, then the opposite Dpc (A)op of the pseudocompact
derived category is compactly generated by the simple A-modules.
Proof. If A is of finite homological dimension, then a complex over A is fibrant-cofibrant for the
above model structure iff it has injective components. Moreover, since A is in particular locally
noetherian, arbitrary coproducts of injective objects are injective. Thus, to check that a simple
object S is compact, it suffices to check that any morphism from S to a coproduct of a family
of complexes with injective components factors through a finite sub-coproduct. This is clear. Let
T be the closure in DA of the simple objects under suspensions, desuspensions, extensions and
arbitrary coproducts. Since T is a compactly generated subcategory of DA, to conclude that T
coincides with DA, it suffices to check that the right orthogonal of T in DA vanishes. Clearly
T contains all objects of finite length. These form a generating family for A. Now it is easy
to check that a complex I of injectives is right orthogonal to T in the category of complexes
modulo homotopy iff I is acyclic. Thus the right orthogonal subcategory of T in DA vanishes
and T equals DA. ✷
A.11. Extension to the dg setting
Let k and R be as in Section A.2. Let A be a differential algebra in the category of graded
R-bimodules. We assume that A is bilaterally pseudocompact, i.e. it is endowed with a complete separated topology admitting a basis of neighborhoods of 0 formed by bilateral differential
graded ideals I of finite total codimension in A.
For example, if Q is a finite graded quiver, we can take R to be the product of copies of
k indexed by the vertices of Q and A to be the completed path algebra, i.e. for each integer
n, the component An is the product of the spaces kc, where c ranges over the paths in Q of
total degree n. We endow A with a continuous differential sending each arrow to a possibly
infinite linear combination of paths of length 2. For each n, we define In to be the ideal
generated by the paths of length n and we define the topology on A to have the In as a basis
of neighborhoods of 0. Then A is bilaterally pseudocompact.
A right dg A-module is pseudocompact if it is endowed with a topology for which it is
complete and separated (in the category of graded A-modules) and which admits a basis of
neighborhoods of 0 formed by dg submodules of finite total codimension. Clearly A is a pseudocompact dg module over itself.
Lemma A.12.
(a) The homology H ∗ (A) is a bilaterally pseudocompact graded R-algebra. In particular,
H 0 (A) is a pseudocompact R-algebra.
(b) For each pseudocompact dg module M, the homology H ∗ (M) is a pseudocompact graded
module over H ∗ (A).

2160

B. Keller, D. Yang / Advances in Mathematics 226 (2011) 2118–2168

Proof. (a) By the Mittag–Leffler Lemma A.4, the homology H ∗ (A) identifies with the limit
of the H ∗ (A/I ), where I runs through a basis of neighborhoods of zero formed by bilateral
dg ideals of finite codimension. This inverse limit is also the inverse limit of the images of the
maps H ∗ (A) → H ∗ (A/I ). Now clearly, the kernels of these maps are of finite codimension
and form a basis of neighborhoods of zero for a complete separated topology on H ∗ (A) (in
the category of graded R-modules). (b) In analogy with (a), the homology H ∗ (M) is endowed
with the topology where a basis of neighborhoods of zero is formed by the kernels of the maps
H ∗ (M) → H ∗ (M/M ), where M runs through a basis of neighborhoods of zero formed by dg
submodules of finite codimension. ✷
A morphism L → M between pseudocompact dg modules is a quasi-isomorphism if it induces an isomorphism H ∗ (L) → H ∗ (M). Let Cpc (A) be the category of pseudocompact dg right
A-modules. It becomes a dg category in the natural way. Let Hpc (A) be the associated zeroth homology category, i.e. the category up to homotopy of pseudocompact dg A-modules. The strictly
perfect derived category of A is the thick subcategory of Hpc (A) generated by the A-module A.
A pseudocompact dg A-module is strictly perfect if it lies in this subcategory.
The opposite algebra Aop is still a bilaterally pseudocompact dg algebra. If A and A are two
ˆ k A . The
bilaterally pseudocompact dg algebras, then so is their completed tensor product A ⊗
ˆ A (this is the
dg algebra A is a pseudocompact dg module over the enveloping algebra Aop ⊗
reason why we use bilaterally pseudocompact algebras).
The bilaterally pseudocompact dg algebra A is topologically homologically smooth if the
ˆ k A is quasi-isomorphic to a
module A considered as a pseudocompact dg module over Aop ⊗
strictly perfect dg module.
Lemma A.13. (See [29].) If A is the completed path algebra of a finite graded quiver endowed
with a continuous differential sending each arrow to a possibly infinite linear combination of
paths of length 2, then A is topologically homologically smooth.
We define the pseudocompact derived category Dpc (A) to be the localization of Hpc (A) at
the class of quasi-isomorphisms. As we will see below, this definition does yield a reasonable
category if A is topologically homologically smooth and concentrated in non-positive degrees.
For arbitrary pseudocompact dg algebras, the category Dpc (A) should be defined with more
care, cf. [37,44,51]. We define the perfect derived category per(A) to be the thick subcategory
of Dpc (A) generated by the free A-module of rank 1. We define the finite-dimensional derived
category Dfd (A) to be the full subcategory whose objects are the pseudocompact dg modules M
such that (Dpc (A))(P , M) is finite-dimensional for each perfect P .
Proposition A.14. Assume that A is topologically homologically smooth and that H p (A) vanishes for all p > 0.
(a) The canonical functor Hpc (A) → Dpc (A) has a left adjoint M → pM.
(b) The triangulated category Dfd (A) is generated by the dg modules of finite dimension concentrated in degree 0.
(c) The full subcategory Dfd (A) of Dpc (A) is contained in the perfect derived category per(A).
In the setup of Section 2.18, it coincides with the subcategory of the same name defined there.
(d) The opposite category Dpc (A)op is compactly generated by Dfd (A).

(e) Let A → A be a quasi-isomorphism of bilaterally pseudocompact, topologically homologically smooth dg algebras whose homology is concentrated in non-positive degrees. Then the
restriction functor Dpc (A ) → Dpc (A) is an equivalence. In particular, if the homology of A
is concentrated in degree 0, there is an equivalence Dpc (A) → Dpc (H 0 A). Moreover, in this
case Dpc (H 0 A) is equivalent to the derived category of the abelian category Pcm(H 0 A).
(f) Assume that A is a complete path algebra as in Section 2.18. There is an equivalence between Dpc (A)op and the localizing subcategory D0 (A) of the ordinary derived category
D(A) generated by the finite-dimensional dg A-modules.
ˆ A-modules where P is strictly
Proof. (a) Let φ : P → A be a quasi-isomorphism of Aop ⊗
perfect. Then the underlying morphism of pseudocompact left A-modules is an homotopy equivalence. Indeed, its cone is contractible since it is acyclic and lies in the thick subcategory of
ˆ k V , where V is a pseudocompact dg k-module. Thus, for each
Hpc (Aop ) generated by the A ⊗
pseudocompact dg A-module M, the induced morphism
ˆAA=M
ˆAP →M ⊗
M⊗
is a quasi-isomorphism. We claim that the canonical map
ˆ A P , ?) → HomDpc (A) (M ⊗
ˆ A P , ?)
HomHpc (A) (M ⊗
ˆ A P is left adjoint to the canonical functor). Indeed,
is bijective (which shows that M → M ⊗
ˆ k A, then the corresince P is strictly perfect, it suffices to show that if we replace P by A ⊗
sponding map is bijective. But we have
ˆ k A) = M ⊗
ˆkA
ˆ A (A ⊗
M⊗
and the functor
ˆ k A, ?) = HomHpc (R) (M, ?)
HomHpc (A) (M ⊗
makes quasi-isomorphisms invertible, which implies the claim.
(b) After replacing A with τ 0 A, cf. Section A.18 below, we may and will assume that the
component Ap vanishes for all p > 0. Then, for each dg module M, in the exact sequence of
complexes
0 → τ<0 M → M → τ

0M

→ 0,

the complex τ<0 M is a dg A-submodule of M. Thus, the sequence is a sequence of dg Amodules. It is clear that the truncation functors τ<0 and τ 0 preserve quasi-isomorphisms and
easy to see that they define t-structures on D(A), Dpc (A) and Dfd (A), cf. Section A.18 below.
Clearly, the t-structure obtained on Dfd (A) is non-degenerate and each object M of its heart
is quasi-isomorphic to the dg module H 0 (M), which is concentrated in degree 0 and finitedimensional. This clearly implies the claim.
(c) Let M be in Dfd (A). By (b), we may assume that M is of finite total dimension. Let P be
ˆ A P is perfect and quasi-isomorphic to M. The second claim
as in the proof of (a). Then M ⊗
follows because the two categories identify with the same full subcategory of per(A).

(d) We have to check that Dpc (A) has arbitrary products. Indeed, they are given by products
of pseudocompact dg modules, which in turn are given by the products of the underlying dg
modules. We have to check that k-finite-dimensional pseudocompact dg modules are co-compact
in Dpc (A). For this, we first observe that they are co-compact in Hpc (A). Now let P be as in
the proof of (a) and let Xi , i ∈ I , be a family of objects of Dpc (A). We consider the space of
morphisms
ˆ A P,M .
Xi ⊗

(HA)
i

Since the module M is finite-dimensional, it is annihilated by some bilateral dg ideal I of finite
codimension in A. Thus the above space of morphisms is isomorphic to
ˆ A (P /P I ), M .
Xi ⊗

(HA)
i

ˆ A (A/I ) = Aop ⊗A (A/I )
Now the bimodule P /P I is perfect as a left dg A-module (since Aop ⊗
is left perfect). Thus, we have the isomorphisms
ˆ A (P /P I ) =
Xi ⊗
i

Xi ⊗A (P /P I ) =
i

Xi ⊗A (P /P I ) .
i

Since M is co-compact in HA, we find the isomorphism
Xi ⊗A (P /P I ) , M =

(HA)
i

(HA) Xi ⊗A (P /P I ), M .
i

Now the last space is isomorphic to
ˆ A P , M) =
(HA)(Xi ⊗
i

(DA)(Xi , M).
i

Finally, we have to show that the left orthogonal of Dfd (A) vanishes in Dpc (A). Indeed, if M
belongs to the left orthogonal of Dfd (A), then all the maps M → M/M , where M is a dg submodule of finite codimension, vanish in Dpc (A). Thus the maps H ∗ (M) → H ∗ (M/M ) vanish.
But H ∗ (M) is the inverse limit of the system of the H ∗ (M/M ), where M ranges over a basis
of neighborhoods formed by dg submodules of finite codimension. So H ∗ (M) vanishes and M
vanishes in Dpc (A).
(e) Let R : Dpc (A ) → Dpc (A) be the restriction functor. Let P be as in the proof of (a). Then
ˆ A P) ⊗
ˆ A A . It is easy to check that R and L
R admits the left adjoint L given by M → (M ⊗
induce quasi-inverse equivalences between per(A) and per(A ). An object M of per(A) belongs
to the subcategory Dfd (A) if and only if the space Homper(A) (P , M) is finite-dimensional for
each P in per(A). Therefore, the equivalences L and R must induce quasi-inverse equivalences
between Dfd (A) and Dfd (A ). Clearly the functor R commutes with arbitrary products. Now the

B. Keller, D. Yang / Advances in Mathematics 226 (2011) 2118–2168

2163

claim follows from (c). We obtain the equivalence between Dpc (A) and Dpc (H 0 A) by using the
quasi-isomorphism
A←τ

0A → H

0

A.

The canonical functor D(Pcm(H 0 A)) → Dpc (H 0 A) is an equivalence because its restriction to
the subcategory of finite-dimensional dg modules concentrated in degree 0 is an equivalence and
this subcategory compactly generates the opposites of both categories.
(f) Let H0 (A) be the full subcategory of H(A) formed by the dg modules which are filtered
unions of their finite-dimensional submodules and let Ac0 (A) be its full subcategory formed by
the acyclic dg modules N such that each finite-dimensional dg submodule of N is contained
in an acyclic finite-dimensional dg submodule. Notice that the quotient H0 (A)/Ac0 (A) inherits
arbitrary coproducts from H0 (A). We have a natural functor
H0 (A)/Ac0 (A) → D0 (A)
and a natural duality functor
H0 (A)/Ac0 (A) → Dpc (A)

op

taking M to HomR (M, R). We will show that H0 (A)/Ac0 (A) is compactly generated by its full
subcategory F of finite-dimensional dg modules and that the above functors induce equivalences
∼
F−
→
Dfd (A)

∼
and F −
→
Dfd (A)op .

Since the functors
H0 (A)/Ac0 (A) → D0 (A)

and H0 (A)/Ac0 (A) → Dpc (A)

op

both commute with arbitrary coproducts, they must be equivalences because Dfd (A) compactly
generates D0 (A) (by Theorem 2.19) and its opposite compactly generates Dpc (A)op (by part (d)).
So let us show that F consists of compact objects. Indeed, it follows from the definition of
Ac0 (A) that for an object F of F , the category of Ac0 (A)-quasi-isomorphisms F → F with
finite-dimensional F is cofinal in the category of all Ac0 (A)-quasi-isomorphisms with target F .
Now it follows from the calculus of fractions that F is compact in H0 (A)/Ac0 (A). Moreover,
we see that F is naturally equivalent to the category Hfd (A)/Acfd (A) of Section 2.18. Now the
fact that both functors
∼
F−
→
Dfd (A)

∼
and F −
→
Dfd (A)op

are equivalences follows from part (a) of Theorem 2.19.

A.15. The Calabi–Yau property
Keep the assumptions on k, R, A from Section A.11. In particular, A is assumed to be topologically homologically smooth. For two objects L and M of Dpc (A), define
RHomA (L, M) = HomA (pL, M).

ˆ k A and define
Put Ae = Aop ⊗
Ω = RHomAe A, Ae .
Lemma A.16. (See [32].) We have a canonical isomorphism
ˆ A Ω, L)
D Hom(L, M) = Hom(M ⊗
bifunctorial in L ∈ Dfd (A) and M ∈ Dpc (A).
Let n be an integer. For an object L of Dpc (Ae ), define
L# = RHomAe L, Ae [n].
The dg algebra A is n-Calabi–Yau as a bimodule if there is an isomorphism
∼
f :A −
→
A#

in Dcd (Ae ) such that f # = f . The preceding lemma implies that in this case, the category Dfd (A)
is n-Calabi–Yau as a triangulated category.
Theorem A.17. (See [29].) Completed Ginzburg algebras are topologically homologically
smooth and 3-Calabi–Yau.
A.18. t-Structure
Keep the assumptions on k, R, A from the preceding section. Let us assume that H n (A)
vanishes for all n > 0. We have the truncated complex τ 0 A, which becomes a dg algebra
in a natural way. The dg algebra τ 0 A is still a bilaterally pseudo-compact and topologically
homologically smooth. Indeed, we have τ 0 (A/I ) = τ 0 (A)/τ 0 I for each dg ideal I of A,
which yields that τ 0 A is bilaterally pseudo-compact. Moreover, the morphism τ 0 A → A is a
quasi-isomorphism, which yields the homological smoothness. Let us therefore assume that the
components An vanish in all degrees n > 0.
Lemma A.19.
(a) For each pseudocompact dg A-module M, the truncations τ 0 M and τ>0 M are pseudocompact dg A-modules.
(b) The functors τ 0 and τ>0 define a t-structure on Dpc (A).
(c) The heart of the t-structure is canonically equivalent to the category Pcm(H 0 (A)) of pseudocompact modules over the pseudocompact algebra H 0 (A).
Proof. (a) Let M be a dg submodule of M. The canonical map
Z 0 (M)/Z 0 M → Z 0 M/M

B. Keller, D. Yang / Advances in Mathematics 226 (2011) 2118–2168

2165

is an isomorphism because the map B 1 (M ) → B 1 (M) is injective. Thus, we have an isomorphism
τ

0M

= lim τ

0 (M)/τ 0

M

,

where M ranges through a basis of neighborhoods of 0 formed by dg submodules of finite
codimension. It follows that τ 0 M is endowed with a complete separated topology and is pseudocompact. Similarly for τ>0 M = M/τ 0 M.
(b) They define functors in the homotopy categories which preserve quasi-isomorphisms and
thus descend to Dpc (A). As in the proof of Lemma 5.2, it is not hard to check that the induced
functors define a t-structure.
(c) We omit the proof, which is completely analogous to that of part (b) of Lemma 5.2. ✷
A.20. Jacobi-finite quivers with potentials
Let k be a field and R a finite-dimensional separable k-algebra. Let A be a dg R-algebra which
is bilaterally pseudocompact (Section A.11). Assume moreover that
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)

A is topologically homologically smooth (Section A.11),
for each p > 0, the space H p A vanishes,
the algebra H 0 (A) is finite-dimensional,
A is 3-Calabi–Yau as a bimodule (Section A.15).

Thanks to assumption (1), the finite-dimensional derived category Dfd (A) is contained in the
perfect derived category. The generalized cluster category [1] is the triangle quotient C =
per(A)/Dfd (A). Let π be the canonical projection functor.
Theorem A.21. The generalized cluster category C is Hom-finite and 2-Calabi–Yau. The object
π(A) is cluster-tilting in C.
This theorem was proved for non-topological dg algebras A by C. Amiot, cf. Theorem 2.1
of [1]. Using the material of the preceding sections, one can easily imitate Amiot’s proof to obtain
the above topological version. We leave the details to the reader. In particular, by Theorem A.17,
the statement holds for complete Ginzburg dg algebras associated with quivers with potential
(Q, W ), where W belongs to the completed path algebra of Q and the Jacobian algebra is finitedimensional.
A.22. Mutation
Let (Q, W ) be a quiver with potential and let Γ be the associated completed Ginzburg dg
algebra. By definition, Γ is concentrated in non-positive degrees and by Theorem A.17, it is
topologically homologically smooth and 3-Calabi–Yau. Let i be a vertex of Q such that conditions (c1), (c2) and (c3) of Section 2.4 hold. Let (Q , W ) be the mutation μ˜ i (Q, W ) and Γ the
associated Ginzburg dg algebra.

Theorem A.23.
(a) There is a triangle equivalence
→ Dpc (Γ )

Fpc : Dpc Γ

which sends the Pj to Pj for j = i and to the cone Ti over the morphism
Pi →

Pt (α)
α

for i = j , where we have a summand Pt (α) for each arrow α of Q with source i and the
corresponding component of the map is the left multiplication by α. The functor Fpc restricts
to triangle equivalences from per(Γ ) to per(Γ ) and from Dfd (Γ ) to Dfd (Γ ).
(b) Let Γred respectively Γred be the complete Ginzburg dg algebra associated with the reduction of (Q, W ) respectively the reduction μi (Q, W ) of μ˜ i (Q, W ). The functor Fpc yields a
triangle equivalence
Fred : Dpc Γred → Dpc (Γred ),
which restricts to triangle equivalences from per(Γred ) to per(Γred ) and from Dfd (Γred ) to
Dfd (Γred ).
Remark A.24. By combining the theorem with the facts on t-structures from Section A.18 we
obtain a comparison of the categories of pseudocompact modules
Pcm H 0 (Γ )

and

Pcm H 0 Γ

completely analogous to the one in Section 5.3.
Proof of Theorem A.23. (a) Let X be the Γ –Γ -bimodule constructed in Section 3.4. It gives
rise to a pair of adjoint functors: the left adjoint Fpc : Dpc (Γ ) → Dpc (Γ ) is the left derived funcˆ Γ X. The right adjoint Gpc is induced by
tor of the completed tensor product functor M → M ⊗
the functor HomΓ (X, ?). These functors restrict to a pair of adjoint functors between Dfd (Γ ) and
Dfd (Γ ). The induced functors are isomorphic to those of Proposition 3.13. Indeed, by Proposition A.14, the categories Dfd are contained in the perfect derived categories and the canonical
morphism from the left derived functor of the (non-completed) tensor product M → M ⊗Γ X to
Fpc restricts to an isomorphism on the perfect derived category and similarly for Gpc . Thus, the
restriction of Gpc is an equivalence from Dfd (Γ ) to Dfd (Γ ). Moreover, the functor Gpc commutes with arbitrary products since it admits a left adjoint. It follows that Gpc is an equivalence
since the opposites of the categories Dpc are compactly generated by the subcategories Dfd , by
Proposition A.14.
(b) This follows from (a) and part (e) of Proposition A.14. ✷
