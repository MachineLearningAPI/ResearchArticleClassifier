Abstract
We use the method of interlacing families of polynomials introduced in [MSS13] to prove
two theorems known to imply a positive solution to the Kadison–Singer problem.
The first is Weaver’s conjecture KS2 [Wea04], which is known to imply Kadison–Singer
via a projection paving conjecture of Akemann and Anderson [AA91]. The second is a
formulation due to Casazza, et al., [CEKP07] of Anderson’s original paving conjecture(s)
[And79a, And79b, And81], for which we are able to compute explicit paving bounds.
The proof involves an analysis of the largest roots of a family of polynomials that we call
the “mixed characteristic polynomials” of a collection of matrices.

Introduction

In their 1959 paper, R. Kadison and I. Singer [KS59] posed the following fundamental question.
Question 1.1 (Kadison-Singer Problem). Does every pure state on the (abelian) von Neumann
algebra D of bounded diagonal operators on ℓ2 have a unique extension to a pure state on B(ℓ2 ),
the von Neumann algebra of all bounded operators on ℓ2 ?
A positive answer to Question 1.1 has been shown to be equivalent to a number of conjectures
spanning numerous fields, including Anderson’s paving conjectures [And79a, And79b, And81],
Weaver’s discrepancy theoretic KSr and KSr′ conjectures [Wea04], the Bourgain-Tzafriri Conjecture [BT89, CT06], and the Feichtinger Conjecture and the Rǫ -Conjecture [CCLV05]; and
was known to be implied by Akemann and Anderson’s projection paving conjecture [AA91,
Conjecture 7.1.3]. Many approaches to these problems have been proposed; and, under slightly
stronger hypothesis, partial solutions have been found by Berman et al. [BHKW88], Bourgain
and Tzafriri [BT91, BT89], Paulsen [Pau11], Baranov and Dyakonov [BD11], Lawton [Law10],
Akemann et al. [AAT12], and Popa [Pop13]. For a discussion of the history and a host of other
related conjectures, we refer the reader to [CFTW06].
We prove these conjectures by proving Weaver’s [Wea04] conjecture KS2 which, as amended
by [Wea04, Theorem 2], says
Conjecture 1.2 (KS2 ). There exist universal constants η ≥ 2 and θ > 0 so that the following
holds. Let w1 , . . . , wm ∈ Cd satisfy wi ≤ 1 for all i and suppose
m

i=1

| u, wi |2 = η

(1)

for every unit vector u ∈ Cd . Then there exists a partition S1 , S2 of {1, . . . , m} so that
i∈Sj

| u, wi |2 ≤ η − θ,

(2)

for every unit vector u ∈ Cd and each j ∈ {1, 2}.
Akemann and Anderson’s projection paving conjecture [AA91, Conjecture 7.1.3] follows directly from KS2 (see [Wea04, p. 229]).
We also give a proof of Anderson’s original paving conjecture, which says
Conjecture 1.3 (Anderson Paving). For every ǫ > 0 there is an r ∈ N such that for every n × n
self-adjoint complex matrix T with zero diagonal, there are diagonal projections P1 , . . . , Pr with
r
i=1 Pi = I such that
Pi T Pi ≤ ǫ T
for i = 1, . . . , r.
A similar conjecture is made by Bourgain and Tzafri [BT89, Conjecture 2.8]. One difference
between the paving conjecture and KS2 is that the paving conjecture can be extended to infinite
operators T ∈ B(ℓ2 ) by an elementary compactness argument [And79a], which then gives an
immediate resolution of Kadison-Singer in a manner described in the original paper [KS59,
Lemma 5]. On the other hand, the reduction from Kadison-Singer to Akemann and Anderson’s
projection paving conjecture requires non-elementary operator theory.
Our main result follows. Its proof appears at the end of Section 5.

and Ahlswede and Winter [AW02], which imply in our setting that
i=1 vi vi ≤ C(ǫ) · log n
with high probability. Here we are able to control the deviation at the much smaller scale
√
(1 + ǫ)2 , but only with nonzero probability.
Our theorem easily implies the following generalization of Conjecture 1.2.
Corollary 1.5. Let r be a positive integer and let u1 , . . . , um ∈ Cd be vectors such that
m

ui u∗i = I,
i=1

and ui

ui ui ∗ ≤

for j = 1, . . . , r.

(5)

If we set r = 2 and δ = 1/18, this implies Conjecture 1.2 for η = 18 and θ = 2. To see this,
√
set ui = wi / η. Weaver’s condition (1) becomes i ui u∗i = I, and δ = 1/η. When we multiply
back by η, the result (5) becomes (2) with η − θ = 16.
Corollary 1.5 also implies Conjecture 1.3 with r = (6/ǫ)4 ; we defer the (slightly more involved) proof to Section 6.
Proof of Corollary 1.5. For each i ∈ [m] and k ∈ [r], define wi,k ∈ Crd to be the direct sum of r
vectors from Cd , all of which are 0d (the 0-vector in Cd ) except for the kth one which is a copy
of ui . That is,

Overview

We prove Theorem 1.4 using the “method of interlacing families of polynomials” introduced in
[MSS13], which we review in Section 3.1. Interlacing families of polynomials have the property
that they always contain at least one polynomial whose largest root is at most the largest root
of the sum of the polynomials in the family. In Section 4, we prove that the characteristic
polynomials of the matrices that arise in Theorem 1.4 are such a family.
This proof requires us to consider the expected characteristic polynomials of certain sums of
independent rank-1 positive semidefinite Hermitian matrices. We call such an expected polynomial a mixed characteristic polynomial. To prove that the polynomials that arise in our proof
are an interlacing family, we show that all mixed characteristic polynomials are real rooted.
Inspired by Borcea and Br¨
and´en’s proof of Johnson’s Conjecture [BB08], we do this by constructing multivariate real stable polynomials, and then applying operators that preserve real
stability until we obtain the (univariate) mixed characteristic polynomials.
We then need to bound the largest root of the expected characteristic polynomial. We do this
in Section 5 through a multivariate generalization of the barrier function argument of Batson,
Spielman, and Srivastava [BSS12]. The original argument essentially considers the behavior of
the roots of a real rooted univariate polynomial p(x) under the operator 1 − ∂/∂x . It does this
by keeping track of an upper bound on the roots of the polynomial, along with a measure of
how far above the roots this upper bound is. We refer to this measure as the “barrier function”.
In our multivariate generalization, we consider a vector x to be above the roots of a real
stable multivariate polynomial p(x1 , . . . , xm ) if p(y1 , . . . , ym ) is non-zero for every vector y that
4

is at least as big as x in every coordinate. The value of our multivariate barrier function at
x is the vector of the univariate barrier functions obtained by restricting to each coordinate.
We then show that we are able to control the values of the barrier function when operators of
the form 1 − ∂/∂xi are applied to the polynomial. Our proof is inspired by a method used by
Gurvits [Gur08] to prove the van der Waerden Conjecture and a generalization by Bapat [Bap89]
of this conjecture to mixed discriminants. Gurvits’s proof examines a sequence of polynomials
similar to those we construct in our proof, and amounts to proving a lower bound on the constant
term of the mixed characteristic polynomial.

Preliminaries

For an integer m, we let [m] = {1, . . . , m}. We write [m]
to indicate the collection of subsets
k
of [m] having k elements. When z1 , . . . , zm are variables and S ⊆ [m], we define z S = i∈S zi .
We write ∂zi to indicate the operator that performs partial differentiation in zi , ∂/∂zi . For
a multivariate polynomial p(z1 , . . . , zm ) and a number x, we write p(z1 , . . . , zm ) z1 =x to indicate
the restricted polynomial in z2 , . . . , zm obtained by setting z1 to x.
As usual, we write x to indicate the Euclidean 2-norm of a vector x. For a matrix M ,
we indicate the operator norm by M = max x =1 M x . When M is Hermitian positive
semidefinite, we recall that this is the largest eigenvalue of M .
We write P and E for the probability of an event and for the expectation of a random variable,
respectively.

3.1

Interlacing Families

We now recall the definition of interlacing families of polynomials from [MSS13], and its main
consequence. We say that a univariate polynomial is real rooted if all of its coefficients and roots
are real.
Definition 3.1. We say that a real rooted polynomial g(x) = α0
rooted polynomial f (x) = β0 ni=1 (x − βi ) if

n−1
i=1 (x − αi )

interlaces a real

β1 ≤ α1 ≤ β2 ≤ α2 ≤ · · · ≤ αn−1 ≤ βn .
We say that polynomials f1 , . . . , fk have a common interlacing if there is a polynomial g so that
g interlaces fi for each i.
In [MSS13], we proved the following elementary lemma that shows the utility of having a
common interlacing.
Lemma 3.2. Let f1 , . . . , fk be polynomials of the same degree that are real-rooted and have
positive leading coefficients. Define
k

fi .

f∅ =
i=1

If f1 , . . . , fk have a common interlacing, then there exists an i so that the largest root of fi is at
most the largest root of f∅ .

5

In many cases of interest, we are faced with polynomials that are indexed naturally by a
cartesian product, and it is beneficial to apply Lemma 3.2 inductively to subcollections of the
polynomials rather than at once. This inspires the following definition from [MSS13]:
Definition 3.3. Let S1 , . . . , Sm be finite sets and for every assignment s1 , . . . , sm ∈ S1 ×· · ·×Sm
let fs1 ,...,sm (x) be a real-rooted degree n polynomial with positive leading coefficient. For a partial
assignment s1 , . . . , sk ∈ S1 × . . . × Sk with k < m, define
def

fs1 ,...,sk ,sk+1 ,...,sm ,

fs1,...,sk =

sk+1 ∈Sk+1 ,...,sm ∈Sm

as well as

def

fs1 ,...,sm .

f∅ =

s1 ∈S1 ,...,sm ∈Sm

We say that the polynomials {fs1 ,...,sm } form an interlacing family if for all k = 0, . . . , m − 1,
and all s1 , . . . , sk ∈ S1 × · · · × Sk , the polynomials
{fs1 ,...,sk ,t }t∈Sk+1
have a common interlacing.
Theorem 3.4. Let S1 , . . . , Sm be finite sets and let {fs1 ,...,sm } be an interlacing family of polynomials. Then, there exists some s1 , . . . , sm ∈ S1 × · · · × Sm so that the largest root of fs1 ,...,sm
is at most the largest root of f∅ .
Proof. From the definition of an interlacing family, we know that the polynomials {ft } for t ∈ S1
have a common interlacing and that their sum is f∅ . So, Lemma 3.2 tells us that one of the
polynomials ft has largest root at most the largest root of f∅ . We now proceed inductively.
For any s1 , . . . , sk , we know that the polynomials {fs1 ,...,sk ,t } for t ∈ Sk+1 have a common
interlacing and that their sum is fs1 ,...,sk . So, for some choice of t (say sk+1 ) the largest root of
the polynomial fs1 ,...,sk+1 is at most the largest root of fs1 ,...,sk .
We will prove that the polynomials {fs } defined in Section 4 form an interlacing family. According to Definition 3.3, this requires establishing the existence of certain common interlacings.
There is a systematic way to show that polynomials have common interlacings by proving that
convex combinations of those polynomials are real rooted. In particular the following result
seems to have been discovered a number of times. It appears as Theorem 2.1 of Dedieu [Ded92],
(essentially) as Theorem 2′ of Fell [Fel80], and as (a special case of) Theorem 3.6 of Chudnovsky
and Seymour [CS07].
Lemma 3.5. Let f1 , . . . , fk be (univariate) polynomials of the same degree with positive leading
coefficients. Then f1 , . . . , fk have a common interlacing if and only if ki=1 λi fi is real rooted
for all convex combinations λi ≥ 0, ki=1 λi = 1.

3.2

Stable Polynomials

Our results employ tools from the theory of stable polynomials, a generalization of real rootedness to multivariate polynomials. For a complex number z, let Im(z) denote its imaginary part.
We recall that a polynomial p(z1 , . . . , zm ) ∈ C[z1 , . . . , zm ] is stable if whenever Im(zi ) > 0 for all
i, p(z1 , . . . , zm ) = 0. A polynomial p is real stable if it is stable and all of its coefficients are real.
A univariate polynomial is real stable if and only if it is real rooted (as defined at the beginning
of Section 3.1).
To prove that the polynomials we construct in this paper are real stable, we begin with an
observation of Borcea and Br¨
and´en [BB08, Proposition 2.4].
Proposition 3.6. If A1 , . . . , Am are positive semidefinite Hermitian matrices, then the polynomial
zi Ai

det
i

is real stable.
We will generate new real stable polynomials from the one above by applying operators of
the form (1− ∂zi ). One can use general results, such as Theorem 1.3 of [BB10] or Proposition 2.2
of [LS81], to prove that these operators preserve real stability. It is also easy to prove it directly using the fact that the analogous operator on univariate polynomials preserves stability of
polynomials with complex coefficients. For example, the following theorem appears as Corollary
18.2a in Marden [Mar85], and is similar to Corollary 5.4.1 of Rahman and Schmeisser [RS02].
Theorem 3.7. If all the zeros of a degree d polynomial q(z) lie in a (closed) circular region A,
then for λ ∈ C, all the zeros of
q(z) − λq ′ (z)
lie in the convex region swept out by translating A in the magnitude and direction of the vector
dλ.
Corollary 3.8. If p ∈ R[z1 , . . . , zm ] is real stable, then so is
(1 − ∂z1 )p(z1 , . . . , zm ).
Proof. Let x2 , . . . , xm be numbers with positive imaginary part. Then, the univariate polynomial
q(z1 ) = p(z1 , z2 , . . . , zm )

z2 =x2 ,...,zm =xm

is stable. That is, all of its zeros lie in the circular region consisting of numbers with non-positive
imaginary part. As this region is invariant under translation by d, (1 − ∂z1 )q(z) is stable. This
implies that (1−∂z1 )p has no roots in which all of the variables have positive imaginary part.
We will also use the fact that real stability is preserved under setting variables to real numbers
(see, for instance, [Wag11, Lemma 2.4(d)]).
Proposition 3.9. If p ∈ R[z1 , . . . , zm ] is real stable and a ∈ R, then p|z1 =a = p(a, z2 , . . . , zm ) ∈
R[z2 , . . . , zm ] is real stable.

Facts from Linear Algebra

For a matrix M ∈ Cd×d we write the characteristic polynomial of M in a variable x as
χ [M ] (x) = det (xI − M ) .
The following identity is sometimes known as the matrix determinant lemma or the rank-1
update formula.
Lemma 3.10. If A is an invertible matrix and u, v are vectors, then
det (A + uv ∗ ) = det (A) (1 + v ∗ A−1 u)
We will utilize Jacobi’s formula for the derivative of the determinant of a matrix, which can
be derived from Lemma 3.10.
Theorem 3.11. For an invertible matrix A and another matrix B of the same dimensions,
∂t det (A + tB) = det (A) Tr A−1 B .
We require two standard facts about traces. The first is that for a k-by-n matrix A and an
n-by-k matrix B,
Tr (AB) = Tr (BA) .
The second is
Lemma 3.12. If A and B are positive semidefinite matrices of the same dimension, then
Tr (AB) ≥ 0.
One can prove this by decomposing A and B into sums of rank-1 positive semidefinite
matrices, using linearity of the trace, and then the first fact about traces.

The Mixed Characteristic Polynomial

Theorem 4.1. Let v1 , . . . , vm be independent random column vectors in Cd with finite support.
For each i, let Ai = E vi vi∗ . Then,
vi vi∗ (x) =

(6)

In particular, the expected characteristic polynomial of a sum of independent rank one
Hermitian matrices is a function of the covariance matrices Ai . We call this polynomial the
mixed characteristic polynomial of A1 , . . . , Am , and denote it by µ [A1 , . . . , Am ] (x).
The proof of Theorem 4.1 relies on the following simple identity which shows that random
rank one updates of determinants correspond in a natural way to differential operators.
Lemma 4.2. For every square matrix A and random vector v, we have
E det (A − vv ∗ ) = (1 − ∂t ) det A + t E vv ∗
8

t=0

(7)

Proof. First, assume A is invertible. By Lemma 3.10, we have
E det (A − vv ∗ ) = E det (A) (1 − v ∗ A−1 v)
= E det (A) (1 − Tr A−1 vv ∗ )
= det (A) − det (A) E Tr A−1 vv ∗
= det (A) − det (A) Tr A−1 E vv ∗
On the other hand, by Theorem 3.11, we have
(1 − ∂t ) det A + t E vv ∗ = det A + t E vv ∗ − det (A) Tr A−1 E vv ∗ .
The claim follows by setting t = 0.
If A is not invertible, we can choose a sequence of invertible matrices that approach A. Since
identity (7) holds for each matrix in the sequence and the two sides are polynomials in the entries
of the matrix, a continuity argument implies that the identity must hold for A as well.
We prove Theorem 4.1 by applying this lemma inductively.
Proof of Theorem 4.1. We will show by induction on k that for every matrix M ,

as desired.
Remark 4.3. The proof of Theorem 4.1 given here (using induction and Lemma 4.2) was
suggested to us by James Lee. The slightly longer proof that appeared in our original manuscript
was not inductive; rather, it utilized the Cauchy–Binet formula to show the equality of each
coefficient.
9

Now it is immediate from Proposition 3.6 and Corollary 3.8 that the mixed characteristic
polynomial is real rooted.
Corollary 4.4. The mixed characteristic polynomial of positive semidefinite matrices is real
rooted.
Proof. Proposition 3.6 tells us that
m

det xI +

is real stable. Corollary 3.8 tells us that
m

m
i=1

zi Ai

det xI +

1 − ∂zi

is real stable as well. Finally, Proposition 3.9 shows that setting all of the zi to zero preserves
real stability. As the resulting polynomial is univariate, it is real rooted.
Finally, we use the real rootedness of mixed characteristic polynomials to show that every
sequence of independent finitely supported random vectors v1 , . . . , vm defines an interlacing
family. Let li be the size of the support of the random vector vi , and let vi take the values
wi,1 , . . . , wi,li with probabilities pi,1 , . . . , pi,li . For j1 ∈ [l1 ], . . . , jm ∈ [lm ], define

Also, let

We need to prove that for every partial assignment j1 , . . . , jk (possibly empty), the polynomials
{qj1 ,...,jk ,t (x)}t=1,...,lk+1
have a common interlacing.
By Lemma 3.5, it suffices to prove that for every nonnegative λ1 , . . . , λlk+1 summing to one,
the polynomial
lk+1

λt qj1 ,...,jk ,t (x)
t=1

10

is real rooted. To show this, let uk+1 be a random vector that equals wk+1,t with probability λt .
Then, the above polynomial equals

The Multivariate Barrier Argument

In this section we will prove an upper bound on the roots of the mixed characteristic polynomial
µ [A1 , . . . , Am ] (x) as a function of the Ai , in the case of interest m
i=1 Ai = I. Our main theorem
is:
Theorem 5.1. Suppose A1 , . . . , Am are Hermitian positive semidefinite matrices satisfying
m
Ai = I and Tr (Ai ) ≤ ǫ for all i. Then the largest root of µ [A1 , . . . , Am ] (x) is at most
i=1√
(1 + ǫ)2 .
We begin by deriving a slightly different expression for µ [A1 , . . . , Am ] (x) that allows us to
reason separately about the effect of each Ai on its roots.
Lemma 5.2. Let A1 , . . . , Am be Hermitian positive semidefinite matrices. If

i Ai

= I, then

m

µ [A1 , . . . , Am ] (x) =
i=1

1 − ∂yi

det
i=1

y1 =···=ym =x

.

(8)

Proof. For any differentiable function f , we have
∂yi (f (yi ))

yi =zi +x

= ∂zi f (zi + x).

So, the lemma follows by substituting yi = zi + x into expression (8), and observing that it
produces the expression on the right hand side of (6).
Let us write
µ [A1 , . . . , Am ] (x) = Q(x, x, . . . , x),

(9)

where Q(y1 , . . . , ym ) is the multivariate polynomial on the right hand side of (8). The bound
on the roots of µ [A1 , . . . , Am ] (x) will follow from a “multivariate upper bound” on the roots of
Q, defined as follows.
Definition 5.3. Let p(z1 , . . . , zm ) be a multivariate polynomial. We say that z ∈ Rm is above
the roots of p if
p(z + t) > 0

for all

t = (t1 , . . . , tm ) ∈ Rm , ti ≥ 0,

i.e., if p is positive on the nonnegative orthant with origin at z.
11

We will denote the set of points which are above the roots of p by Abp . To prove Theorem 5.1,
√
it is sufficient by (9) to show that (1 + ǫ)2 · 1 ∈ AbQ , where 1 is the all-ones vector. We will
achieve this by an inductive “barrier function” argument. In particular, we will construct Q by
iteratively applying operations of the form (1 − ∂yi ), and we will track the locations of the roots
of the polynomials that arise in this process by studying the evolution of the functions defined
below.
Definition 5.4. Given a real stable polynomial p and a point z = (z1 , . . . , zm ) ∈ Abp , the
barrier function of p in direction i at z is
Φip (z) =

∂zi p(z)
= ∂zi log p(z).
p(z)

Equivalently, we may define Φip by

qz,i (t) = p(z1 , . . . , zi−1 , t, zi+1 , . . . , zm )

(11)

has roots λ1 , . . . , λr , which are real by Proposition 3.9.
Although the Φip are m−variate functions, the properties that we require of them may be
deduced by considering their bivariate restrictions. We establish these properties by exploiting
the following powerful characterization of bivariate real stable polynomials. It is stated in the
form we want by Borcea and Br¨
and´en [BB10, Corollary 6.7], and is proved using an adaptation
of a result of Helton and Vinnikov [HV07] by Lewis, Parrilo and Ramana [LPR05].
Lemma 5.5. If p(z1 , z2 ) is a bivariate real stable polynomial of degree exactly d, then there exist
d-by-d positive semidefinite matrices A, B and a Hermitian matrix C such that
p(z1 , z2 ) = ± det(z1 A + z2 B + C).
Remark 5.6. We can also conclude that for every z1 , z2 > 0, z1 A + z2 B must be positive
definite. If this were not the case, then there would be a nonzero vector that is in the nullspace
of both A and B. This would cause the degree of the polynomial to be lower than d.
The two analytic properties of the barrier functions that we use are that, above the roots of
a polynomial, they are nonincreasing and convex in every coordinate.
Lemma 5.7. Suppose p is real stable and z ∈ Abp . Then for all i, j ≤ m and δ ≥ 0,
Φip (z + δej ) ≤ Φip (z), and

Φip (z + δej ) ≤ Φip (z) + δ · ∂zj Φip (z + δej )

12

(monotonicity)

(12)

(convexity).

(13)

Proof. If i = j, then we consider the real-rooted univariate restriction qz,i (zi ) = rk=1 (zi − λk )
defined in (11). Since z ∈ Abp we know that zi > λk for all k. Monotonicity follows immediately
by considering each term in (10), and convexity is easily established by computing
∂z2i

1
zi − λk

=

2
>0
(zi − λk )3

as zi > λk .

In the case i = j we fix all variables other than zi and zj and consider the bivariate restriction
qz,ij (zi , zj ) = p(z1 , . . . , zm ).
By Lemma 5.5 there are Hermitian positive semidefinite Bi , Bj and a Hermitian matrix C such
that
qz,ij (zi , zj ) = ± det(zi Bi + zj Bj + C).

Remark 5.6 allows us to conclude that the sign is positive: for sufficiently large t, t(Bi + Bj ) + C
is positive definite and for t ≥ max(z1 , z2 ) qz,ij (t, t) > 0.
The barrier function in direction i can now be simply expressed as
Φip (z) =
=

∂zi det(zi Bi + zj Bj + C)
det(zi Bi + zj Bj + C)
det(zi Bi + zj Bj + C)Tr (zi Bi + zj Bj + C)−1 Bi
det(zi Bi + zj Bj + C)

by Theorem 3.11

= Tr (zi Bi + zj Bj + C)−1 Bi
Let M = (zi Bi + zj Bj + C). As z ∈ Abp and Bi + Bj is positive definite, we can conclude that
M is positive definite: if it were not, there would be a t for which det (M + t(Bi + Bj )) = 0.
We now write
Φip (z + δej ) = Tr (M + δBj )−1 Bi
= Tr M −1 (I + δBj M −1 )−1 Bi
= Tr (I + δBj M −1 )−1 Bi M −1 .
For δ sufficiently small, we may expand (I + δBj M −1 )−1 in a power series as
I − δBj M −1 + δ2 (Bj M −1 )2 +

(−δBj M −1 )ν .
ν≥3

Thus,
∂zj Φip (z) = −Tr Bj M −1 Bi M −1 .

To see that this is non-positive, and thereby prove (12), observe that both Bj and M −1 Bi M −1
are positive semidefinite, and recall from Lemma 3.12 that the trace of the product of positive
semidefinite matrices is non-negative. To prove convexity, observe that the second derivative is
non-negative because
∂z2j Φip (z) = Tr (Bj M −1 )2 Bi M −1 = Tr (Bj M −1 Bj )(M −1 Bi M −1 )
is also the trace of the product of positive semidefinite matrices.
Inequality (13) is equivalent to convexity in direction ej and may be obtained by observing
that f (x + δ) ≤ f (x) + δf ′ (x + δ) for any convex differentiable f .
13

Remark 5.8. There are other ways of proving Lemma 5.7 that go through more elementary
techniques than those used by Helton and Vinnikov [HV07]. James Renegar has pointed out
that it follows from Corollary 4.6 of [BGLS01]. Terence Tao [Tao13] has also presented a more
elementary proof.
Recall that we are interested in finding points that lie in AbQ , where Q is generated by applying several operators of the form 1 − ∂zi to the polynomial det( m
i=1 zi Ai ). The purpose of the
“barrier functions” Φip is to allow us to reason about the relationship between Abp and Abp−∂zi p ;
in particular, the monotonicity property alone immediately implies the following statement.
Lemma 5.9. Suppose that p is real stable, that z is above its roots, and that Φip (z) < 1. Then
z is above the roots of p − ∂zi p.
Proof. Let t be a nonnegative vector. As Φ is nonincreasing in each coordinate we have Φip (z +
t) < 1, whence
∂zi p(z + t) < p(z + t) =⇒ (p − ∂zi p)(x + t) > 0,
as desired.
Lemma 5.9 allows us to prove that a vector is above the roots of p − ∂zi p. However, it is
not strong enough for an inductive argument because the barrier functions can increase with
each 1 − ∂zi operator that we apply. To remedy this, we will require the barrier functions to be
bounded away from 1, and we will compensate for the effect of each 1 − ∂zj operation by shifting
our upper bound away from zero in direction ej . In particular, by exploiting the convexity
properties of the Φip , we arrive at the following strengthening of Lemma 5.9.
Lemma 5.10. Suppose that p(z1 , . . . , zm ) is real stable, that z ∈ Abp , and that δ > 0 satisfies
1
Φjp (z) ≤ 1 − .
δ

(14)

Then for all i,
Φip−∂z p (z + δej ) ≤ Φip (z).
j

Proof. We will write ∂i instead of ∂zi to ease notation. We begin by computing an expression
for Φip−∂j p in terms of Φjp , Φip , and ∂j Φip :
Φip−∂j p =

∂i (p − ∂j p)
p − ∂j p

∂i (1 − Φjp )p

as ∂i Φjp = ∂j Φip . We would like to show that Φip−∂j p (z + δej ) ≤ Φip (z). By the above identity
this is equivalent to
∂j Φip (z + δej )
≤ Φip (z) − Φip (z + δej ).
−
j
1 − Φp (z + δej )
By part (13) of Lemma 5.7,

δ · (−∂j Φip (z + δej )) ≤ Φip (z) − Φip (z + δej ).
Thus it is sufficient to establish that
−

∂j Φip (z + δej )
1 − Φjp (z + δej )

≤ δ · (−∂j Φip (z + δej )).

(15)

From part (12) of Lemma 5.7, we know that (−∂j Φip (z + δej )) ≥ 0; so, we may divide both
sides of (15) by this term to obtain
1
≤ δ.
1 − Φip (z + δej )

(16)

Applying Lemma 5.7 once more we observe that Φjp (z + δej ) ≤ Φjp (z), and conclude that (16) is
implied by
1
≤ δ,
1 − Φjp (z)

which is implied by (14).

We now have the necessary tools to prove the main theorem of this section.
Proof of Theorem 5.1. Let

By Theorem 3.11,
ΦiP (y1 , . . . , ym ) =

Note that Pm = Q.
Set x0 to be the all-t vector, and for k ∈ [m] define xk to be the vector that is t + δ in the
first k coordinates and t in the rest. By inductively applying Lemmas 5.9 and 5.10, we prove
that xk is above the roots of Pk , and that for all i
ΦiPk (xk ) ≤ φ.
It follows that the largest root of
µ [A1 , . . . , Am ] (x) = Pm (x, . . . , x)

The expected characteristic polynomial of the i vi vi∗ is the mixed characteristic polynomial

For i ∈ [m], let li be the size of the support of the random vector vi , and let vi take the
values wi,1 , . . . , wi,li with probabilities pi,1 , . . . , pi,li . Theorem 4.5 tells us that the polynomials

The Paving Conjecture

The main result of this section is the following quantitative version of Conjecture 1.3. Following [CEKP07], we will say that a square matrix T can be (r, ǫ)-paved if there are coordinate
projections P1 , . . . , Pr such that ri=1 Pi = I and Pi T Pi ≤ ǫ T for all i.
Theorem 6.1. For every ǫ > 0, every zero-diagonal complex self-adjoint matrix T can be
(r, ǫ)−paved with r = (6/ǫ)4 .
To prove this theorem, we rely on the following result of Casazza et al. which says that
paving arbitrary self-adjoint matrices can be reduced to paving certain projection matrices. Its
short proof is based on elementary linear algebra.
Lemma 6.2 (Theorem 3 of [CEKP07]). Suppose there is a function r : R+ → N so that every
2n × 2n projection matrix Q with diagonal entries equal to 1/2 can be (r(ǫ), 1+ǫ
2 )-paved for all
ǫ > 0. Then every n × n self-adjoint zero-diagonal matrix T can be (r 2 (ǫ), ǫ)-paved for all ǫ > 0.
Proof of Theorem 6.1. Let Q be an arbitrary 2n × 2n projection matrix with diagonal entries
equal to 1/2. Then Q = (u∗i uj )i,j∈[2n] is the gram matrix of 2n vectors u1 , . . . , u2n ∈ Cn with
ui 2 = 1/2 = δ. Applying Corollary 1.5 to these vectors for any r yields a partition S1 , . . . , Sr
of [2n]. Letting Pk be the projection onto the indices in Sk , we have for each k ∈ [r]:
Pk QPk = (u∗i uj )i,j∈Sk =
i∈Sk

ui ui ∗ ≤

√ +√
r

<

3
+√ .
2
r

(17)

2
Thus every Q can be (r, 1+ǫ
2 )−paved for r = 36/ǫ . Applying Lemma 6.2 yields Theorem 6.1.

It is well-known that Theorem 6.1 can be extended to arbitrary matrices T with zero diagonal
at the cost of a further quadratic loss in parameters: simply decompose T = A + iB for selfadjoint zero-diagonal matrices A, B, and take a product of pavings of A and B.
We have not made any attempt to optimize the dependence of r on ǫ in Theorem 6.1, and
leave this as an open question. It is known [CEKP07] that it is not possible to do better than
r = 1/ǫ2 .

Conclusion

When m = d, the constant coefficient of the mixed characteristic polynomial of A1 , . . . , Ad is the
mixed discriminant of A1 , . . . , Ad . The mixed discriminant has many definitions, among them
d

∂zi

D(A1 , . . . , Ad ) =
i=1

zi Ai

det

.

i

See [Gur06] or [BR97].
When k < d, we define
D(A1 , . . . , Ak ) = D(A1 , . . . , Ak , I, . . . , I)/(d − k)!,
17

where the identity matrix I is repeated d − k times. For example D(A1 ) is the just the trace of
A1 .
With this notation, we can write
d

xd−k (−1)k

µ [A1 , . . . , Am ] (x) =
k=0

D((Ai )i∈S ).
S∈([m]
k )

When the matrices A1 , . . . , Ad are diagonal, µ [A1 , . . . , Ad ] (x) is the matching polynomial
defined by Heilmann and Lieb [HL72] of the bipartite graph with d vertices on each side in which
the edge (i, j) has weight Ai (j, j). When all the matrices have the same trace and their sum is
the identity, the graph is regular and our bound on the largest root of the mixed characteristic
polynomial agrees to the first order with that obtained for the matching polynomial by Heilmann
and Lieb [HL72].
We conjecture that among the families of matrices A1 , . . . , Am with i Ai = I and Tr (Ai ) ≤
ǫ, the largest root of the mixed characteristic polynomial is maximized when as many of the
matrices as possible equal ǫI/d, another is a smaller multiple of the identity, and the rest are zero.
When all of the matrices have the same trace, d/m, this produces a scaled associated Laguerre
polynomial Lm−d
(mx). The bound that we prove on the largest root of the mixed characteristic
d
polynomial agrees asymptotically with the largest root of Lm−d
(mx) as d/m is held constant
d
and d grows. Evidence for our conjecture may be found in the work of Gurvits [Gur06, Gur08],
who proves that when m = d, the constant term of the mixed polynomial is minimized when
each Ai equals I/d.
Two natural questions arise from our work. The first is whether one can design an efficient
algorithm to find the partitions and pavings that are guaranteed to exist by Corollary 1.5. The
second is broader. There are many operations that are known to preserve real stability and real
rootedness of polynomials (see [LS81, BB10, BB09a, BB09b, Pem12, Wag11]). For a technique
like the “method of characteristic polynomials” it would be useful to understand what these
operations do to the roots and the coefficients of the polynomials.
