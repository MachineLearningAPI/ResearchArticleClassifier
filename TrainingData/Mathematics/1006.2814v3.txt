Abstract
The Hirsch Conjecture (1957) stated that the graph of a d-dimensional
polytope with n facets cannot have (combinatorial) diameter greater than
n − d. That is, that any two vertices of the polytope can be connected by
a path of at most n − d edges.
This paper presents the first counterexample to the conjecture. Our
polytope has dimension 43 and 86 facets. It is obtained from a 5-dimensional polytope with 48 facets which violates a certain generalization of
the d-step conjecture of Klee and Walkup.

Introduction

The Hirsch conjecture is the following fundamental statement about the combinatorics of polytopes. It was stated by Warren M. Hirsch in 1957 in the context
of the simplex method, and publicized by G. Dantzig in his 1963 monograph on
linear programming [11]:
The (combinatorial) diameter of a polytope of dimension d with n
facets cannot be greater than n − d.
Here we call combinatorial diameter of a polytope the maximum number of
steps needed to go from one vertex to another, where a step consists in traversing
an edge. Since we never refer to any other diameter in this paper, we will often
omit the word “combinatorial”. We say that a polytope is Hirsch if it satisfies
the conjecture, and non-Hirsch if it does not.
Our main result (Corollary 1.7) is the construction of a 43-dimensional polytope with 86 facets and diameter (at least) 44. Via products and glueing copies
of it we can also construct an infinite family of polytopes in fixed dimension d
with increasing number n of facets and of diameter bigger than (1 + )n, for a
positive constant (Theorem 1.8).

† I met Vic Klee only once, when I visited the University of Washington to give a seminar
talk. Although he was retired—he was already 76 years old—he came to the Department of
Mathematics to talk to me and we had a nice conversation during which he asked me “Why
don’t you try to disprove the Hirsch Conjecture?” This work is the answer to that question.

Linear programming, the simplex method and the Hirsch
Conjecture
Linear programming (LP) is the problem of maximizing (or minimizing) a linear functional subject to linear inequality constraints. For more than 30 years
the only applicable method for LP was the simplex method, devised in 1947 by
G. Dantzig [10]. This method solves a linear program by first finding a vertex of
the feasibility region P , which is a facet-defined polyhedron, and then jumping
from vertex to neighboring vertex along the edges of P , always increasing the
functional to be maximized. When such a pivot step can no longer increase the
functional, convexity guarantees that we are at the global maximum. (A pivot
rule has to be specified for the algorithm to choose among the possible neighboring vertices; the performance of the algorithm may depend on the choice).
To this day, the complexity of the simplex method is quite a mystery: exponential (or almost) worst-case behavior of the method is known for most of the
pivot rules practically used or theoretically proposed. (For two recent breakthrough additions see [16, 17]). But on the other hand, as M. Todd recently put
it, “the number of steps [that the simplex method takes] to solve a problem with m
equality constraints in n nonnegative variables is almost always at most a small
multiple of m, say 3m” [44]. Because of this “the simplex method has remained,
if not the method of choice, a method of choice, usually competitive with, and on
some classes of problems superior to, the more modern approaches” [44]. This
is so even after the discovery, 30 years ago, of polynomial time algorithms for
linear programming by Khachiyan and Karmarkar [26, 21]. In fact, in the year
2000 the simplex method was selected as one of the “10 algorithms with the
greatest influence on the development and practice of science and engineering
in the 20th century” by the journal Computing in Science and Engineering [13].
It is also worth mentioning that Khachiyan and Karmarkar’s algorithms are
polynomial in the bit model of complexity but they are not polynomial in the
real number machine model of Blum et al. [5, 6]. Algorithms that are polynomial
in both models are called strongly polynomial. S. Smale [40] listed among his
“mathematical problems for the next century” the question whether linear programming can be performed in strongly polynomial time. A polynomial pivot
rule for the simplex method would answer this in the affirmative.
For information on algorithms for linear programming and their complexity,
including attempts to explain the good behavior of the simplex method without
relying on bounds for the diameters of all polytopes, see [7, 19, 37, 41, 42].

Brief history of the Hirsch conjecture
Warren M. Hirsch (1918–2007), a professor of probability at the Courant Institute, communicated his conjecture to G. Dantzig in connection to the simplex
method: the diameter of a polytope is a lower bound (and, hopefully, an approximation) to the number of steps taken by the simplex method in the worst-case.
Hirsch had verified the conjecture for n − d ≤ 4 and Dantzig included this
statement and the conjecture in his 1963 book [11, p. 160].
The original conjecture did not distinguish between bounded or unbounded
feasibility regions. In modern terminology, a bounded one is a (convex) polytope
while a perhaps-unbounded one is a polyhedron. But the unbounded case was
disproved by Klee and Walkup [34] in 1967 with the construction of a polyhedron

2

of dimension 4 with 8 facets and diameter 5. Since then the expression “Hirsch
Conjecture” has been used referring to the bounded case.
In the same paper, Klee and Walkup established the following crucial statement. See a proof in Section 2:
Lemma 1.1 (Klee, Walkup [34]). For positive integers n > d, let H(n, d) denote
the maximum possible diameter of the graph of a d-polytope with n facets. Then,
H(n, d) ≤ H(2n − 2d, n − d). Put differently:
∀m ∈ N,

max{H(d + m, d)} = H(2m, m).
d∈N

Corollary 1.2 (d-step Theorem, Klee-Walkup [34, Theorem 2.5]). The following statements are equivalent:
1. H(n, d) ≤ n − d for all n and d.

(Hirsch Conjecture)

2. H(2d, d) ≤ d for all d.

(d-step Conjecture)

The Hirsch conjecture holds for n ≤ d + 6: Klee and Walkup proved the
d-step conjecture for d ≤ 5, and the case d = 6 has recently been verified by
Bremner and Schewe [9]. In a previous paper [31], Klee had shown the Hirsch
conjecture for d = 3. Together with the cases (n, d) ∈ {(11, 4), (12, 4)} [8, 9],
these are all the parameters where the Hirsch conjecture is known to hold.
The best upper bounds we have for H(n, d) in general are a quasi-polynomial
one by Kalai and Kleitman [25] and one linear in fixed dimension proved by
Barnette and improved by Larman and then Barnette again [1, 3, 35]. These
bounds take the following form (the second one assumes d ≥ 3):
H(n, d) ≤ nlog2 (d)+1 ,

H(n, d) ≤

2d−2
n.
3

In particular, no polynomial upper bound is known. Its existence is dubbed
the polynomial Hirsch conjecture:
Conjecture 1.3 (Polynomial Hirsch Conjecture). There is a polynomial f (n)
such that the diameter of every polytope with n facets is bounded above by f (n).
Of course, apart of its central role in polytope theory, the significance of this
conjecture is that polynomial pivot rules cannot exist for the simplex method
unless it holds. For more information on these and other results see the chapter
that Klee wrote in Gr¨
unbaum’s book [32], and the survey papers [27, 33].

Our counterexample
The d-step Theorem stated above implies that to prove or disprove the Hirsch
conjecture there is no loss of generality in assuming n = 2d. A second reduction
is that, for every n and d, the maximum of H(n, d) is always achieved at a simple
polytope (a d-polytope in which every vertex belongs to exactly d facets). Simple
polytopes are especially relevant for linear programming: they are obtained
when the system of inequalities is sufficiently generic.
The first ingredient in our proof is the observation that if we start with
a polytope which is at the same time non-simple and has n > 2d, then the

3

techniques used in these two reductions can be combined to get a simple (n−d)polytope with 2n − 2d facets and not only maintain its diameter (or, to be
more precise, the distance between two distinguished non-simple vertices), but
actually increase it. We call this the Strong d-step Theorem and prove it in
Section 2. Although the theorem can be stated more generally (see Remark 2.7),
the version we need has to do with the following class of polytopes:
Definition 1.4. A d-spindle is a d-polytope P having two distinguished vertices
u and v such that every facet of P contains exactly one of them. See Figure 1.
The length of a spindle is the graph distance between u and v.
Equivalently, a spindle is the intersection of two polyhedral convex cones with
apices at u and v and with both their interiors containing the open segment uv.

Theorem 1.5 (Strong d-step Theorem for spindles). If P is a spindle of dimension d, with n facets and length l, then there is another spindle P of dimension
n − d, with 2n − 2d facets and with length at least l + n − 2d. In particular, if
l > d then P violates the d-step conjecture, hence also the Hirsch conjecture.
The second ingredient in our disproof is the explicit construction of a spindle
of dimension five and length six, that we describe in Section 3:
Theorem 1.6. There is a 5-dimensional spindle (with 48 facets and 322 vertices) of length six.
That our spindle has length six is easy to verify computationally. Still, we
include two computer-free proofs in Sections 4 and 5. Putting Theorems 1.5
and 1.6 together we get:
Corollary 1.7. There is a non-Hirsch polytope of dimension 43 with 86 facets.
4

Section 6 is devoted to show how to derive an infinite family of non-Hirsch
polytopes from the first one:
Theorem 1.8. There is a fixed dimension d, a positive > 0, and an infinite
family of d-polytopes Pk each with nk facets and with diameter bigger than (1 +
)nk .
For example, from the non-Hirsch polytope in this paper we get
1/86
in dimension 86 and
1/43 in high d. With the one announced in [36] (see
Theorem 1.12 below) one gets
1/40 in dimension 40 and
1/20 in high d.

Discussion
Our counterexample disproves as a by-product the following two statements,
originally posed in the hope of shedding light on the Hirsch conjecture:
1. Provan and Billera [38] introduced the hierarchy of k-decomposable simplicial complexes: k-decomposability is stronger than (k+1)-decomposability
for every k and the boundary of every simplicial d-polytope is (d − 1)decomposable (or shellable). They also showed that 0-decomposable (or
vertex decomposable) complexes satisfy (the polar of) the Hirsch conjecture. Non-vertex-decomposable polytopes were previously found by
Kleinschmidt [33, p. 742], but it would be interesting to explore whether
our non-Hirsch polytope, besides not being 0-decomposable, fails also to
be 1-decomposable (or higher).
2. Todd [43] showed that from any unbounded non-Hirsch polyhedron, such
as the one previously found by Klee and Walkup, one can easily obtain
a counterexample to the so-called monotone Hirsch conjecture. Still, the
strict monotone Hirsch conjecture of Ziegler [45], stronger than the Hirsch
conjecture, was open.
Still, our techniques leave the underlying problem–how large can the diameter of a polytope be–almost as open as it was before. In particular, we cannot
answer the following question:
Question 1.9. Is there a constant c (independent of d) such that the diameter
of every d-polytope with n facets is bounded above by cn?
We suspect the answer to be negative, but our lack of knowledge somehow
confirms the following sentence from [33]: Finding a counterexample will be
merely a small first step in the line of investigation related to the conjecture.
Another “small step” has recently been given by F. Eisenbrand, N. H¨ahnle,
A. Razborov, and T. Rothvoß [14], with the introduction of certain abstract
generalizations of boundary complexes of polyhedra and the construction of
objects of super-linear diameter in this generalized setting. By further analyzing
this setting, N. H¨
ahnle has posed the following tempting and more explicit
version of Conjecture 1.3:
Conjecture 1.10 ([22]). The diameter of every d-polytope with n facets is
bounded above by dn.
Thanks to Remark 6.4 this conjecture is (almost) equivalent to:
5

Conjecture 1.11. The diameter of every d-polytope with n facets is bounded
above by d(n − d).
To finish, let us mention two additional results that were obtained after the
first version of this paper was made public: On the one hand, relying on the
reductions that we introduce in Section 5.1, Santos, Stephen and Thomas [39]
have shown that all 4-spindles have length at most 4 [39]. Hence, spindles of
dimension five are truly needed to obtain non-Hirsch polytopes via Theorem 1.5.
On the other hand, Matschke, Santos and Weibel [36] have constructed a 5spindle of length 6 with only 25 facets, from which Theorem 1.6 gives:
Theorem 1.12 (Matschke, Santos, Weibel [36]). There is a non-Hirsch polytope
of dimension 20 with 40 facets and 36 442 vertices. It has diameter 21.
Apart of the decrease in dimension, the smaller size of this example has
allowed us to explicitly compute coordinates for the non-Hirsch polytope in
question. Doing the same with the 43-dimensional example presented in this
paper seemed out of reach. We would need to apply 38 times the operation of
wedge followed by perturbation in the proof of Theorem 1.5 (see Section 2.2).
Julian Pfeifle (personal communication) wrote a small program to automatically
do this and, using a standard desktop computer with 2GB of RAM, was able to
undertake the first nine iterations. Experimentally, he found that each iteration
more or less doubled the number of vertices (and multiplied by four or five the
computation time) indicating that the final non-Hirsch polytope has about 240
vertices. To make things worse, the tower of 38 perturbations would give rise to
either huge rational coefficients or very delicate numerical approximation issues.

A strong d-step theorem for spindles

We find it easier to work in a polar setting in which we want to travel from facet
to facet of a polytope Q crossing ridges (codimension-2 faces), rather than travel
from vertex to vertex along edges. That is, we are interested in the following
dual version of the Hirsch conjecture:
Definition 2.1. A d-polytope Q with n vertices is a dual-Hirsch polytope if
n − d dual steps suffice to travel from any facet of Q to any other facet. A dual
step consists in moving from one facet F of Q to an adjacent one F , meaning
by this that F and F share a ridge of Q.
Clearly, Q is dual-Hirsch if and only if its polar polytope is Hirsch. In the
rest of the paper we omit the word dual from our dual paths and dual steps.

2.1

Two classical reductions

It is known since the 60’s that to prove or disprove the (dual) Hirsch conjecture it is enough to look at simplicial polytopes with twice as many vertices as
their dimension. Since our strong d-step theorem is based in combining both
reductions, let us see how they work.
For the first reduction, following Klee [29, 30] we use the operation of pushing
vertices. Let Q be a polytope with vertices V and let v ∈ V be one of them.
We say that a polytope Q is obtained from Q by pushing v if the vertices of Q
6

are V \ {v} ∪ {v } for a certain point v ∈ Q and the only hyperplanes spanned
by vertices of Q that intersect the segment vv are those containing v. Put
differently, the vertex v is pushed to a new position v within the polytope Q
but sufficiently close to its original position. We emphasize that we admit v to
be in the boundary of Q. In the standard notion of pushing, v is required to
be in the interior of Q.
Lemma 2.2. Let Q be obtained from Q by pushing v. Then:
1. Let F be a facet of Q with vertex set S and let S = S \ {v } ∪ {v} or
S = S depending on whether v ∈ F or not. Then, there is a unique facet
φ(F ) of Q such that S ⊂ φ(F ).
2. The map F → φ(F ) sends adjacent facets of Q to either the same or
adjacent facets of Q. (That is, φ is a simplicial map between the dual
graphs of Q and Q).
Proof. For part (1), consider what happens when we continuously move v to
its original position v along the segment vv . We call Q(t), F (t), S(t) and v(t)
the polytope, facet, vertex set, and vertex obtained at moment t, with v = v(1)
and v = v(0). The assumption that no hyperplane spanned by vertices of Q
intersects vv unless it contains v implies that the combinatorics of Q(t) remains
the same at every moment t > 0; changes will happen only at t = 0. Now, every
facet-defining hyperplane of Q(t) will tend to a facet-defining hyperplane of Q(0)
(which implies part (1)) unless the vertex set S(t) spanning a certain facet F (t)
collapses to lie in a flat of codimension two. Put differently, unless F (t) is a
pyramid with apex at v(t) over a codimension two face G of Q with v in the
affine span of G . We claim that the assumption v ∈ Q rules out this possibility.
Indeed, in this situation the hyperplane H spanned by F (t) is independent of
t for t > 0 and it contains the segment vv . Let w be the last point where the
ray from v through v meets Q. Then, w is a convex combination of vertices of
Q different from v and it lies in the hyperplane H , so it lies in the facet F (t)
for every t > 0. Since w is further from G than v(t), F (t) cannot be a pyramid
with apex at v(t) and base G .
For part (2) we reinterpret (the proof of) part (1) as saying: when t goes
from 1 to 0 the combinatorics of Q remains the same except that at t = 0 some
groups of facets of Q merge to single facets of Q. This implies the claim.
Corollary 2.3 (Klee [29]). For every polytope Q there is a simplicial polytope
Q of the same dimension and number of vertices and with the same or greater
dual diameter.
For the next lemma, and for the proof of Theorem 2.6 we introduce the
one-point-suspension. For a given vertex v of a d-polytope Q with n vertices,
the one-point-suspension Sv (Q) is constructed embedding Q in a hyperplane in
Rd+1 and adding two new vertices u and w on opposite sides of that hyperplane
and such that the segment uw contains v. This makes Sv (Q) have dimension
d + 1 and n + 1 vertices (we added two, but v is no longer a vertex). The facets
of Sv (Q) are of two types:
Sv (F ),
F ∗ u and F ∗ w,

for each facet F of Q with v ∈ F , and
for each facet F of Q with v ∈ F .
7

In this formula, F ∗ u denotes the pyramid over F with apex at u. See [12] or
[28] for more details, and Figure 2 for an illustration. One-point-suspensions
appear in the literature also under other names, such as dual wedges or vertex
splittings.

Figure 2: The one-point-suspension of a pentagon is a simplicial 3-polytope with
six vertices and eight facets

Lemma 2.4. Let F1 and F2 be two facets of a polytope Q and let Q := Sv (Q)
for some vertex v. For i = 1, 2, let Fi ≤ Q denote the facet Sv (Fi ) if v ∈ Fi or
one of the facets Fi ∗ u or Fi ∗ w if v ∈ Fi . Then, the distance between F1 and
F2 in the dual graph of Q is greater or equal than the distance between F1 and
F2 in the dual graph of Q.
Proof. The dual graph of Q projects down to that of Q by sending each facet
Sv (F ), F ∗u or F ∗w to the facet F of Q that it came from. Graph-theoretically,
this projection amounts to contracting all the dual edges between F ∗u and F ∗w,
for each facet F ≤ Q not containing v.
Proof of Lemma 1.1. We prove that H(n, d) ≤ H(2n − 2d, n − d) by induction
on |n − d| and separating the cases n > 2d and n < 2d: If n < 2d then every
pair u, v of vertices of a d-polytope P with n facets lie in some common facet
F . F is a polytope of dimension d − 1 with at most n − 1 facets so the distance
from u to v in F is bounded by H(n − 1, d − 1). If n > 2d, apply Lemma 2.4
to a d-polytope Q with n vertices whose dual diameter achieves H(n, d), to get
H(n, d) ≤ H(n + 1, d + 1).

2.2

The strong d-step Theorem

The following class of polytopes are the polars of the spindles mentioned in
Theorem 1.5:
Definition 2.5. A prismatoid is a polytope having two parallel facets Q+ and
Q− that contain all vertices. We call Q+ and Q− the base facets of Q. The
width of a prismatoid is the dual graph distance between Q+ and Q− .
The “base facets” of a prismatoid may not be unique, but they are part
of the definition. For example, a cube or an octahedron are prismatoids with
respect to any of their pairs of opposite facets. Observe that the requirement of
Q+ and Q− to be parallel is not especially relevant, as long as they are disjoint.

8

If Q+ and Q− are disjoint facets of an arbitrary polytope Q then a projective
transformation can make them parallel without changing the combinatorics of
Q (see, e. g., [45, p. 69]). The following statement is equivalent to Theorem 1.5:
Theorem 2.6 (Strong d-step Theorem for prismatoids). If Q is a prismatoid
of dimension d with n vertices and width l, then there is another prismatoid
Q of dimension n − d, with 2n − 2d vertices and width at least l + n − 2d. In
particular, if l > d then Q violates the (dual) d-step conjecture, hence also the
(dual) Hirsch conjecture.
Proof. We call the number s = n − 2d the asimpliciality of Q and prove the
theorem by induction on s. Since every facet of a d-polytope has at least d
vertices, s is always non-negative. The base case of s = 0 is tautological. For
the inductive step, we show that if s > 0 we can construct from Q a new
prismatoid Q with dimension one higher, one vertex more (in particular, the
“asimpliciality” has decreased by one), and width at least one more than Q.
Since s > 0, at least one of Q+ and Q− , say Q+ , is not a simplex (the
other one, Q− , may or may not be a simplex). Let v be a vertex of Q− , and
let Sv (Q) be the one-point-suspension of Q over v. Let Q− = Sv (Q− ) be the
one-point-suspension of Q− , which appears as a facet of Sv (Q). Observe that
Sv (Q) is almost a prismatoid: its faces Q− and Q+ contain all vertices and they
lie in two parallel hyperplanes. The only problem is that Q+ is not a facet,
it is a ridge; but since we know that Q+ is not a simplex, moving its vertices
slightly in the direction of the segment uw creates a new facet Q+ parallel to
Q− , and these two facets contain all the vertices of the new polytope, that we
denote Q and is a prismatoid. (In fact, moving a single vertex of Q+ is enough
to achieve this). See Figure 3 for an illustration. In the figure, we draw several
points along the edge Q+ to convey the fact that Q+ is not a simplex; these
points have to be understood as vertices of Q.
By Lemma 2.4, the distance from Q− to any of Q+ ∗ u and Q+ ∗ w in Sv (Q)
is (at least) l. To make sure that the width of Q is at least l + 1 we do the
perturbation from Sv (Q) to Q in the following special manner: let a be a vertex
of Q+ and assume that the only non-simplicial facets of Sv (Q) containing a are
Q+ ∗ u and Q+ ∗ w (if that is not the case, we first push a to a point in the
interior of Q+ but otherwise generic, which maintains all the properties we need
and does not decrease the dual distances, by Lemma 2.2). We now get Q by
moving only a, in a direction parallel to Q− and away from Q+ , to a position
a . Then Q+ will be replaced by a pyramid Q+ := conv(vertices(Q+ ) \ a) ∗ a .
The genericity assumption on a implies that apart from the creation of Q+ ,
the only change to the face lattice of Sv (Q) is that the two facets Q+ ∗ u and
Q+ ∗ w get refined as two complexes U ∗ u and W ∗ w where U and W are the
lower and upper envelopes of the facet Q+ (here we are considering the direction
uw as vertical, with w above u). The width of Q is at least l + 1 since in order
to get out of Q+ the first step will send us to a facet in either U ∗ u or W ∗ w,
and that facet is at least at the same distance from Q− as Q+ ∗ u or Q+ ∗ w
were, by the same arguments as in the proof of Lemma 2.2.
Remark 2.7. The following version of the strong d-step theorem is also true,
with essentially the same proof: Let Q be a d-polytope with n vertices and
containing two disjoint facets Q+ and Q− that use in total m of the vertices,

to be vertices of it, and convey the hypothesis that Q+ is not a simplex

for some m > 2d. Let l be the dual graph distance from Q+ to Q− . Then, there
is a (m − d)-polytope Q with n + m − 2d vertices and having two facets Q+
and Q− at distance l + m − 2d. In particular, if l > (n − m) + d then Q is
non-Hirsch. The prismatoid version is the case n = m.

A 5-prismatoid without the d-step property

In the light of Theorem 2.6, we say that a prismatoid has the d-step property
if its width does not exceed its dimension. It is an easy exercise to show that
every 3-dimensional prismatoid has this property. For 4-dimensional ones, the
result is still true is true, although not obvious anymore [39]. In dimension five,
however, we have the following statement, which implies Theorem 1.6:
Theorem 3.1. The 5-dimensional prismatoid with the 48 rows of the matrices
of Table 1 as vertices has width six.
Q is small enough for the statement of Theorem 3.1 to be verified computationally, which has been done independently by Edward D. Kim and Julian
Pfeifle with the software polymake [18]. Still, in sections 4 and 5 we give two
computer-free (but not “computation-free”) proofs. Before going into details
we list some properties of Q which follow directly from its definition:

Table 1: The 48 vertices of a 5-prismatoid without the d-step property
• The first 24 vertices (labeled 1 + to 24 + ) and the last 24 vertices (labeled
1 − to 24 − ) span two facets of Q, that we denote Q+ and Q− , lying in the
hyperplanes {x5 = +1} and {x5 = −1}. Hence, Q is indeed a prismatoid.
• Q is symmetric under the orthogonal transformation (x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 , x5 ) →
(x4 , x3 , x1 , x2 , −x5 ), and this symmetry sends Q+ to Q− , with the vertex
labeled i + going to the one labeled i − . (Observe, however, that this
symmetry is not an involution).
• Q+ and Q− (hence also Q) are themselves invariant under any of the
following 32 orthogonal transformations:

That is, they are symmetric under changing the sign of any of the first

the index-two subgroup that preserves Q+ and Q− .

First proof of Theorem 3.1

The first proof of Theorem 3.1 goes by explicitly describing the adjacency graph
between orbits of facets of Q which, thanks to symmetry, is not too difficult:
Theorem 4.1.
1. The 2 + 20 × 16 = 322 inequalities of Table 2 define facets
of Q. A and L are the bases of the prismatoid. Among the rest, the
32 labeled with the same letter form a Σ+ -orbit. There are six Σ-orbits,
obtained as the Σ+ -orbit unions A ∪ L, B ∪ K, C ∪ J, D ∪ I, E ∪ H, and
F ∪ G.

Figure 4: The adjacencies between facets of Q, modulo symmetry. Dashed
lines separate facets according to their bidimension. We say that a facet has
bidimension (i, j) if it is the convex hull of an i-face of Q+ and a j-face of Q− .
The empty face is considered to have dimension −1

Part 3 implies Theorem 3.1: in Figure 4 it is clear that six steps are necessary
(and sufficient) to go from the facet Q+ to the facet Q− (labeled A and L).
Proof of Theorem 4.1. In part one, the assertions about Σ and Σ+ -orbits are
straightforward, from the aspect of the inequalities. To check that these 322
inequalities define facets, we need to consider a single representative from each
Σ-orbit. For the base facets this is obvious, and for the rest we choose the
following representatives:

We leave it to the reader to check that these five inequalities are satisfied on
all 48 vertices of Q, and with equality precisely in the vertices listed for each in
Table 3. This task is not as hard as it seems since only the vertices with nonnegative coordinates x1 , x2 , x3 and x4 need to be checked (there are sixteen of
them). The five matrices have rank five, which shows that the vertices in each
of them span at least an affine hyperplane. Hence, they all define facets of Q.
For parts 2 and 3 we look more closely at the matrices in Table 3 and observe
that:
• The facets of types D, E and F are simplices, since they have five vertices:
three in Q+ and two in Q− or vice-versa.
• The facets of type C are iterated pyramids, with two apices in Q− , over
a quadrilateral in Q+ . Indeed, the vertices 9 + , 13 + , 17 + and 21 + form
a planar quadrilateral, since
2v9 + + 4v13 + = 3v17 + + 3v21 + .

With this information, we can prove parts 2 and 3 together by simply constructing the dual graph, that is, by looking at adjacencies between facets. The
simplices of types D, E and F need to have five neighboring facets, the double
pyramid of type C needs six, and the pyramid over a triangular prism needs
six too. So, it suffices to check the following adjecencies, which can be done by
tracking the vertices in the five representative facets and the permutations of

Second proof of Theorem 3.1

The second proof of Theorem 3.1 reduces the study of the combinatorics of
d-prismatoids to that of pairs of geodesic maps in the (d − 2)-sphere.

5.1

From prismatoids to pairs of geodesic maps

The intersection of a prismatoid with an intermediate hyperplane equals the
Minkowski sum Q+ + Q− of its two bases. More precisely:
Proposition 5.1. If Q is a prismatoid with base facets Q+ and Q− and H is
an intermediate hyperplane parallel to Q+ and Q− then
Q ∩ H = λ1 Q+ + λ2 Q− ,
where λ1 +λ2 = 1 and λ1 : λ2 = dist(H, Q+ ) : dist(H, Q− ) (the ratio of distances
from H to Q+ and Q− ).
Every face F (facet or not) of a Minkowski sum Q+ + Q− decomposes
uniquely as a sum F + + F − of faces of Q+ and Q− . We call bi-dimension
of F the pair (dim(F + ), dim(F − )). Proposition 5.1 implies that every facet of
Q other than the two bases induces a facet in the Minkowski sum Q+ + Q− .
More precisely, the dual graph of Q+ + Q− equals the dual graph of Q with the
two base facets removed. Since the facets of Q+ + Q− corresponding to facets
of Q adjacent to Q+ (respectively, to Q− ) are those of bi-dimension (d − 1, ∗)
(respectively, (∗, d − 1)), the d-step property for Q translates to the following
property for the pair of polytopes (Q+ , Q− ):
Definition 5.2. Let Q+ and Q− be two polytopes of dimension d − 1 with the
same or parallel affine spans. The pair (Q+ , Q− ) has the d-step property if
there is a sequence F1 , F2 , . . . , Fk of facets of Q+ + Q− , with k ≤ d − 1, such
that:
• The bi-dimension of F1 and the bi-dimension of Fk are (d − 1, ∗) and
(∗, d − 1).
• Fi is adjacent to Fi+1 for all i.
That is to say, we ask whether we can go from an F to an F in d − 2 steps,
where F and F are facets of Q+ + Q− of a special type.
Proposition 5.3. A prismatoid with base facets Q+ and Q− has the d-step
property if, and only if, the pair (Q+ , Q− ) has the d-step property.
The good thing about Proposition 5.3 is that it reduces the dimension by one.
In order to study our prismatoid of dimension five we only need to understand its
two bases, of dimension four. Before doing this let us make one more translation,
to the language of normal fans or normal maps.
The normal cone of a face F of a polytope P ⊂ Rd is the set of linear
functionals
{φ ∈ (Rd )∗ : φ|F is constant and max φ(p) = max φ(p)}.
p∈P

16

p∈F

The normal cones of faces of P form a complex N (P ) of polyhedral cones called
the normal fan of P . We call the intersection of this fan with the unit sphere the
normal map of P . (This is called the gaussian map of P in [15]. Incidentally, the
reading of [15] was our initial inspiration for attempting to disprove the Hirsch
conjecture via prismatoids). The normal map of a d-polytope P is a polyhedral
complex of spherical polytopes decomposing S d−1 . We call such objects geodesic
maps. (A priori, a geodesic map may not be the normal map of any polytope).
The following definition and theorem translate Proposition 5.3 into the language of geodesic maps. Note that since our polytopes Q+ and Q− are meant
to be facets of a d-polytope, their normal maps lie in the sphere S d−2 .
Definition 5.4. Let G + and G − be two geodesic maps in the sphere S d−2 .
1. The common refinement of G + and G − is the geodesic map whose cells
are all the possible intersections of a cell of G + and a cell of G − .
2. The pair (G + , G − ) has the d-step property if the 1-skeleton of their common refinement contains a path of length at most d − 2 from a vertex of
G + to a vertex of G − .
Theorem 5.5. Let Q+ and Q− be two polytopes in Rd−1 , with normal maps
G + and G − . The pair (Q+ , Q− ) has the d-step property if and only if the pair
(G + , G − ) has the d-step property.
Using the formalism of geodesic maps, Santos, Stephen and Thomas [39]
have shown that 4-prismatoids have the d-step property. That is to say, they
show that if a pair of graphs is embedded in the 2-sphere it is always possible
to go from a vertex of one to a vertex of the other traversing at most two edges
of their common refinement. The following example, which can be understood
as a pair of geodesic maps in the flat torus, shows that the reason for this is not
“local”.
Example 5.6 (A pair of periodic maps in the plane without the d-step property). Figure 6 shows (portions of) two maps drawn in the plane, one with its
1-skeleton in black and the other in grey. They are meant to be periodic and
have the same symmetry group, vertex-transitive in both. The pair does not
have the d-step property. We cannot go in two steps from a vertex v of the
black map to a vertex of the grey map.

5.2

A pair of geodesic maps in S 3 without the d-step property

Let us now concentrate on the facet Q+ of our 5-dimensional prismatoid Q. In
the light of Proposition 5.3 we can think of Q+ as lying in R4 , and omit its last
coordinate.
Lemma 5.7. Q+ has 32 facets, given by the following inequalities:
±5x1 ± x2 ± 2x3 ± x4 ≤ 90,
±x1 ± 5x2 ± x3 ± 2x4 ≤ 90.
The symmetry group Σ+ of Q+ acts transitively on them.

2nd step

Figure 6: A pair of periodic maps in the plane without the d-step property

Observe that Lemma 5.7 describes Q+ as the intersection of two crosspolytopes, so its polar is the common convex hull of two combinatorial 4-cubes.
This partially explains why this polar is a cubical polytope (see Remark 5.8
below).
Proof. That Σ+ acts transitively on these inequalities is clear from the form of
them and the description of Σ+ in Section 3. Symmetry has the consequence
that in order to prove that all the inequalities define facets we just need to
consider one of them. Take for instance:
5x1 + x2 + 2x3 + x4 ≤ 90.
Direct inspection shows that the inequality is valid on the 24 vertices of Q+ ,
and that it is met with equality precisely in the following six:

Since the top 4 × 4 submatrix is regular, these six points span the affine hyperplane 5x1 + x2 + 2x3 + x4 = 90, hence they define a facet F .
We still need to check that there are no other facets apart from the 32 in the
statement. For this consider the following equalities, in which vi+ represents
(the actual vector of coordinates of) the vertex labeled i+ :

point o = (−30, 0, 120, 0, 1), so that F is combinatorially a triangular prism, as

was shown in Figure 5. So, we only need to check that the five neighbors of F
are in our stated list of facets. This is true since:
• v5 + , v13 + , v17 + ∈ {−5x1 + x2 + 2x3 + x4 = 90} (x1 = 0 in these points).
• v1 + , v5 + , v13 + v21 + ∈ {5x1 − x2 + 2x3 + x4 = 90} (x2 = 0 in them).
• v1 + , v9 + , v21 + ∈ {5x1 + x2 − 2x3 + x4 = 90} (x3 = 0 in them).
• v1 + , v5 + , v9 + , v17 + ∈ {5x1 + x2 + 2x3 − x4 = 90} (x4 = 0 in them).
• v9 + , v13 + , v17 + , v21 + ∈ {x1 + 5x2 + x3 + 2x4 = 90}.

This description of the facets of Q+ translates nicely to the normal map G +
of Q+ . For the sake of having√nice integer coordinates, we consider this map as
lying in the sphere of radius 31 rather than radius 1 (but we still denote this
dilated sphere S 3 , for simplicity). That is, the vertices of G + are the following
points:
p±,±,±,± := (±5, ±1, ±2, ±1),

p±,±,±,± := (±1, ±5, ±1, ±2).

Observe they all lie in a torus {x21 + x22 = 26, x23 + x24 = 5}, which we denote
T + It is quite natural then to picture them on the flat torus. This is what
we do in Figure 7, where the horizontal and vertical coordinates represent the
angle along the circles {x21 + x22 = 26} and {x23 + x24 = 5}, respectively. The
grey dashed lines divide the torus into its sixteen octants. The 32 dots are the
vertices of G + , and the segments joining them represent its edges. Of course,
the true edges in S 3 do not go along T + . In particular, the crossings we see in
the picture are an artifact.
As seen in the matrix defining Q+ , there are five orbits of facets of G +
(i.e., vertices of Q+ ) modulo Σ+ . Representatives of them are, for example,
the normal cones of vertices 3 + , 7 + , 9 + , 13 + , and 22 + which we highlight in
Figure 8. The eight “vertical strips” in the orbits of cone(3 + ) and cone(9 + )
glue together to form a (polyhedral) solid torus subdivided into eight slices,
each of which is combinatorially a 3-cube. The eight horizontal strips form a
second solid torus. These two tori are glued along the sixteen diagonal edges
and eight of the vertical rectangles in the pictures, leaving eight empty regions
in between. These regions are filled in by the other eight cones, in the orbit of
cone(22 + ).
Remark 5.8. All the facets of G + are combinatorially equivalent to the 3-cube.
That is, Q+ is polar to a cubical polytope. In fact, it was communicated to us by
M. Joswig and G. Ziegler that the polar of Q+ is one of the neighborly cubical
polytopes (with the graph of the 5-cube) that they constructed in [24] and had
been previously found by Blind and Blind [4].
Now that we understand G + , let us draw the normal map G − of Q− , whose
vertices are (remember the symmetry that sends Q+ to Q− ):
(±1, ±2, ±5, ±1),

(±2, ±1, ±1, ±5).

Although these points lie in a different torus in S 3 than the vertices of G + ,
it is natural to draw them in the same flat torus (Figure 9). Basically, what

Figures 9 and 6.
Lemma 5.9.
1. Every vertex of G − lies in the interior of one of the four
+
facets of G of the orbit of cone(7 + ).
2. Similarly, every vertex of G + lies in the interior of one of the four facets
of G − of the orbit of cone(7 − ).
3. If v is a vertex of G + and C the facet of G − containing it, no vertex of C
lies in a facet of G + having v as a vertex.
Proof. Since both maps have the same symmetry group (the group Σ+ of the
previous section) and the group is transitive on the vertices, we only need to
prove the lemma for a single vertex v. We take v = (5, 1, 2, 1) and show that it
is contained in the interior of the facet cone(5 − ). By definition, the vertices of
G − on this facet are those satisfying the equation 45x1 = 90, that is, x1 = 2.
They are the eight vertices of the form:
(2, ±1, ±1, ±5).
Hence, the facet inequality description of cone(5 − ) is:
cone(5 − ) = {(p1 , p2 , p3 , p4 ) ∈ S 3 : ±2p2 ≤ p1 , ±2p3 ≤ p1 , ±2p4 ≤ 5p1 }.

Figure 8: Representatives of the five orbits of facets of G + .

The proof of part one (and two) finishes by noticing that (5, 1, 2, 1) satisfies
these six inequalities strictly.
For part three, we look at what facets of G + contain the vertices of cone(5 − ).
They have to be in the Σ+ -orbit of cone(7 + ) and the pictures (see Figure 10)
tell us that they are the facets cone(7 + ) and cone(8 + ), none of whose vertices
is the original v.
Part 3 of Lemma 5.9 is the key to finishing the proof of Theorem 3.1. In the
following statement we say that a pair (G + , G − ) of geodesic maps on S d−2 are
transversal if whenever respective cells C1 and C2 of them intersect we have
dim(C1 ) + dim(C2 ) = d − 2 + dim(C1 ∩ C2 ).
Proposition 5.10. Let (G + , G − ) be a transversal pair of geodesic maps in the
(d − 2)-sphere. If there is a path of length d − 2 between a vertex v1 of G + and
a vertex v2 of G − , then the facet of G − containing v1 in its interior has v2 as a
vertex and the facet of G + containing v2 in its interior has v1 as a vertex.
Proof. For every cell C1 ∩ C2 of the common refinement of G + and G − we call
(dim(C1 ), dim(C2 )) the bi-dimension of C1 ∩ C2 . Let v = C1 ∩ C2 be a vertex
incident to an edge e = D1 ∩ D2 . Transversality implies that if the bi-dimension
of v is (i, j), then the bi-dimension of e is one of (i + 1, j) or (i, j + 1). (The
former occurs if C1 ≤ D1 and C2 = D2 , and the latter if C1 = D1 and C2 ≤ D2 ).
As a consequence, the bi-dimension of the other end of e is one of (i + 1, j − 1),
(i, j) or (i − 1, j + 1). That is, bi-dimensions of consecutive vertices on a path
differ by at most one unit on each coordinate.
Since v1 and v2 have bi-dimensions (0, d − 2) and (d − 2, 0), along a path
of d − 2 steps connecting them the first coordinate of the bi-dimension always
21

Figure 9: The normal maps G + (dark) and G − (light), drawn on the same flat
torus

increases and the second coordinate always decreases. This means that we move
along a flag (a chain of cells each contained in the next) of G + , and at the end
we finish in a facet having v1 as a vertex. Similarly, the facet of G − where we
started has v2 as a vertex.
So, Theorem 3.1 follows from Lemma 5.9 and Proposition 5.10 if we show
that the pair (G + , G − ) we are dealing with is transversal. The pair being
transversal is equivalent to every proper face F of Q satisfying
dim(F ∩ Q+ ) + dim(F ∩ Q− ) = dim(F ) − 1.
This needs only be checked for facets, and was actually implicitly shown in
the description of the facets of Q given in Section 4 (see Figure 4, and the
proof of parts 2 and 3 of Theorem 4.1). Alternatively, this second proof can be

Figure 10: Proof of Lemma 5.9. The facet C of G + containing v1 (left) and the
two facets of G − containing the vertices of C (right)

22

finished with a perturbation argument: Even if (G + , G − ) was not transversal,
any sufficiently generic and sufficiently small rotation of one of the maps will
make the pair transversal without destroying the property stated in part 3 of
Lemma 5.9.

An infinite family of non-Hirsch polytopes

In this section we show general procedures to construct new non-Hirsch polytopes from old ones. All the techniques we use are quite standard. Our result
is that there is a fixed dimension d in which we can build an infinite sequence
of non-Hirsch polytopes with diameter exceeding the Hirsch bound by a fixed
fraction.
If we do not ask for a fixed dimension the result is straightforward (see,
e.g., [34, Prop. 1.3]):
Lemma 6.1. If P is a a d-polytope with n facets and with diameter (1+ )(n−d)
for a certain > 0 then the k-fold product P k is a kd-polytope with kn facets
and with diameter (1 + )(kn − kd).
In fixed dimension we use the following glueing lemma. It appears, for
example, in [23]:
Lemma 6.2. Let P1 and P2 be simple polytopes of the same dimension d, having
respectively n1 and n2 facets, and with diameters l1 and l2 . Then, there is a
simple d-polytope with n1 +n2 −d facets and with diameter at least l1 +l2 −1.
Corollary 6.3. If P is a simple d-polytope with n facets and diameter l, then
for each k there is a d-polytope Pk with k(n − d) + d facets and diameter at least
k(l − 1) + 1. In particular, if P is non-Hirsch then Pk is non-Hirsch as well.
Proof. By induction on k, applying Lemma 6.2 to Pk−1 and P1 := P . For the
second part, assume that P is non-Hirsch. That is, l ≥ n − d + 1. Then:
k(n − d) + d − d = k(n − d) ≤ k(l − 1),
so Pk is non-Hirsch as well.
Remark 6.4 (McMullen, personal communication). It is a consequence of
Corollary 6.3 that if there is a linear bound, say H(n, d) ≤ an + b, for the
diameters of polytopes of a fixed dimension d, then one has also the bound
H(n, d) ≤ a(n − d) + 1 (in the same dimension). Indeed, from a d-polytope
with n facets and diameter a(n − d) + 2 (or higher), the corollary above gives
d-polytopes in which the ratio of diameter to number of facets tends to (at least)
lim

k→∞

k(a(n − d) + 1) + 1

k(n − d) + d
n−d

As one referee pointed out to us, this remark is reminiscent of Lemma 2 in [2]:
let F1 (n, d) denote the maximum number of edges of all simplicial d-polytopes
with n vertices. If F1 (n, d) ≥ dn − b holds all n and d and some constant b, then
F1 (n, d) ≥ d(n − d) + d2 also holds.

23

It is a consequence of Corollary 6.3 (and a special case of the remark above)
that the dimensions for which Theorem 1.8 holds are those for which there is a
polytope violating the Hirsch bound by at least two. Lemma 6.1 implies that
this is the case for dimension 2d if there is a non-Hirsch d-polytope. To give a
more explicit statement, we call Hirsch excess (or simply excess) of a d-polytope
with n facets and diameter l the ratio
l
− 1.

Theorem 6.5. Let P be a non-Hirsch polytope of dimension d and excess .
Then, for each k ∈ N there is an infinite family of non-Hirsch polytopes of
dimension kd and with excess greater than
1−

.

Proof. Let n be the number of facets of P and let l = (n − d)( + 1) be its
diameter. The k-fold power P k has dimension kd, it has kn facets and it has
diameter kl. Now, glue an arbitrary number, say j of copies of P k to one
another. Corollary 6.3 says that the polytope Pk,l so obtained has dimension
kd, it has j(kn − kd) + kd facets and it has diameter j(kl − 1) + 1. Let us
compute its excess:

To finish the proof we just need to show that

≤ . This is so because

In particular, starting with the non-Hirsch polytope of Corollary 1.7, which
has dimension 43, 86 facets and diameter 44 ( = 1/43), we can get infinite
sequences of excess 1/86 in dimension 86 and of excess as close to 1/43 as we
want in fixed (but very high) dimension d. With the improved counterexamples announced in [36] the numbers 43 and 86 can be replaced by 20 and 40,
respectively.
Remark 6.6. From the last sentence in the proof of Theorem 6.5 we see that
if P violates the Hirsch inequality by an amount b = l − n + d greater than 1
then the conclusion of the theorem can be improved to
1−

.

That is, the lower bound for the excess that we get in each dimension is slightly
increased, but it is still smaller than the original excess of P . We do not know
of any operation that can be applied to a non-Hirsch polytope and yield another
one with higher excess.
