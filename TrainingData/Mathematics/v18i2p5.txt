Abstract
Any permutation statistic f : S → C may be represented uniquely as a, possibly
infinite, linear combination of (classical) permutation patterns: f = Στ λf (τ )τ . To
provide explicit expansions for certain statistics, we introduce a new type of permutation patterns that we call mesh patterns. Intuitively, an occurrence of the mesh
pattern p = (π, R) is an occurrence of the permutation pattern π with additional
restrictions specified by R on the relative position of the entries of the occurrence.
We show that, for any mesh pattern p = (π, R), we have λp (τ ) = (−1)|τ |−|π| p⋆ (τ )
where p⋆ = (π, Rc ) is the mesh pattern with the same underlying permutation as
p but with complementary restrictions. We use this result to expand some well
known permutation statistics, such as the number of left-to-right maxima, descents,
excedances, fixed points, strong fixed points, and the major index. We also show
that alternating permutations, Andr´e permutations of the first kind and simsun permutations occur naturally as permutations avoiding certain mesh patterns. Finally,
we provide new natural Mahonian statistics.

Introduction

1.1

Mesh patterns

Let [a, b] be the integer interval {i ∈ Z : a ≤ i ≤ b}. Denote by Sn the set of permutations
of [1, n]. A mesh pattern is a pair
p = (π, R) with π ∈ Sk and R ⊆ [0, k] × [0, k].
An example is p = 3241, {(0, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3)} . To depict this mesh pattern
we plot the points (i, π(i)) in a Cartesian coordinate system, and for each (i, j) ∈ R we
shade the unit square with bottom left corner (i, j):

Let p = (π, R) be a mesh pattern with k = |π|, where |π| denotes the number of
letters in π, and let τ ∈ Sn . We will think of p as a function on permutations that counts
occurrences of p. Intuitively, p(τ ) is the number of “classical” occurrences of π in τ with
additional restrictions on the relative position of the entries of the occurrence of π in τ .
These restrictions say that no elements of τ are allowed in the shaded regions of the figure
above. Formally, an occurrence of p in τ is a subset ω of the plot of τ , G(τ ) = {(i, τ (i)) :
i ∈ [1, n]}, such that there are order-preserving injections α, β : [1, k] → [1, n] satisfying
two conditions that we shall now describe. The first condition is that ω is an occurrence
of π in the classical sense. That is,
(i) ω = (α(i), β(j)) : (i, j) ∈ G(π) .
Define Rij = [α(i) + 1, α(i + 1) − 1] × [β(j) + 1, β(j + 1) − 1] for i, j ∈ [0, k], where
α(0) = β(0) = 0 and α(k + 1) = β(k + 1) = n + 1. Then the second condition is
(ii) if (i, j) ∈ R then Rij ∩ G(τ ) = ∅.
Classical [10], vincular [2] and bivincular [4] patterns can all be seen as special mesh
patterns: p = (π, R) is a classical pattern if R = ∅; p is a vincular pattern if R is a union
of vertical strips, {i} × [0, |π|]; p is a bivincular pattern if R is a union of vertical strips
and horizontal strips, [0, |π|] × {i}. An example is provided by the following bivincular
pattern which has been studied by Bousquet-M´elou et al. [4]:
231, [0, 3]×{1} ∪ {1}×[0, 3] =

.

It is also easy to write any barred pattern [14] with only one barred letter as a mesh
pattern. Indeed, if π(i) is the only barred letter of a given barred pattern π, then the
corresponding mesh pattern is (π ′ , {(i − 1, π(i) − 1)}, where π ′ is obtained from π by

removing π(i) and subtracting one from each letter that is larger than π(i). For instance,
West [14] characterized the permutations sortable by two passes through a stack as those
that avoid the classical pattern 2341 and the barred pattern 3¯5241. So, in terms of mesh
patterns, it is the set of permutations that avoid
and

.

The number of saturated chains in Young’s Lattice from ˆ0 (the empty partition) to a
partition λ is the number of standard Young tableaux of shape λ, and the total number
of saturated chains from ˆ0 to rank n is the number of involutions in Sn . Bergeron et
al. [3] studied a composition analogue of Young’s lattice. They gave an embedding of the
saturated chains from ˆ0 to rank n into Sn , and they characterized the image under this
embedding as follows: Let T (π) be the increasing binary tree corresponding to π.1 Then
π ∈ Sn encodes a saturated chain from ˆ0 to rank n if and only if for any vertex v of T (π)
that do not belong to the leftmost branch of T (π) and has two sons, the label of the left
son is less that the label of the right son. There is a unique smallest permutation not
satisfying this, namely 1423; the corresponding increasing binary tree is

In terms of mesh patterns the permutations encoding saturated chains from ˆ0 to rank n
are precisely those that avoid
.
By p(τ ) we shall denote the number of occurrences of p in τ , thus regarding p as a
function from S = ∪n≥0 Sn to N. We will now explain how a few well known permutation
statistics may be expressed in terms of mesh patterns. A left-to-right maximum of τ is an
index j such that τ (i) < τ (j) for i < j. We write lmax(τ ) for the number of left-to-right
maxima in τ . A descent is an i such that τ (i) > τ (i+1). The number of descents is denoted
des(τ ). An inversion is a pair i < j such that τ (i) > τ (j). The number of inversions
is denoted inv(τ ). For permutations α and β, let their direct sum be α ⊕ β = αβ ′ ,
where β ′ is obtained from β by adding |α| to each of its letters, and juxtaposition denotes
concatenation. We say that τ has k components, and write comp(τ ) = k, if τ is the direct
sum of k, but not k + 1, non-empty permutations. We have
lmax =

inv =

des =

comp =

If π is the empty word then T (π) is the empty tree. Otherwise, write π = σaτ with a = min(π), then
T (π) is the binary tree with root a attached to a left subtree T (σ) and a right subtree T (τ ).

Permutation statistics and an incidence algebra

In what follows we will often simply write π instead of (π, ∅), so inv = 21. We shall see
that any function stat : S → C may be represented uniquely as a (possibly infinite) sum
stat = π∈S λ(π)π, where {λ(π)}π∈S ⊂ C.
Let Q be a locally finite poset, and let Int(Q) = {(x, y) ∈ Q × Q : x ≤ y}. Recall
that the incidence algebra, I(Q), of (Q, ≤) over C is the C-algebra of all functions F :
Int(Q) → C with multiplication (convolution) defined by
(F G)(x, z) =

F (x, y)G(y, z),
x≤y≤z

and identity, δ, defined by δ(x, y) = 1 if x = y, and δ(x, y) = 0 if x = y; see for example
[11, Sec. 3.6].
Define a partial order on S by π ≤ σ in S if π(σ) > 0. Define P ∈ I(S) by
P (π, σ) = π(σ).
Note that P is invertible because P (π, π) = 1, see [11, Prop. 3.6.2]. Therefore, for any
permutation statistic, stat : S → C, there are unique scalars {λ(σ)}σ∈S ⊂ C such that
stat =

λ(σ)σ.

(1)

σ∈S

In other words, any permutation statistic can be written as a unique, typically infinite,
formal linear combination of (classical) patterns. Indeed, I(S) acts on the right of CS by
(f ∗ F )(π) =

f (σ)F (σ, π).
σ≤π

Thus (1) is equivalent to stat = λ ∗ P and, since P is invertible, λ = stat ∗P −1.

The Reciprocity Theorem

The following mysterious looking identity for the descent statistic
des =

(−1)|π| π

π∈S
π(1)>π(|π|)

is an instance of what we call the Reciprocity Theorem for mesh patterns. It tells us what
the coefficients {λ(σ)}σ∈S are in the special case when stat = p, a mesh pattern. The Reciprocity Theorem may be viewed as a justification for the introduction of mesh patterns.
Indeed it shows that to describe the coefficients of “generalized permutation patterns”
requires that the set of patterns is closed under taking complementary restrictions.

Theorem 1 (Reciprocity). Let p = (π, R) be a mesh pattern and let p⋆ = (π, Rc ), where
Rc = [0, |π|]2 \ R. Then
λ(σ)σ, where λ(σ) = (−1)|σ|−|π| p⋆ (σ).

p=
σ∈S

Proof. We need to prove that p⋆ (τ ) = σ≤τ (−1)|π|−|σ| p(σ)σ(τ ) for all τ ∈ S. We will
think of an occurrence of a pattern p in σ as the corresponding subword of σ. The
right-hand side may be written as
(−1)|π|−|σ| ,

(2)

(ωπ ,ωσ )

in which sum is over all pairs (ωπ , ωσ ) where ωπ is a occurrence of p in ωσ and ωσ is an
occurrence of some σ ≤ τ . Expression (2) may, in turn, be written as
(−1)|π| µ(ωπ ),
ωπ

where µ(ωπ ) is the contribution from a given occurrence ωπ of π. Given ωπ , to create a
pair (ωπ , ωσ ) we include any elements which are in squares not indexed by the restrictions
R. Let X(ωπ ) be the set of such elements. Hence
(−1)|π|+|S|.

µ(ωπ ) =
S⊆X(ωπ )

Thus µ(ωπ ) = 0 unless X(ωπ ) = ∅. Clearly X(ωπ ) = ∅ if and only if ωπ = ωσ and ωσ is
an occurrence of p⋆ . Consequently, ωπ (−1)|π| µ(ωπ ) = p⋆ (τ ), as claimed.
Corollary 2 (Inverse Theorem). The inverse of P in I(S) is given by
P −1(π, τ ) = (−1)|τ |−|π| P (π, τ ).
Equivalently, if f, g : S → C, then
f (π) =

g(σ)σ(π),

for all π ∈ S

σ≤π

if and only if
f (σ)(−1)|π|−|σ| σ(π),

g(π) =

for all π ∈ S.

σ≤π

Proof. For π ∈ Sk , let p = (π, [0, k] × [0, k]). Then p⋆ = (π, ∅) and p(τ ) = δ(π, τ ), so by
the Reciprocity Theorem,
(−1)|σ|−|π| P (π, σ)P (σ, τ ),

δ(π, τ ) =
π≤σ≤τ

from which the result follows.

Expansions of some permutation statistics

Babson and Steingr´ımsson’s [2] classification of Mahonian statistics is in terms of vincular
patterns. For example, the major index, maj, can be defined as
(21, {1} × [0, 2]) + (132, {2} × [0, 3]) + (231, {2} × [0, 3]) + (321, {2} × [0, 3]),
or in pictures:
maj =

By the Reciprocity Theorem we may represent the major index as maj =

where n = |π|.
Now, let us plot the values of π ∈ S in a Cartesian coordinate system and locate the
position of x = π(j):
Q2 (π; x) Q1 (π; x)
x
Q3 (π; x) Q4 (π; x)
j
Here Q2 (π; x) = {π(i) : i < j and π(i) > x}, and the sets Qk (π; x) for k = 1, 3, 4 are
defined similarly. Many permutation patterns are defined in terms of the Qk ’s.
• x is a left-to-right maximum if Q2 (π; x) = ∅. Recall that lmax(π) denotes the
number of left-to-right maxima in π;
• x is a fixed point if |Q2 (π; x)| = |Q4 (π; x)|. Denote by fix(π) the number of fixed
points in π;

• The excess of x in π is x − j = |Q4 (π; x)| − |Q2 (π; x)|. For k ∈ Z, let exck (π) be the
number of x in π for which |Q4 (π; x)| − |Q2 (π; x)| = k;
• x is an excedance top if |Q4 (π; x)| > |Q2 (π; x)|. Denote by exc(π) the number of
excedance tops in π;
• x is a strong fixed point if Q2 (π; x) = Q4 (π; x) = ∅, see [11, Ex. 1.32b]. Denote by
sfix(π) the number of strong fixed points in π;
• x is a skew strong fixed point if Q1 (π; x) = Q3 (π; x) = ∅. Denote by ssfix(π) the
number of skew strong fixed points in π. Moreover, let SSF(π) be the set of skew
strong fixed points in π.

of ω that has excess k in ω. Let alph(ω) denote the set of letters in ω. Note that
(x, ω) ∈ Ωk (π) if and only if Q2 (π; x) ∩ alph(ω) + k = Q4 (π; x) ∩ alph(ω) . Let α(x) =

π obtained by adding α(x) to ω at the correct position. The mapping Ψ is well-defined
since the property of x having excess k is invariant under adding elements to Q1 (x) and
Q3 (x). Also, Ψ reverses the sign, (−1)|π|−|ω| , on non fixed points. Moreover, (x, ω) is a

Euler numbers

A permutation π ∈ Sn is said to be alternating if

vincular/mesh patterns

In 1879, Andr´e [1] showed that the number of alternating permutations in Sn is the Euler
number En given by
En xn /n! = sec x + tan x.
n≥0

There are several other sets of permutations enumerated by the Euler numbers, see [12]. A
simsun permutation may be defined as a permutation π ∈ Sn for which for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n,
after removing the i largest letters of π, the remaining word has no double descents. In
terms of mesh patterns, a permutation is simsun if and only if it avoids the pattern
simsun =

.

simsun permutations are central in describing the action of the symmetric group on the
maximal chains of the partition lattice, and the number of simsun permutations in Sn is
the Euler number En+1 , see [13].
Another important class of permutations counted by the Euler numbers are the Andr´e
permutations of various kinds introduced by Foata and Sch¨
utzenberger [6] and further
studied by Foata and Strehl [7]. If π ∈ Sn and x = π(i) ∈ [1, n] let λ(x), ρ(x) ⊂ [1, n] be
defined as follows. Let π(0) = π(n + 1) = −∞.
• λ(x) = {π(k) : j0 < k < i} where j0 = max{j : j < i and π(j) < π(i)}, and
• ρ(x) = {π(k) : i < k < j1 } where j1 = min{j : i < j and π(j) < π(i)}.
A permutation π ∈ Sn is an Andr´e permutation of the first kind if
max λ(x) ≤ max ρ(x)
for all x ∈ [1, n], where max ∅ = −∞. In particular, π has no double descents and π(n −
1) < π(n) = n. The concept of Andr´e permutations of the first kind extends naturally
to permutation of any finite totally ordered set. The following recursive description of
Andr´e permutations of the first kind follows immediately from the definition.
Lemma 6. Let π ∈ Sn be such that π(n) = n. Write π as the concatenation π = L1R.
Then π is an Andr´e permutation of the first kind if and only if L and R are Andr´e
permutations of the first kind.
Theorem 7. Let π ∈ Sn . Then π is an Andr´e permutation of the first kind if and only
if it avoids
andr´e =

and

.

Proof. Note that π ∈ Sn avoids the second pattern if and only if π(n) = n. Write π as
π = L1R. Then π avoids andr´e if and only if L and R avoid the two patterns. Thus the
set of all permutations that avoid the two patterns have the same recursive description
as the set of all Andr´e permutation of the first kind, and hence the sets agree.

Using a computer, it is not hard to see that up to trivial symmetries the only essentially

andr´e.

New Mahonian Statistics

There are many ways of expressing the permutation statistic inv as a sum of mesh patterns. For instance,
inv =

+

.

(3)

Indeed, given π ∈ Sn we may partition the set of inversions2 of π into two sets as follows.
Let I + (π) denote the set of inversions that play the role of 21 in some occurrence of 213,
and let I − (π) denote the set of inversions that do not play the role of 21 in any occurrence
of 213. Then the first pattern in the right-hand-side of (3) agrees with π → |I − (π)|, and
the second with π → |I + (π)|.
There is a similar decomposition of non-inversions:
12 =

+

.

(4)

Now A+ (π) is the set of non-inversions that play the role of 12 in some occurrence of 123,
and A− (π) is the set of non-inversions that do not play the role of 12 in any occurrence
of 123.
Can we mix the patterns in (3) and (4) and still get a Mahonian statistic? Let
mix =

+

.

We will prove that mix is Mahonian. Since mix(π) = |A− (π)| + |I + (π)| and 12(π) =
|A− (π)| + |A+ (π)| it suffices to find a bijection ψ that fixes |A− (π)| and is such that
|A+ (ψ(π))| = |I + (π)|. In fact we will prove more. Let M, I ⊆ [n] be such that |M| = |I|
and n ∈ M ∩ I, and let Sn (M, I) be the set of permutations in Sn that have right-to-left
maxima exactly at the positions indexed by I, and set of values of the right-to-left maxima

Here the set of inversions means the set of occurrences of the pattern 21, not the positions of the
inversions.

equal to M. Let π ∈ Sn (M, I), and define two functions ci(π), ca(π) : [n] \ M → [n − 1]
by
ci(π)(y) = |Iy+ |,
ca(π)(y) = |A+
y |,

where Iy+ = {x : (y, x) ∈ I + (π)}, and
+
where A+
y = {x : (x, y) ∈ A (π)}.

Lemma 9. Let M, I ⊆ [n] be such that |M| = |I| and n ∈ M ∩ I. Then
ci(π) = ci(σ) if and only if π = σ,
and
ca(π) = ca(σ) if and only if π = σ,
for all π, σ ∈ Sn (M, I).
Proof. Suppose that we know ci(π), and let [n] \ M = {s1 < · · · < sk }. Then ci(π)(sk )
tells us the position of sk in π, and recursively we can read off the position of si from
ci(π)(si ), given that we know the positions of si+1 , . . . , sk . Hence we can reconstruct π
from ci(π).
Suppose that s1 , . . . , sj are the elements of [n]\M that are smaller than min(M). Then
ca(π)(sj ) tells us the position of sj in π, and recursively we can read off the position of si
from ca(π)(si ), given that we know the positions of si+1 , . . . , sj . We can continue in the
same way to read off the positions of the elements of [n]\M that are between min(M) and
min(M \ {min(M)}) in size. Continuing this procedure we will recover π from ca(π).
Theorem 10. Let M, I ⊆ [n] be such that |M| = |I| and n ∈ M ∩ I. There is an
involution ψ : Sn (M, I) → Sn (M, I) such that
ca(π), ci(π) = ci(ψ(π)), ca(ψ(π)) ,
for all π ∈ Sn (M, I). Moreover, ψ fixes |A− (π)|.
Proof. Let M = {m1 < · · · < mk } and let Bi be the set of entries of π that are smaller
than and to the left of mi . For S ⊆ [n], let ψS (π) be the permutation obtained by reversing
the subword of π that is a permutation on S. Define ψ by
ψ = ψB1 ◦ ψB2 ∩B1 ◦ · · · ◦ ψBk−1 ◦ ψBk ∩Bk−1 ◦ ψBk .
For instance, with π = 125634 we have B1 = {1, 2, 3}, B2 = {1, 2, 5} and
ψ(π) = ψB1 ◦ ψB1 ∩B2 ◦ ψB2 (125634)
= ψB1 ◦ ψB1 ∩B2 (521634)
= ψB1 (512634)
= 532614.
It is easy to see that ψ : Sn (M, I) → Sn (M, I) and that ψ fixes |A− (π)|.

For fixed y we want to show that (|A+
y |, |Iy |) → (|Iy |, |Ay |) under ψ. If S is a subset
+
of a Bj that does not contain y then |A+
y | and |Iy | are unchanged under ψS . Let r be the
largest index for which y ∈ Br , and let s be the smallest index for which y ∈ Bs . Write
ψ as ψ = α ◦ β ◦ γ where

β = ψBs ◦ ψBs+1 ∩Bs ◦ · · · ◦ ψBr−1 ◦ ψBr ∩Br−1 ◦ ψBr .
+
Now y is not moved, and (|A+
y |, |Iy |) is conserved, by γ. Moreover y will remain outside
B1 ∪ · · · ∪ Bs−1 when we apply α after the action of β ◦ γ. Hence it remains to consider the
+
+
effect on (|A+
y |, |Iy |) under β. Suppose x ∈ Ay . Then β switches (x, y) an odd number
+
+
+
+
of times. Hence x ∈ Iy after having applied β. Since A+
y ∪ Iy ⊆ Bs , the set Ay ∪ Iy
+
+
+
remains unchanged under the mappings defining β. It follows that (A+
y , Iy ) → (Iy , Ay )
under β. We have proved that (ca(π), ci(π)) = (ci(ψ(π)), ca(ψ(π))). By Lemma 9 ψ is
an involution.

Using a computer we have searched for Mahonian statistics that are of the form
(12, R) + (π, S), with π ∈ S3 , R ⊆ [0, 2] × [0, 2] and S ⊆ [0, 3] × [0, 3]. Up to trivial
symmetries one new Mahonian statistic apart from mix was found. Namely
mix′ =

+

.

Again, mix′ is, in a sense, a mix of inv and 12. To be more precise, let
S1 =

,

S2 =

,

T1 =

and T2 =

.

Then 12 = S1 + T1 , inv = S2 + T2 and mix′ = S1 + T2 . We note here that S1 and T1 have
appeared before in the literature: S1 measure the major cost of the in-situ permutation
algorithm [8, 9]; the statistic inv +T1 is identical to lbsum in [5].
Let nk = [n]!/([k]![n − k]!) denote the usual q1 , q2 -binomial coefficient, where [n]! =
[1][2] . . . [n] and [n] = q1n−1 +q1n−2 q2 +· · ·+q1 q2n−2 +q2n−1 . The q1 , q2 -derivative of a function
f (x) is defined by

Proof. Let π ∈ Sn+1 and write π = L(n + 1)R. Let A = alph(L) ⊆ [n] be the letters in
L. Then
S1 (π) = S1 (L) + S1 (R) + k,
S2 (π) = S2 (L) + S2 (R) + n − k,
T1 (π) = T1 (L) + T1 (R) + k(n − k) − γ(A),
T2 (π) = T2 (L) + T2 (R) + γ(A),
where k = |A| and γ(A) = {(i, j) : i ∈ A, j ∈ [n] \ A, i > j}. Thus

We also have, e.g. from [11, Prop 1.3.17, m = 2, a1 = k, a2 = n − k], that

which proves the recursion formula. The equation for the q1 , q2 -exponential generating
function follows.
The fact that mix′ is Mahonian now follows from the symmetry of the variables in the
recursion formula.
Corollary 12. The statistic mix′ is Mahonian.
