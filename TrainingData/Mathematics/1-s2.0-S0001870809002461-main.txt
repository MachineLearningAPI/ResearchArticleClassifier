Abstract
Minkowski’s projection bodies have evolved into Lp projection bodies and their asymmetric analogs.
These all turn out to be part of a far larger class of Orlicz projection bodies. The analog of the classical
Petty projection inequality is established for the new Orlicz projection bodies.

As Schneider [58] observes, the classical Brunn–Minkowski theory emerged at the turn of
the 19th into the 20th century, when Minkowski began his study of the volume of (what would
become known as) the Minkowski sum of convex bodies. In addition to mixed volumes, one of
the core concepts that Minkowski introduced within the Brunn–Minkowski theory is that of a
projection body (precise definitions to follow). Four decades ago, in a highly influential paper,
Bolker [5] illustrated how Minkowski’s projection operator, its range, and its polar were in fact
objects of independent investigation in a number of disciplines.
Within the Brunn–Minkowski theory, the two classical inequalities which connect the volume
of a convex body with that of its polar projection body are the Petty and Zhang projection inequalities. In retrospect, it is interesting to observe that these inequalities were not discovered
by Minkowski. Nor did they emerge out of Blaschke’s school. In fact, it took seven decades
from Minkowski’s discovery of projection bodies for the Petty projection inequality to appear

(see e.g., the books by Gardner [17], Leichtweiss [27], Schneider [58], and Thompson [61] for
reference). It took yet another two decades for the Zhang projection inequality to be discovered.
Establishing the analogs of the Petty and Zhang projection inequalities for the projection operator (as opposed to the polar projection operator) are today major open problems within the field
of convex geometric analysis.
Unlike the classical isoperimetric inequality, the Petty and Zhang projection inequalities are
affine isoperimetric inequalities in that they are inequalities between a pair of geometric functionals whose ratio is invariant under affine transformations. The Petty projection inequality is
not only stronger than (i.e., directly implies) the classical isoperimetric inequality, but it can be
viewed as an optimal isoperimetric inequality. In the same manner that the classical isoperimetric
inequality leads to (in fact is equivalent to) the Sobolev inequality, the Petty projection inequality
has led to the affine Sobolev inequality [66] that is stronger than the classical Sobolev inequality
and yet is independent of any underlying Euclidean structure.
In the early 1960s, Firey (see e.g. Schneider [58, p. 383]) introduced an Lp extension of
Minkowski’s addition (now known as Firey–Minkowski Lp -addition) of convex bodies. In the
mid 1990s, it was shown in [36,37], that a study of the volume of these Firey–Minkowski Lp combinations leads to an embryonic Lp Brunn–Minkowski theory. This theory has expanded
rapidly. (See e.g. [2,3,6–12,16,19–25,28–34,36–47,50,51,57,59,60,62–65].)
An early achievement of the new Lp Brunn–Minkowski theory was the discovery of Lp
analogs of projection bodies and of the Petty projection inequality [40], with an alternate approach to establishing this inequality presented by Campi and Gronchi in [6]. These new inequalities have found applications in the field of analytic inequalities where they led to affine Lp
Sobolev inequalities [43] and ultimately to affine Moser–Trudinger and affine Morrey–Sobolev
inequalities [11].
Work of Ludwig [31] (see also [28]) showed that the known Lp extension of the projection
operator considered in [40] is only one of a family of natural Lp extensions of their classical counterpart. Using this insight, Haberl and Schuster [23] (see also [24]) considered so-called
“asymmetric” Lp analogs and obtained “asymmetric” Lp analogs of the Petty projection inequality. For bodies that are not symmetric about the origin, the inequalities of Haberl and Schuster are
stronger than the original Lp Petty projection inequality. The operators considered by Haberl and
Schuster appear to be ideally suited for non-symmetric bodies. This can be seen most clearly by
looking at the Lp analog of the classical Blaschke–Santaló inequality presented in [39]. For origin symmetric bodies, this Lp extension does recover the original Blaschke–Santaló inequality
as p → ∞. However, for arbitrary bodies only the Haberl–Schuster version does so.
The above cited work of Haberl and Schuster and the recent work of Ludwig and Reitzner
[34], as well as Ludwig [33], makes it apparent that the time is ripe for the next step in the
evolution of the Brunn–Minkowski theory towards what we call an Orlicz–Brunn–Minkowski
theory. It is the aim of this paper to define Orlicz projection bodies and establish an Orlicz
analog of the classical Petty projection inequality — an inequality that we call the Orlicz Petty
projection inequality. The new inequality has all its predecessors (including the Haberl–Schuster
version) as special cases.
Another classical affine isoperimetric inequality is the Busemann–Petty centroid inequality [56]. This is an inequality between the volume of a convex body and that of its centroid
body. The centroid body is a concept that goes back at least to Dupin. Another early achievement within the Lp Brunn–Minkowski theory (and its dual) was the establishment of the Lp
analog of the Busemann–Petty centroid inequality [6,40] for the natural Lp extension of centroid bodies. The Lp extensions of the centroid operator quickly became an object of interest

222

in asymptotic geometric analysis (see e.g. [13,15,18,26,52–55]) and even the theory of stable
distributions (see [51]).
It was shown in [35] that once the Busemann–Petty centroid inequality has been established,
the Petty projection inequality can be obtained as an almost effortless consequence. In addition,
it was shown in [35] that also the reverse is the case: the Busemann–Petty centroid inequality
can be obtained easily from the Petty projection inequality. As shown in [40], a similar relationship holds between the Lp Petty projection inequality and the Lp Busemann–Petty centroid
inequalities: only one of these two inequalities needs to be established and then the other can be
quickly derived. It appears that this might not be the case for the Orlicz analogues of these classical inequalities. (See the discussion in Section 4.) Neither the Orlicz Petty projection inequality
nor the Orlicz Busemann–Petty centroid inequality appears to lead to the other in some manner
discernable to the authors. Therefore, the topic of Orlicz centroid bodies is treated in a separate
work [48].
We consider convex φ : R → [0, ∞) such that φ(0) = 0. This means that φ must be decreasing
on (−∞, 0] and increasing on [0, ∞). We will assume throughout that one of these is happening
strictly so; i.e., φ is either strictly decreasing on (−∞, 0] or strictly increasing on [0, ∞).
Let K be a convex body in Rn that contains the origin in its interior, and that has volume
|K|. The Orlicz projection body Πφ K of K is defined as the body whose support function (see
Section 1 for definitions) is given by

hΠφ K (x) = inf λ > 0:

φ
∂K

x · ν(y)
y · ν(y) dHn−1 (y)
λy · ν(y)

n|K| ,

where ν(y) is the outer unit normal of ∂K at y ∈ ∂K, where x · ν(y) denotes the inner product
of x and ν(y), and Hn−1 is (n − 1)-dimensional Hausdorff measure. Recall that ν(y) exists for
Hn−1 -almost all y ∈ ∂K. For the polar (see Section 1 for definitions) of Πφ K we will write
Πφ∗ K.
With φ1 (t) = |t|, it turns out that for u ∈ S n−1 ,
hΠφ1 K (u) =

cn
|Ku |,
|K|

where |Ku | denotes the (n − 1)-dimensional volume of Ku , the image of the orthogonal projection of K onto the subspace u⊥ . Thus
Πφ 1 K =

where ΠK is the classical projection body of K introduced by Minkowski. With φp (t) = |t|p ,
and p 1,

We will prove the following volume ratio inequality.
Orlicz Petty projection inequality. If K is a convex body in Rn that contains the origin in its
interior, then the volume ratio
Πφ∗ K /|K|
is maximized when K is an ellipsoid centered at the origin. If φ is strictly convex, then ellipsoids
centered at the origin are the only maximizers.
When φ(t) = |t|, the Orlicz Petty projection inequality is the classical Petty projection inequality. When φ(t) = |t|p , and p > 1, the Orlicz Petty projection inequality is the Lp Petty
projection inequality (established in [40], with an alternate proof given by Campi and Gronchi
in [6]). Haberl and Schuster’s recent extension [23] of the Lp Petty projection inequality is the
case φ(t) = (|t| + αt)p , for −1 α 1 of the Orlicz Petty projection inequality.
In Section 1, we establish notation and list some basic facts regarding convex functions and
convex bodies. In Section 2 some of the basic properties of Orlicz projection bodies are established. Section 3 contains the proof of the Orlicz Petty projection inequality. In Section 4 some
questions are posed.
1. Basics regarding convex bodies
The setting will be Euclidean n-space Rn . We write e1 , . . . , en for the standard orthonormal
basis of Rn and when we write Rn = Rn−1 × R we always assume that en is associated with the
last factor.
We will attempt to use x, y for vectors in Rn and x , y for vectors in Rn−1 , and u, v ∈ S n−1
for unit vectors. We will use a, b, s, t, α for numbers in R and c, λ for strictly positive reals. If Q
is a Borel subset of Rn and Q is contained in an i-dimensional affine subspace of Rn but in no
affine subspace of lower dimension, then |Q| will denote the√i-dimensional Lebesgue measure
of Q. If x ∈ Rn then by abuse of notation we will write |x| = x · x.
For A ∈ GL(n) write At for the transpose of A and A−t for the inverse of the transpose
(contragradient) of A. Write |A| for the absolute value of the determinant of A.
We shall write cn for a constant depending only on n and cn,p for a constant depending only
on n and p. For a ∈ R define
(a)+ = max{a, 0} and (a)− = min{a, 0}.
Let C be the class of convex functions φ : R → [0, ∞) such that φ(0) = 0 and such that φ
is either strictly decreasing on (−∞, 0] or φ is strictly increasing on [0, ∞). We say that the
sequence {φi }, where the φi ∈ C, is such that φi → φo ∈ C provided

224

E. Lutwak et al. / Advances in Mathematics 223 (2010) 220–242

|φi − φo |I := max φi (t) − φo (t) → 0,
t∈I

for every compact interval I ⊂ R. The subclass of C consisting of those φ ∈ C that are strictly
convex will be denoted by Cs .
We shall make use of the fact that for φ ∈ C and a1 , a2 , a3 , a4 ∈ R with a3 , a4 > 0,
(a3 + a4 )φ

a1 + a2
a3 + a4

a3 φ

a3

+ a4 φ

a2
.
a4

(1.1)

This is a trivial consequence of the convexity of φ. If φ ∈ Cs , then observe that there is equality
in (1.1) if and only if a1 /a3 = a2 /a4 .
Define cφ by
cφ = min c > 0: max φ(c), φ(−c)

1 .

(1.2)

We write Kn for the set of convex bodies (compact convex subsets) of Rn . We write Kno for
the set of convex bodies that contain the origin in their interiors.
For K ∈ Kn , let h(K; ·) = hK : Rn → R denote the support function of K; i.e., h(K; x) =
max{x · y: y ∈ K}. Thus, if y ∈ ∂K, then
hK νK (y) = νK (y) · y,
where νK (y) denotes an outer unit normal to ∂K at y. Obviously, when c > 0, for the support
function of the convex body cK = {cx: x ∈ K} we have
hcK = chK .

(1.3)

Observe that from the definition of the support function it follows immediately that for A ∈
GL(n) the support function of the image AK = {Ay: y ∈ K} is given by
hAK (x) = hK At x .

(1.4)

If Ki ∈ Kn , we say that Ki → Ko ∈ Kn provided
|hKi − hKo |∞ := max hKi (u) − hKo (u) → 0.
u∈S n−1

If K ∈ Kno , then the polar body K ∗ is defined by
K ∗ = x ∈ Rn : x · y

1 for all y ∈ K .

It is easy to see that for c > 0,
1
(cK)∗ = K ∗ ,
c

(1.5)

E. Lutwak et al. / Advances in Mathematics 223 (2010) 220–242

225

and more generally that for A ∈ GL(n)
(AK)∗ = A−t K ∗ .
It is easy to verify that
K ∗∗ = K.
We require the easily established continuity of the polar operator ∗ : Kno → Kno that maps
K → K∗.
Let ρ(K; ·) = ρK : Rn \ {0} → [0, ∞) denote radial function of K ∈ Kno ; i.e. ρK (x) =
max{λ > 0: λx ∈ K}. From the definition, it follows immediately that
x ∈ K \ ∂K

if and only if

ρK (x) > 1.

(1.6)

It is easily verified that
hK ∗ = 1/ρK

and ρK ∗ = 1/ hK .

(1.7)

Observe that from (1.6) and (1.7) it follows immediately that for x ∈ Rn
h(K; x) = 1 if and only if

x ∈ ∂K ∗ .

(1.8)

The classical Aleksandrov–Fenchel–Jessen surface area measure, SK , of the convex body K
can be defined as the unique Borel measure on S n−1 such that
f (u) dSK (u) =

f νK (y) dHn−1 (y),

(1.9)

∂K

S n−1

for each continuous f : S n−1 → R. We shall require the trivial observation that for the surface
area measure of cK we have
ScK = cn−1 SK ,

(1.10)

and the fact that for K ∈ Kno the measure SK cannot be concentrated on a hemisphere of S n−1 .
Less trivial, but much needed is the fact that SK is weakly continuous in K (see e.g. Schneider
[58, p. 201]); i.e., if Ki ∈ Kno , then
Ki → Ko ∈ Kno

⇒

SKi → SKo , weakly.

is equal to |K| can be easily seen by considering a polytope P ∈ Kno whose faces have areas (i.e.,
(n − 1)-dimensional volumes) a1 , . . . , am , corresponding outer unit normals u1 , . . . , um , with
facial cones (i.e., the cones whose bases are the faces of P and whose vertex is the origin) of

For K ∈ Kno , it will be convenient to use the volume-normalized conical measure VK defined
by

Observe that
VK is a probability measure on S n−1 .

(1.11)

For K ∈ Kno , define RK , rK ∈ (0, ∞) by
RK = max hK (u)
u∈S n−1

and rK = min hK (u).

(1.12)

u∈S n−1

From definition (1.9) we have Cauchy’s projection formula,
(u · v)+ dSK (v) = |Ku | and
S n−1

(u · v)− dSK (v) = −|Ku |,
S n−1

for u ∈ S n−1 . From definition (1.12) we see that the diameter,
DK = max hK (u) + hK (−u) ,
u∈S n−1

of a body K is at most 2RK , and since K is obviously contained in the right cylinder whose base
is Ku and whose height is DK we have the crude estimates

and a function g : K → R whose gradient exists a.e., define

g (x ) = g(x ) − x · ∇g(x ).

E. Lutwak et al. / Advances in Mathematics 223 (2010) 220–242

227

We shall often make use of the fact that · is a linear operator; i.e., for g1 , g2 : K → R whose
gradient exists a.e., and α1 , α2 ∈ R,
α1 g1 + α2 g2 = α1 g1 + α2 g2 .

(1.14)

For a convex body K and a direction u ∈ S n−1 , let u (K; ·) : Ku → R and
denote the undergraph and overgraph functions of K with respect to u; i.e.
K = y + tu: − u (K; y )

t

u (K; y

u (K; ·) : Ku

→R

) for y ∈ Ku .

Thus, for the Steiner symmetral, Su K, of K in direction u, we see that the image of the orthogonal
projections onto u⊥ of both K and Su K are identical, and that
u (Su K; y

)=

1
2

u (K; y

)+

u (K; y

) =

u (Su K; y

(1.15)

),

for all y ∈ Ku . Both K and u will be suppressed when clear from the context, and thus we
will often denote the undergraph and overgraph functions of K with respect to u simply by
: Ku → R and : Ku → R.
When considering the convex body K ∈ Kno as K ⊂ Rn−1 × R, then for (x , t) ∈ Rn−1 × R we
will usually write h(K; x , t) rather than h(K; (x , t)). Note that the Steiner symmetral, Sen K,
of K in the direction en can be given by
Sen K =

1
1
x , t + s ∈ Rn−1 × R: (x , t), (x , −s) ∈ K with t = −s ,
2

(1.16)

and its boundary can be given by
∂Sen K =

1
1
x , t + s ∈ Rn−1 × R: (x , t), (x , −s) ∈ ∂K with t = −s .
2
2

(1.17)

We shall make use of the fact that if ui ∈ S n−1 , then
ui → u

⇒

Sui L → Su L,

(1.18)

for each L ∈ Kno .
Finally, we shall make critical use of the following fact that is inspired by the work of Ball [1]
and Meyer and Pajor [49] and that follows directly from (1.16), (1.17), and (1.8).
Lemma 1.1. Suppose K, L ∈ Kno and consider K, L ⊂ Rn−1 × R. Then
S e n K ∗ ⊂ L∗ ,
if and only if
h(K; x , t) = 1 = h(K; x , −s),

with t = −s

⇒

h L; x , t + s
2

228

E. Lutwak et al. / Advances in Mathematics 223 (2010) 220–242

In addition, if Sen K ∗ = L∗ , then h(K; x , t) = 1 = h(K; x , −s), with t = −s, implies that
h(L; x , 12 t + 12 s) = 1.
We say that ∂K is line free in direction u ∈ S n−1 if ∂K ∩ (x + Ru) consists of no more than
two points, for each x ∈ ∂K. Note that if ∂K is line free in direction u then ∂Su K is line free in
direction u. It follows from the Ewald–Larman–Rogers theorem [14] (or see [58, p. 80]) that for
each convex body K
Hn−1 u ∈ S n−1 : ∂K is not line free in direction u

= 0.

(1.19)

We will make use of the well-known and easily established fact that if ∂K is line free in
direction en then for a continuous g : ∂K → R,
g(x) dHn−1 (x)

2. Definition and basic properties of Orlicz projection bodies
The Orlicz projection body Πφ K of K ∈ Kno is defined as the body whose support function is
given by
hΠφ K (x) = inf λ > 0:

φ
∂K

x · ν(y)
y · ν(y) dHn−1 (y)
λy · ν(y)

n|K| ,

(2.1)

where ν(y) = νK (y) is the outer unit normal of ∂K at y ∈ ∂K, or equivalently, using (1.9),
hΠφ K (x) = inf λ > 0:

φ

x·u
hK (u) dSK (u)
λhK (u)

n|K| .

(2.2)

S n−1

It will be easier to see the affine nature (Lemma 2.6) of the Orlicz projection body if we use (1.7)
to rewrite (2.2) as
hΠφ K (x) = inf λ > 0:

φ

1
(x · u)ρK ∗ (u) dVK (u)

1 .

(2.3)

S n−1

The polar body of Πφ K will be denoted by Πφ∗ K, rather than (Πφ K)∗ .
Since the area measure SK cannot be concentrated on a closed hemisphere of S n−1 , and since
we assume that φ is strictly increasing on [0, ∞) or strictly decreasing on (−∞, 0] it follows
that the function

is strictly decreasing in (0, ∞). Thus, we have,
Lemma 2.1. Suppose φ ∈ C and K ∈ Kno . If xo ∈ Rn \ {0}, then
φ

xo · u
dVK (u) = 1
λo hK (u)

S n−1

if and only if
hΠφ K (xo ) = λo .
We first show that hΠφ K is a support function.
Lemma 2.2. Suppose φ ∈ C and K ∈ Kno . Then the function hΠφ K is the support function of a
convex body, Πφ K, that contains the origin in its interior.
Proof. It follows immediately from definition (2.1) that for all x ∈ Rn , and for c > 0
hΠφ K (cx) = chΠφ K (x).
We now show that for x1 , x2 ∈ Rn ,
hΠφ K (x1 + x2 )

hΠφ K (x1 ) + hΠφ K (x2 ).

To that end let
hΠφ K (xi ) = λi .
By Lemma 2.1 this means that
φ

x1 · u
ρK ∗ (u) dVK (u) = 1 and
λ1

S n−1

φ

x2 · u
ρK ∗ (u) dVK (u) = 1.

The convexity of the function s → φ(sρK ∗ (u)) shows that

Integrating both sides of this inequality with respect to the measure VK gives us

(2.4)

230

from hΠφ K (xi ) = λi . But using definition (2.3), inequality (2.4) gives the desired result that
hΠφ K (x1 + x2 )

λ1 + λ2 .

Thus hΠφ K is indeed the support function of a compact convex set. That this set has the origin
in its interior (i.e., that hΠφ K (x) > 0 whenever x = 0) follows easily from the fact that we always
have either lims→∞ φ(s) = ∞ or lims→−∞ φ(s) = ∞. ✷
We shall require more than the fact that Πφ K contains the origin in its interior.
Lemma 2.3. If φ ∈ C and K ∈ Kno , then

To obtain the lower estimate we proceed as follows. From the definition (1.2), either φ(cφ ) = 1
or φ(−cφ ) = 1. Suppose φ(−cφ ) = 1. Hence from the fact that φ is non-negative and φ(0) = 0,
Jensen’s inequality, and (1.13) together with the fact that φ is monotone decreasing on (−∞, 0],
φ(−cφ ) = 1

The case where φ(cφ ) = 1 is handled the same way and gives the same result.

To obtain the upper estimate, observe that from the definition (1.2), together with the fact that
the function t → max{φ(t), φ(−t)} is monotone increasing on [0, ∞) and definition (1.12), and

(2.6)

and taking the polars, and using (1.5),

The Orlicz projection operator Πφ : Kno → Kno is continuous.
Lemma 2.4. If Ki ∈ Kno , then
Ki → K ∈ Kno

⇒

Πφ Ki → Πφ K,

for each φ ∈ C.
Proof. Suppose uo ∈ S n−1 . We will show that
hΠφ Ki (uo ) → hΠφ K (uo ).

Since Ki → K ∈ Kno , we have rKi → rK > 0 and RKi → RK < ∞, and thus there exist a, b
such that 0 < a λi b < ∞, for all i. To show that the bounded sequence {λi } converges to
hΠφ K (uo ), we show that every convergent subsequence of {λi } converges to hΠφ K (uo ). Denote
an arbitrary convergent subsequence of {λi } by {λi } as well, and suppose that for this subsequence we have
λi → λ∗ .
Obviously, 0 < a

b. Let K¯ i = λi Ki . Since λi → λ∗ and Ki → K, we have
K¯ i → λ∗ K.

The fact that hΠφ Ki (uo ) = λi , together with (2.5) and (1.3), shows that hΠφ K¯ i (uo ) = 1; i.e.
φ

uo · u
dVK¯ i (u) = 1,
hK¯ i (u)

for all i. But K¯ i → λ∗ K implies that the functions hK¯ i → hλ∗ K , uniformly, and the measures
SK¯ i → Sλ∗ K , weakly. This in turn implies that the measures VK¯ i → Vλ∗ K , weakly, and hence
using the continuity of φ we have
φ

uo · u
dVλ∗ K (u) = 1,
hλ∗ K (u)

which by Lemma 2.1 gives
hΠφ λ∗ K (uo ) = 1.
This, together with (2.5) and (1.3), yields the desired
hΠφ K (uo ) = λ∗ ,
and shows that hΠφ Ki (uo ) → hΠφ K (uo ).
Since the support functions hΠφ Ki → hΠφ K pointwise (on S n−1 ) they converge uniformly
(see e.g., Schneider [58, p. 54]) completing the proof. ✷

The continuity of the Orlicz projection operator Πφ : Kno → Kno , together with the continuity of the projection operator, now yields the continuity of the polar Orlicz projection operator
Πφ∗ : Kno → Kno .
It turns out that the Orlicz projection body Πφ K is continuous in φ as well as in K.
Lemma 2.5. If φi ∈ C, then
φi → φ ∈ C

⇒

Πφi K → Πφ K,

for each K ∈ Kno .
Proof. Suppose K ∈ Kno and uo ∈ S n−1 . We will first show that
hΠφi K (uo ) → hΠφ K (uo ).
Let
hΠφi K (uo ) = λi ,
and note that Lemma 2.3 gives

cφi rK

Since φi → φ ∈ C, we have cφi → cφ ∈ (0, ∞) and thus there exist a, b such that 0 < a λi
b < ∞, for all i. To show that the bounded sequence {λi } converges to hΠφ K (uo ), we show that
every convergent subsequence of {λi } converges to hΠφ K (uo ). Denote an arbitrary convergent
subsequence of {λi } by {λi } as well, and suppose that for this subsequence we have
λi → λ∗ .
Obviously, 0 < a

b. Since hΠφi K (uo ) = λi , Lemma 2.1 gives

When combined with Lemma 2.1, this gives the desired
hΠφ K (uo ) = λ∗ ,
and completes the argument showing that hΠφi K (uo ) → hΠφ K (uo ).

234

E. Lutwak et al. / Advances in Mathematics 223 (2010) 220–242

Since the support functions hΠφi K → hΠφ K pointwise (on S n−1 ) they converge uniformly and
hence
Πφi K → Πφ K.

✷

We now demonstrate the affine nature of the Orlicz projection operator.
Lemma 2.6. If K ∈ Kno and A ∈ SL(n), then
Πφ AK = A−t Πφ K.
Proof. Suppose P is a polytope whose (n−1)-dimensional faces are F1 , . . . , Fm . Let u1 , . . . , um
be the outer unit normals to the faces, and let h1 , . . . , hm denote the support numbers of the
faces of P ; i.e., h(P ; ui ) = hi . Let V1 , . . . , Vm denote the volumes of the facial cones, so that,
Vi = n1 hi |Fi |. Finally, let V denote the volume of the polytope P .
For A ∈ SL(n), let P = AP = {Ax: x ∈ P }. Let F1 , . . . , Fm denote the faces of P , let
u1 , . . . , um be the outer unit normals of the faces of P and let h1 , . . . , hm denote the corresponding support numbers of P . Since A ∈ SL(n), obviously the volumes V1 , . . . , Vm of the
facial cones of P are such that Vi = Vi .
The face Fi parallel to the subspace u⊥
i is transformed by A into the face Fi = AFi parallel
to (A−t ui )⊥ and thus
ui = A−t ui / A−t ui .

(2.7)

Now hi = h(P , ui ) = h(AP , ui ) = h(P , At ui ), by (1.4). Thus, from (2.7) we have
hi = h P , At ui = h P , ui / A−t ui

= h(P , ui )/ A−t ui = hi / A−t ui .

(2.8)

Now from definition (2.3), the fact that V = V and Vi = Vi together with (2.7) and (2.8),
definition (2.3) again, and finally (1.4), we have
hΠφ AP (x) = hΠφ P (x)

3. Proof of the Orlicz Petty projection inequality
We shall require the following.
Lemma 3.1. If K ⊂ Rn−1 × R is a convex body that contains the origin in its interior, and if ∂K
is line free in direction en , then for (y , t) ∈ Rn−1 × R,
(y , t) · νK (x)

K

where K = Ken denotes the image of the orthogonal projection of K onto the subspace en⊥ =
Rn−1 .
Proof. Note that we abbreviated the overgraph and undergraph functions of K in the direction
en by = en (K; ·) : K → R and = en (K; ·) : K → R; i.e.,
K = x + sen : x ∈ K , − (x )

s

(x ) .

For x ∈ K , denote the outer unit normal of the overgraph of K at (x , (x )) by ν(x ). Thus,
ν(x ) =

(−∇ (x ), 1)
1

(1 + |∇ (x )|2 ) 2

.

Denote the outer unit normal of the undergraph of K at (x , − (x )) by ν(x ), so that
ν(x ) =

(−∇ (x ), −1)
1

(1 + |∇ (x )|2 ) 2

.

When x is on the overgraph of ∂K, i.e., x = (x , (x )), we have
x · νK (x) = x , (x ) · ν(x ) =

(x )
1

(1 + |∇ (x )|2 ) 2

(3.1)

.

When x is on the undergraph of ∂K, i.e., x = (x , − (x )), we have
x · νK (x) = x , − (x ) · ν(x ) =
To complete the proof we now appeal to (1.20).

We now establish the main ingredient in the proof of the Orlicz Petty projection inequality.

236

E. Lutwak et al. / Advances in Mathematics 223 (2010) 220–242

Proposition 3.1. Suppose φ ∈ C. If K ∈ Kno and ∂K is line free in direction u, then
Su Πφ∗ K ⊆ Πφ∗ (Su K).

(3.3)

If φ ∈ Cs and Su Πφ∗ K = Πφ∗ (Su K), then all of the midpoints of the chords of K parallel to u lie
on a hyperplane that passes through the origin.
Proof. Without loss of generality, assume that u = en . We will be appealing to Lemma 1.1 and
thus we begin by supposing that
h(Πφ K; y , t) = 1 and h(Πφ K; y , −s) = 1,
with t = −s, or equivalently, by (1.8), that
(y , t) ∈ ∂Πφ∗ K

and (y , −s) ∈ ∂Πφ∗ K.

By Lemma 2.1 this means that

As an aside, observe that if φ is strictly convex, then (1.1) tells us that equality in the inequality
of (3.6) would imply that
t − y · ∇ (x )
(x )

=

s − y · ∇ (x )
(x )

and

−s − y · ∇ (x )
(x )

=

for almost all x ∈ K .
Since |Su K| = |K|, it follows from (3.4) and (3.6), that

x · νSu K (x) dHn−1 (x)

This and a glance at definition (2.1), gives (3.5), and thus (3.3) is proved.
Suppose that φ is strictly convex and
Su Πφ∗ K = Πφ∗ (Su K).

(3.7)

For each y ∈ K that is sufficiently close to the origin, there exist real ty and sy , with ty = −sy ,
such that
h(Πφ K; y , ty ) = 1

and h(Πφ K; y , −sy ) = 1;

(3.8)

and (y , −sy ) ∈ ∂Πφ∗ K.

(3.9)

or equivalently by (1.8)
(y , ty ) ∈ ∂Πφ∗ K
By Lemma 1.1, (3.7) and (3.8) forces
1
1
h Πφ Su K; y , ty + sy
2

= 1.

(3.10)

Now (3.10) forces equality in (3.6). The strict convexity of φ and the equality conditions of
(1.1) now show that

−ty − y · ∇ (x )
,
(x )

(3.11b)

for almost all x ∈ K . Let y = 0 and note from (3.9) that s0 = 0 and t0 = 0. Observe that the
denominators in (3.11) are strictly positive for almost all x ∈ K , and by solving (3.11) we see
that
(x ) =

(x ),

for almost all x ∈ K ; i.e.,
( − )(x ) − x · ∇( − )(x ) = 0
for almost all x ∈ K . But the fact that
(3.11) shows that

(x ) =

(3.12)

(x ), for almost all x ∈ K , together with

(ty − sy ) − y · ∇( − )(x ) = 0,

(3.13)

for almost all x ∈ K . However (3.13) says that, for some null set N ⊂ K
∇( − )(x ): x ∈ K \ N
is a set of points that must lie in a plane of Rn−1 with normal vector y . But y can be chosen in
any direction in Rn−1 , so there exists an xo ∈ Rn−1 with
∇( − )(x ): x ∈ K \ N

= xo .

Substituting this into (3.12) shows that
( − )(x ) = x · xo
for almost all x ∈ K and hence for all x ∈ K . This shows that the midpoints of the chords of
K parallel to en ,
x,

1
1
(x ) − (x ) : x ∈ K ,
2
2

lie in the subspace {(x , 12 xo · x ): x ∈ Rn−1 } of Rn .

✷

The observation (1.18), the continuity of Πφ∗ : Kno → Kno , and the fact that every convex body
has a boundary that is line free in almost all directions (1.19), allows us to conclude from Proposition 3.1:

E. Lutwak et al. / Advances in Mathematics 223 (2010) 220–242

239

Corollary 3.1. If φ ∈ C, and K ∈ Kno , then
Su Πφ∗ K ⊆ Πφ∗ (Su K),
for all u ∈ S n−1 .
To establish the equality conditions of our theorem we will make use of the following classical characterization of ellipsoids centered at the origin: A convex body K ∈ Kno is an ellipsoid
centered at the origin if and only if there exists a dense set D of directions in S n−1 such that for
each u ∈ D, the midpoints of the chords of K parallel to u lie in a subspace of Rn .
Theorem 3.1. Suppose φ ∈ C. If K ∈ Kno , then the volume ratio
Πφ∗ K /|K|
is maximized when K is an ellipsoid centered at the origin. If φ ∈ Cs , then ellipsoids centered at
the origin are the only maximizers.
Proof. Suppose φ ∈ Cs and K is not an ellipsoid centered at the origin. Choose a direction u
in which ∂K is line free and for which the chords of K (in direction u) have midpoints which
do not lie in a subspace of Rn . Let K1 = Su K. From Proposition 3.1 and the fact that Steiner
symmetrization leaves volume unchanged, it follows that
Πφ∗ K < Πφ∗ K1

with |K| = |K1 |.

Choose a sequence of line-free directions {ui } such that the sequence defined by Ki+1 =
Sui Ki , converges to cB, where c > 0. Here we are using (1.19) together with the fact (see [4])
that a dense set of directions is sufficient to Steiner transform any convex body into a ball. But
Proposition 3.1 and the continuity of Πφ∗ : Kno → Kno can now be used to conclude that
Πφ∗ K < Πφ∗ K1

···

Πφ∗ Ki → Πφ∗ cB ,

with |Ki+1 | = |Ki | = · · · = |K1 | = |K| and thus |K| = |cB|, since Ki → cB. From (2.6) we
know that Πφ∗ cB = c Πφ∗ B and from this we have
|Πφ∗ K|
|K|

<

|Πφ∗ B|
|B|

.

For φ ∈ C that is not necessarily strictly convex, use the same argument — but now with a
first step that results in an inequality that is not necessarily strict. ✷
4. Open problems
The equality conditions in Theorem 3.1 were only established under the assumption that φ is
strictly convex. Was this restriction necessitated by our methods?

240

E. Lutwak et al. / Advances in Mathematics 223 (2010) 220–242

Conjecture 4.1. Suppose φ ∈ C. If K ∈ Kno , then the volume ratio
Πφ∗ K /|K|
is maximized only when K is an ellipsoid.
For φ ∈ C and K ∈ Kno , the Orlicz centroid body Γφ K of K is defined in [48] as the convex
body whose support function at x ∈ Rn is given by
h(Γφ K; x) = inf λ > 0:

1
|K|

φ

1
x · y dy
λ

1 ,

K

where the integration is with respect to Lebesgue measure in Rn .
In [48] the following Orlicz version of the Busemann–Petty centroid inequality is established.
Orlicz Busemann–Petty centroid inequality. If φ ∈ C and K ∈ Kno then the volume ratio
|Γφ K|/|K|
is minimized if and only if K is an ellipsoid centered at the origin.
A technique introduced in [35] shows that once the Petty projection inequality has been established one can easily derive the Busemann–Petty centroid inequality as a consequence. Is there
a simple path from the Orlicz Petty projection inequality to the Orlicz Busemann–Petty centroid
inequality?
