Abstract
The concept of representing a polytope that is associated with some
combinatorial optimization problem as a linear projection of a higherdimensional polyhedron has recently received increasing attention. In
this paper (written for the newsletter Optima of the Mathematical Optimization Society), we provide a brief introduction to this topic and sketch
some of the recent developments with respect to both tools for constructing such extended formulations as well as lower bounds on their sizes.

Introduction

Linear Programming based methods and polyhedral theory form the backbone
of large parts of Combinatorial Optimization. The basic paradigm here is to
identify the feasible solutions to a given problem with some vectors in such a
way that the optimization problem becomes the problem of optimizing a linear
function over the finite set X of these vectors. The optimal value of a linear
function over X is equal to its optimal value over the convex hull conv(X) =
{ x∈X λx x :
x∈X λx = 1, λ ≥ O} of X. According to the Weyl–Minkowski
Theorem [35, 27], every polytope (i.e., the convex hull of a finite set of vectors) can be written as the set of solutions to a system of linear equations and
inequalities. Thus one ends up with a linear programming problem.
As for the maybe most classical example, let us consider the set M(n) of all
matchings in the complete graph Kn = (Vn , En ) on n nodes (where a matching
is a subset of edges no two of which share a common end-node). Identifying
every matching M ⊆ En with its characteristic vector χ(M ) ∈ {0, 1}En (where
χ(M )e = 1 if and only if e ∈ M ), we obtain the matching polytope
Pmatch (n) = conv{χ(M ) : M ∈ M(n)} .
In one of his seminal papers, Edmonds [14] proved that Pmatch (n) equals the
n
set of all x ∈ RE
+ that satisfy the inequalities x(δ(v)) ≤ 1 for all v ∈ Vn and

x(En (S)) ≤ |S|/2 for all subsets S ⊆ Vn of odd cardinality 3 ≤ |S| ≤ n (where
δ(v) is the set of all edges incident to v, En (S) is the set of all edges with both
end-nodes in S, and x(F ) = e∈F xe ). No inequality in this system, whose size
is exponential in n, is redundant.
The situation is quite similar for the permutahedron Pperm (n), i.e., the convex hull of all vectors that arise from permuting the components of (1, 2, . . . , n).
Rado [31] proved that Pperm (n) is described by the equation x([n]) = n(n + 1)/2
and the inequalities x(S) ≥ |S|(|S| + 1)/2 for all ∅ = S
[n] (with [n] =
{1, . . . , n}), none of the 2n − 2 inequalities being redundant. However if for
each permutation σ : [n] → [n] we consider the corresponding permutation matrix y ∈ {0, 1}n×n (satisfying yij = 1 if and only if σ(i) = j) rather than
the vector (σ(1), . . . , σ(n)), we obtain a much smaller description of the resulting polytope, since, according to Birkhoff [8] and von Neumann [34], the
convex hull Pbirk (n) (the Birkhoff-Polytope) of all n × n-permutation matrices is equal to the set of all doubly-stochastic n × n-matrices (i.e., nonnegative
n × n-matrices all of whose row- and column sums are equal to one). It is easy
to see that the permutahedron Pperm (n) is a linear projection of the Birkhoffn
polytope Pbirk (n) via the map defined by p(y)i = j=1 jyij . Since, for every
n
linear objective function vector c ∈ R , we have max{ c, x : x ∈ Pperm (n)} =
n
n
max{ i=1 j=1 jci yij : y ∈ Pbirk (n)}, one can use Pbirk (n) (that can be described by the n2 nonnegativity-inequalities) instead of Pperm (n) (whose description requires 2n −2 inequalities) with respect to linear programming related
issues.
In general, an extension of a polytope P ⊆ Rn is a polyhedron Q ⊆ Rd
(i.e., an intersection of finitely many affine hyperplanes and halfspaces) together
with a linear projection p : Rd → Rn satisfying P = p(Q). Any description
of Q by linear equations and linear inequalities then (together with p) is an
extended formulation of P . The size of the extended formulation is the number
of inequalities in the description. Note that we neither account for the number
of equations (we can get rid of them by eliminating variables) nor for the number
of variables (we can ensure that there are not more variables than inequalities
by projecting Q to the orthogonal complement of its lineality space, where the
latter is the space of all directions of lines contained in Q). If T ∈ Rn×d is the
matrix with p(y) = T y, then, for every c ∈ Rn , we have max{ c, x : x ∈ P } =
max{ T t c, y : y ∈ Q}.
In the example described above, Pbirk (n) thus provides an extended formulation of Pperm (n) of size n2 . It is not known whether one can do something
similar for the matching polytopes Pmatch (n) (we will be back to this question
in Section 4.2). However there are many other examples of nice and small extended formulations for polytopes associated with combinatorial optimization
problems. The aim of this article (that has appeared in [1]) is to show a few
of them and to shed some light on the geometric, combinatorial and algebraic
background of this concept that recently has received increased attention. The
presentation is not meant to be a survey (for this purpose, we refer to Vanderbeck and Wolsey [33] as well as to Cornu´ejols, Conforti, and Zambelli [12]) but

2

rather an appetizer for investigating alternative possibilities to express combinatorial optimization problems by means of linear programs.
While we will not be concerned with practical aspects here, extended formulations have also proven to be useful in computations. You can find more on this
in Laurence Wolsey’s discussion column in [1]. Fundamental work with respect
to understanding the concept of extended formulations and its limits has been
done by Mihalis Yannakakis in his 1991-paper Expressing Combinatorial Optimization Problems by Linear Programs [36] (see Sect. 3.3 and 4). He discusses
some of his thoughts on the subject in another discussion column in [1].

2.1

Some Examples
Spanning Trees

The spanning tree polytope Pspt (n) associated with the complete graph Kn =
(Vn , En ) on n nodes is the convex hull of all characteristic vectors of spanning
trees, i.e., of all subsets of edges that form connected and cycle-free subgraphs.
In another seminal paper, Edmonds [15] proved that Pspt (n) is the set of all
n
x ∈ RE
+ that satisfy the equation x(En ) = n−1 and the inequalities x(En (S)) ≤
|S| − 1 for all S ⊆ Vn with 2 ≤ |S| < n. Again, none of the exponentially many
inequalities is redundant.
However, by introducing additional variables zv,w,u for all ordered triples
(v, w, u) of pairwise different nodes meant to encode whether the edge {v, w}
is contained in the tree and u is in the component of w when removing {v, w}
from the tree, it turns out that the system consisting of the equations x{v,w} −
zv,w,u − zw,v,u = 0 and x{v,w} + u∈[n]\{v,w} zv,u,w = 1 (for all pairwise different v, w, u ∈ Vn ) along with the nonnegativity constraints and the equation
x(En ) = n − 1 provides an extended formulation of Pspt (n) of size O(n3 ) (with
orthogonal projection to the space of x-variables). This formulation is due to
Martin [25] (see also [36, 12]). You will find an alternative one in Laurence
Wolsey’s discussion column below.

2.2

Disjunctive Programming

If Pi ⊆ Rn is a polytope for each i ∈ [q], then clearly P = conv(P1 ∪ · · · ∪ Pq ) is
a polytope as well, but, in general, it is difficult to derive a description by linear
equations and inequalities in Rn from such descriptions of the polytopes Pi .
However constructing an extended formulation for P in this situation is very
simple. Indeed suppose that each Pi is described by a system Ai x ≤ bi of fi linear inequalities (where, in order to simplify notation, we assume that equations
are written, e.g., as pairs of inequalities). Then the system Ai z i ≤ λi bi for all
q
i ∈ [q], i=1 λi = 1, λ ≥ O with variables z i ∈ Rn for all i ∈ [q] and λ ∈ Rq
is an extended formulation for P of size f1 + · · · + fq + q, where the projection
is given by (z 1 , . . . , z q , λ) → z 1 + · · · + z q . This has been proved first by Balas
(see, e.g., [4]), even for polyhedra that are not necessarily polytopes (where in

3

this general case P needs to be defined as the topological closure of the convex
hull of the union).

2.3

Dynamic Programming

When a combinatorial optimization problem can be solved by a dynamic programming algorithm, one often can derive an extended formulation for the associated polytope whose size is roughly bounded by the running time of the
algorithm.
A simple example is the 0/1-Knapsack problem, where we are given a nonnegative integral weight vector w ∈ Nn , a weight bound W ∈ N, and a profit
vector c ∈ Rn , and the task is to solve max{ c, x : x ∈ F (w, W )} with
F (w, W ) = {x ∈ {0, 1}n : w, x ≤ W }. A classical dynamic programming
algorithm works by setting up an acyclic directed graph with nodes s = (0, 0),
t, and (i, ω) for all i ∈ [n], ω ∈ {0, 1, . . . , W } and arcs from (i, ω) to (i , ω )
if and only if i < i and ω = ω + wi , where such an arc would be assigned
length ci , as well as arcs from all nodes to t (of length zero). Then solving the
0/1-Knapsack problem is equivalent to finding a longest s-t-path in this acyclic
directed network, which can be carried out in linear time in the number α of
arcs.
The polyhedron Q ⊆ Rα
+ of all s-t-flows of value one in that network equals
the convex hull of all characteristic vectors of s-t-paths (due to the total unimodularity of the node-arc incidence matrix), thus it is easily seen to be mapped to
the associated Knapsack-polytope Pknap (w, W ) = conv(F (w, W )) via the projection given by y → x, where xi is the sum of all components of y indexed by
arcs pointing to nodes of type (i, ). As Q is described by nonnegativity constraints, the flow-conservation equations on the nodes different from s and t and
the equation ensuring an outflow of value one from s, these constraints provide
an extended formulation for Pknap (w, W ) of size α.
However quite often dynamic programming algorithms can only be formulated as longest-paths problems in acyclic directed hyper graphs with hyperarcs
of the type (S, v) (with a subset S of nodes) whose usage in the path represents
the fact that the optimal solution to the partial problem represented by node v
has been constructed from the optimal solutions to the partial problems represented by the set S. Martin, Rardin, and Campbell [26] showed that, under the
condition that one can assign appropriate reference sets to the nodes, also in
this more general situation nonnegativity constraints and flow-equations suffice
to describe the convex hull of the characteristic vectors of the hyperpaths. This
generalization allows one to derive polynomial size extended formulations for
many of the combinatorial optimization problems that can be solved in polynomial time by dynamic programming algorithms.

2.4

Others

A common generalization of the techniques to construct extended formulations
by means of disjunctive programming or dynamic programming is provided by
4

branched polyhedral systems (BPS ) [21]. In this framework, one starts from an
acyclic directed graph that has associated with each of its non-sink nodes v a
polyhedron in the space indexed by the out-neighbors of v. From these building
blocks, one constructs a polyhedron in the space indexed by all nodes. Under
certain conditions one can derive an extended formulation for the constructed
polyhedron from extended formulations of the polyhedra associated with the
nodes.
Some very nice extended formulations have recently been given by Faenza,
Oriolo, and Stauffer [17] for stable set polytopes of claw-free graphs. Here
the crucial step is to glue together descriptions of stable set polytopes of certain
building block graphs by means of strip compositions. One of their constructions
can be obtained by applying the BPS-framework, though apparently the most
interesting one they have cannot.
An asymptotically smallest possible extended formulation of size O(n log n)
for the permutahedron Pperm (n) has been found by Goemans [19]. His construction relies on the existence of sorting networks of size r = O(n log n) (Ajtai, Koml´
os, and Szemer´edi [2]), i.e., sequences (i1 , j1 ), . . . , (ir , jr ) for which
the algorithm that in each step s swaps elements ais and ajs if and only if
ais > ajs sorts every sequence (a1 , . . . , an ) ∈ R into non-decreasing order. The
construction principle of Goemans has been generalized to the framework of
reflection relations [22], which, for instance, can be used to obtain small extended formulations for all G-permutahedra of finite reflection groups G (see,
e.g., Humphreys [20]), including extended formulations of size O(log m) of regular m-gons, previously constructed by Ben-Tal and Nemirovski [7]. Another
application of reflection relations yields extended formulations of size O(n log n)
for Huffman-polytopes, i.e., the convex hulls of the leaves-to-root-distances vectors in rooted binary trees with n labelled leaves. Note that linear descriptions
of these polytopes in the original spaces are very large, rather complicated, and
unknown (see Nguyen, Nguyen, and Maurras [28]).
The list of combinatorial problems for which small (and nice) extended formulations have been found comprises many others, among them perfect matching polytopes of planar graphs (Barahona [6]), perfectly matchable subgraph
polytopes of bipartite graphs (Balas and Pulleyblank [5]), stable-set polytopes
of distance claw-free graphs (Pulleyblank and Shepherd [30]), packing and partitioning orbitopes [16], subtour-elimination polytopes (Yannakakis [36] and, for
planar graphs, Rivin [32], Cheung [10]), and certain mixed-integer programs
(see, e.g., Conforti, di Summa, Eisenbrand, and Wolsey [13]).

Combinatorial, Geometric, and Algebraic Background
Face Lattices

Any intersection of a polyhedron P with the boundary hyperplane of some affine
halfspace containing P is called a face of P . The empty set and P itself are
5

considered to be (non-proper) faces of P as well. For instance, the proper faces
of a three-dimensional polytope are its vertices, edges, and the polygons that
make up the boundary of P . Partially ordered by inclusion, the faces of a
polyhedron P form a lattice L(P ), the face lattice of P . The proper faces that
are maximal with respect to inclusion are the facets of P . Equivalently, the
facets of P are those faces whose dimension is one less than the dimension of P .
An irredundant linear description of P has exactly one inequality for each facet
of P .
If Q ⊆ Rd is an extension of the polytope P ⊆ Rn with a linear projection p :
d
R → Rn , then mapping each face of P to its preimage in Q under p defines
an embedding of L(P ) into L(Q). Figure 3.1 illustrates this embedding for the
trivial extension Q = {y ∈ RV+ :
x∈X yx = 1} of P = conv(X) via p(y) =

suggests, constructing a small extended formulation for a polytope P means to
hide the facets of P in the fat middle part of the face lattice of an extension
with few facets.

3.2

Slack Representations

Let P = {x ∈ A : Ax ≤ b} ⊆ Rn be a polytope with affine hull A = aff(P ),
A ∈ Rm×n , and b ∈ Rm . The affine map ϕ : A → Rm with ϕ(x) = b − Ax (the
slack map of P w.r.t. Ax ≤ b) is injective. We denote its inverse (the inverse
slack map) on its image, the affine subspace A˜ = ϕ(A) ⊆ Rm , by ϕ˜ : A˜ → A.

6

The polytope P˜ = A˜ ∩ Rm
+ , the slack-representation of P w.r.t. Ax ≤ b, is
isomorphic to P with ϕ(P ) = P˜ and ϕ(
˜ P˜ ) = P .
m
If Z ⊆ R+ is a finite set of nonnegative vectors whose convex conic hull
m
˜
˜
ccone(Z) = { z∈Z λz z : λ ≥ O} ⊆ Rm
+ contains P = A ∩ R+ , then we have
P˜ = A˜ ∩ ccone(Z), and thus, the system z∈Z λz z ∈ A˜ and λz ≥ 0 (for all
z ∈ Z) provides an extended formulation of P of size |Z| via the projection
λ → ϕ(
˜ z∈Z λz z). Let us call such an extension a slack extension and the
set Z a slack generating set of P (both w.r.t. Ax ≤ b).
Now suppose conversely that we have any extended formulation of P of size q
defining an extension Q that is pointed (i.e., the polyhedron Q does not contain
a line). As for polytopes above (which in particular are pointed polyhedra),
˜ ⊆ Rq of Q and the corresponding
we can consider a slack representation Q
˜ Then we have ϕ(p(ψ(
˜ Q)))
˜
inverse slack map ψ.
= P˜ , where p is the projection
map of the extension. If the system Ax ≤ b is binding for P , i.e., each of its
inequalities is satisfied at equation by some point from P , then one can show
(by using strong LP-duality) that there is a nonnegative matrix T ∈ Rm×q
with
+
˜
˜
˜
˜
ϕ(p(ψ(˜
z ))) = T z˜ for all z˜ ∈ Q, thus P = T Q. Hence the columns of T form a
slack generating set of P (w.r.t. Ax ≤ b), yielding a slack extension of size q. As
every non-pointed extension of a polytope can be turned into a pointed one of
the same size by projection to the orthogonal complement of the lineality space,
we obtain the following result, where the extension complexity of a polytope P
is the smallest size of any extended formulation of P .
Theorem 1 ([18]) The extension complexity of a polytope P is equal to the
minimum size of all slack extensions of P .
As every slack extension of a polytope is bounded (and since all bounded polyhedra are polytopes), Theorem 1 implies that the extension complexity of a
polytope is attained by an extension that is a polytope itself. Furthermore,
in Theorem 1 one may take the minimum over the slack extensions w.r.t. any
fixed binding system of inequalities describing P . In particular, all these minima
concide.

3.3

Nonnegative Rank

Now let P = conv(X) = {x ∈ aff(P ) : Ax ≤ b} ⊆ Rn be a polytope with
some finite set X ⊆ Rn and A ∈ Rm×n , b ∈ Rm . The slack matrix of P
[m]×X
with Φi,x = b − Ai, , x . Thus the slack
w.r.t. X and Ax ≤ b is Φ ∈ R+
representation P˜ ⊆ Rm of P (w.r.t. Ax ≤ b) is the convex hull of the columns
[m]×[f ]
of Φ. Consequently, if the columns of a nonnegative matrix T ⊆ R+
form
[f ]×X
a slack generating set of P , then there is a nonnegative matrix S ∈ R+
with
Φ = T S. Conversely, for every factorization Φ = T S of the slack matrix into
[m]×[f ]
[f ]×X
and S ∈ R+
, the columns of T form
nonnegative matrices T ∈ R+
a slack generating set for P .
Therefore constructing an extended formulation of size f for P amounts to
finding a factorization of the slack matrix Φ = T S into nonnegative matrices T
7

with f columns and S with f rows. In particular, we have derived the following
result that essentially is due to Yannakakis [36] (see also [18]). Here, the nonnegative rank of a matrix is the minumum number f such that the matrix can
be written as a product of two nonnegative matrices, where the first one has f
columns and the second one has f rows.
Theorem 2 The extension complexity of a polytope P is equal to the nonnegative rank of its slack matrix (w.r.t. any set X and binding system Ax ≤ b with
P = conv(X) = {x ∈ aff(P ) : Ax ≤ b}).
Clearly, the nonnegative rank of a matrix is bounded from below by its usual
rank as known from Linear Algebra. There is also quite some interest in the
nonnegative rank of (not necessarily slack) matrices in general (see, e.g., Cohen
and Rothblum [11]).

4.1

Fundamental Limits
General Lower Bounds

Every extension Q of a polytope P has at least as many faces as P , as the face
lattice of P can be embedded into the face lattice of Q (see Sect. 3.1). Since each
face is the intersection of some facets, one finds that the extension complexity
of a polyhedron with β faces is at least log β (the binary logarithm of β). This
observation has first been made by Goemans [19] in order to argue that the
extension complexity of the permutahedron Pperm (n) is at least Ω(n log n).
Suppose that Φ = T S is a factorization of a slack matrix Φ of the polytope P
into nonnegative matrices T and S with columns t1 , . . . , tf and rows s1 , . . . , sf ,
f
respectively. Then we can write Φ = i=1 ti si as the sum of f nonnegative
matrices of rank one. Calling the set of all non-zero positions of a matrix its
support, we thus find that the nonnegative factorization Φ = T S provides a
way to cover the support of Φ by f rectangles, i.e., sets of the form I × J,
where I and J are subsets of the row- and column-indices of Φ, respectively.
Hence, due to Theorem 2, the minimum number of rectangles by which one can
cover the support of Φ yields a lower bound (the rectangle covering bound ) on
the extension complexity of P (Yannakakis [36]). Actually, the rectangle covering bound dominates the bound discussed in the previous paragraph [18]. As
Yannakakis [36] observed furthermore, the logarithm of the rectangle covering
bound of a polytope P is equal to the nondeterministic communication complexity (see, e.g., the book of Kushilevitz and Nisan [24]) of the predicate on
the pairs (v, f ) of vertices v and facets f of P that is true if and only if v ∈ f .
One can equivalently describe the rectangle covering bound as the minimum
number of complete bipartite subgraphs needed to cover the vertex-facet-nonincidence graph of the polytope P . A fooling set is a subset F of the edges
of this graph such that no two of the edges in F are contained in a complete
bipartite subgraph. Thus every fooling set F proves that the rectangle covering
bound, and hence, the extension complexity of P , is at least |F |. For instance,

8

for the n-dimensional cube it is not too difficult to come up with a fooling set
of size 2n, proving that for a cube one cannot do better by allowing extended
formulations for the representation. For more details on bounds of this type we
refer to [18].
Unfortunately, all in all the currently known techniques for deriving lower
bounds on extension complexities are rather limited and yield mostly quite
unsatisfying bounds.

4.2

The Role of Symmetry

Asking, for instance, about the extension complexity of the matching polytope
Pmatch (n) defined in the beginning, one finds that not much is known. It might
be anything between quadratic and exponential in n. However, in the main part
of his striking paper [36], Yannakakis established an exponential lower bound
on the sizes of symmetric extended formulations of Pmatch (n). Here, symmetric
means that the extension polyhedron remains unchanged when renumbering the
nodes of the complete graph, or more formally that, for each permutation π of
the edges of the complete graph that is induced by a permutation of its nodes,
there is a permutation κπ of the variables of the extended formulation that maps
the extension polyhedron to itself such that, for every vector y in the extended
space, applying π to the projection of y yields the same vector as projecting
the vector obtained from y by applying κπ . Indeed, many extended formulations are symmetric in a similar way, for instance the extended formulation of
the permutahedron by the Birkhoff-polytope mentioned in the Introduction as
well as the extended formulation for the spanning tree polytope discussed in
Section 2.1.
In order to state Yannakakis’ result more precisely, denote by M (n) the set
of all matchings of cardinality in the complete graph with n nodes, and by
Pmatch (n) = conv{χ(M ) : M ∈ M (n)} the associated polytope. In particular,
Pmatch
n/2 (n) is the perfect-matching-polytope (for even n).
Theorem 3 (Yannakakis [36]) For even n, the size of every symmetric exn
tended formulation of Pmatch
n/2 (n) is at least Ω( (n−2)/4 ).
match
(n), one easily derives the
Since Pmatch
n/2 (n) is (isomorphic to) a face of P
above mentioned exponential lower bound on the sizes of symmetric extended
formulations for Pmatch (n) from Theorem 3.
At the core of his beautiful proof of Theorem 3, Yannakakis shows that, for
even n, there is no symmetric extended formulation in equation form (i.e., with
n
equations and nonnegativity constraints only) of Pmatch
n/2 (n) of size at most k
with k = (n − 2)/4 . From such a hypothetical extended formulation EF1 ,
he first constructs an extended formulation EF2 in equation form on variables
yA for all matchings A with |A| ≤ k such that the 0/1-vector valued map s
on the vertices of Pmatch
n/2 (n) defined by s (χ(M ))A = 1 if and only if A ⊆ M
is a section of EF2 , i.e., s (x) maps every vertex x to a preimage under the
projection of EF2 that is contained in the extension polyhedron. Then it turns

9

out that an extended formulation like EF2 cannot exist. In fact, for an arbitrary
partitioning of the node set into two parts V1 and V2 with |V1 | = 2k + 1, one
can construct a nonnegative point y in the affine hull of the image of s (thus
y is contained in the extension polyhedron of EF2 that is defined by equations
and nonnegativity constraints only) with y{e} = 0 for all edges e connecting V1
and V2 , which implies that the projection of the point y violates the inequality
x(δ(V1 )) ≥ 1 that is valid for Pmatch
n/2 (n) (since |V1 | = 2k + 1 is odd). The crucial
ingredient for constructing EF2 from EF1 is a theorem of Bocherts’ [9] stating
that every subgroup G of permutations of m elements that is primitive with
|G| > m!/ (m + 1)/2 ! contains all even permutations. Yannakakis constructs a
section s for EF1 for that he can show—by exploiting Bochert’s theorem—that
there is a nonnegative matrix C with s(χ(M )) = C · s (χ(M )) for all M ∈
Mn/2 (n), which makes it rather straight forward to construct EF2 from EF1 .
With respect to the fact that his proof yields an exponential lower bound
only for symmetric extended formulations, Yannakakis [36] remarked “we do not
think that asymmetry helps much” in constructing small extended formulations
of the (perfect) matching polytopes and stated as an open problem to “prove
that the matching (. . . ) polytopes cannot be expressed by polynomial size LP’s
without the symmetry assumption”. As indicated above, today we still do not
know whether this is possible. However, at least it turned out recently that
requiring symmetry can make a big difference for the smallest possible size of
an extended formulation.
Theorem 4 ([23]) All symmetric extended formulations of Pmatch
log n (n) have
Ω(log n)
size at least n
, while there are polynomial size non-symmetric extended
match
formulations for Pmatch
log n (n) (i.e., the extension complexity of P log n (n) is bounded from above by a polynomial in n).
Thus, at least when considering matchings of size log n instead of perfect
(or arbitrary) matchings, asymmetry indeed helps much.
While the proof of the lower bound on the sizes of symmetric extended
formulations stated in Theorem 4 is a modification of Yannakakis’ proof indicated above, the construction of the polynomial size non-symmetric extended
formulation of Pmatch
log n (n) relies on the principle of disjunctive programming
(see Section 2.2). For an arbitrary coloring ζ of the n nodes of the complete
graph with 2k colors, we call a matching M (with |M | = k) ζ-colorful if, in
each of the 2k color classes, there is exactly one node that is an end-node of
one of the edges from M . Let us denote by Pζ the convex hull of the characteristic vectors of ζ-colorful matchings. The crucial observation is that Pζ
can be described by O(2k + n2 ) inequalities (as opposed to Ω(2n ) inequalities
needed to describe the polytope associated with all matchings, see the Introduction). On the other hand, according to a theorem due to Alon, Yuster, and
Zwick [3], there is a family of q such colorings ζ1 , . . . , ζq with q = 2O(k) log n
such that, for every 2k-element subset W of the n nodes, in at least one of
the colorings the nodes from W receive pairwise different colors. Thus we have
Pmatch
(n) = conv(Pζ1 ∪ · · · ∪ Pζq ), and hence (as described in Section 2.2) we
k
10

obtain an extended formulation of Pmatch
(n) of size 2O(k) n2 log n, which, for
k
k = log n , yields the upper bound in Theorem 4.
Yannakakis [36] moreover deduced from Theorem 3 that there are no polynomial size symmetric extended formulations for the traveling salesman polytope
(the convex hull of the characteristic vectors of all cycles of lengths n in the
complete graph with n nodes). Similarly to Theorem 4, one can also prove that
there are no polynomial size symmetric extended formulations for the polytopes
associated with cycles of length log n , while these polytopes nevertheless have
polynomially bounded extension complexity [23].
Pashkovich [29] further extended Yannakakis’ techniques in order to prove
that every symmetric extended formulation of the permutahedron Pperm (n) has
size at least Ω(n2 ), showing that the Birkhoff-polytope essentially provides an
optimal symmetric extension for the permutahedron.

Conclusions

Many polytopes associated with combinatorial optimization problems can be
represented in small, simple, and nice ways as projections of higher dimensional
polyhedra. Moreover, though we have not touched this topic here, sometimes
such extended formulations are also very helpful in deriving descriptions in the
original spaces. What we currently lack are on the one hand more techniques to
construct extended formulations and on the other hand a good understanding
of the fundamental limits of such representations. For instance, does every
polynomially solvable combinatorial optimization problem admit an extended
formulation of polynomial size? We even do not know this for the matching
problem. How about the stable set problem in perfect graphs? The best upper
bound on the extension complexity of these polytopes for graphs with n nodes
still is nO(log n) (Yannakakis [36]).
Progress on such questions will eventually shed more light onto the principle
possiblities to express combinatorial problems by means of linear constraints.
Moreover, the search for extended formulations yields new modelling ideas some
of which may prove to be useful also in practical contexts. In any case, work on
extended formulations can lead into fascinating mathematics.
