Introduction
Expander graphs are highly connected sparse ﬁnite graphs which play a basic
role in various areas of computer science. A huge amount of research has been
devoted to them in the computer science literature in the last four decades. (An
excellent survey of these directions is [HLW].) But they also attracted the attention
of mathematicians: their existence follows easily by random considerations (`
a la
Erd˝os), but explicit constructions, which are very desirable for applications, are
much more diﬃcult. Various deep mathematical theories have been used to give

explicit constructions, e.g., the Kazhdan property (T ) from representation theory
of semisimple Lie groups and their discrete subgroups, the Ramanujan Conjecture
(proved by Deligne) from the theory of automorphic forms, and more. All of these
led to fascinating connections between pure mathematics and computer science and
between pure mathematicians and computer scientists. For the ﬁrst three decades—
until approximately ten years ago—essentially all these connections went in one
direction: methods of pure mathematics have been used to solve some problems
arising from computer science (these are summarized in [L1] for example).
Something diﬀerent has emerged in the last decade: computer science pays its
debt to pure mathematics! The notion of expander graphs is starting to play a
signiﬁcant role in more and more areas of pure mathematics.
The goal of this article is to describe expander graphs and their applications
in pure and applied mathematics. Rather than competing with the award winning manuscripts [L1] and [HLW] (the Ferran Sunyer i Balaguer prize and the Levi
Conant prize, respectively), we will emphasize new directions: applications of expanders in pure mathematics. We will try to avoid repeating topics from [L1] and
[HLW], though some intersection is unavoidable, especially in the ﬁrst sections. The
reader is strongly encouraged to consult these manuscripts for more background,
as well as [LZu].
The article is organized as follows. We start with basic deﬁnitions of expander
graphs, their properties, their eigenvalues, and random walks on them. In the
second section we will give various examples, mainly of Cayley graphs, which are
expanders. The reader should not be misled by this section’s modest title, “examples”. Some of the most remarkable developments in recent years are described
there, e.g., the fact that all non-abelian ﬁnite simple groups are expanders in a uniform way and the result that congruence quotients of linear groups form a family
of expanders. The last result is the crucial ingredient in some of the applications
to number theory and to group theory.
Section 3 deals with applications to computing. Many are described in [HLW],
so we chose to give a theoretical application to the product replacement algorithm
and one for error correcting codes.
Section 4 deals with applications to number theory. There are several of these,
but we will mainly describe a new direction of research for which the use of expanders is a dominant factor: the aﬃne sieve. This method enables us to study
primes and almost primes in orbits of groups acting on Zn . This is a far-reaching
extension to a non-commutative world of Dirichlet’s theorem about primes in arithmetic progression. This direction of research arose in response to the dramatic
developments concerning Cayley graphs being expanders. It also sheds new light
on classical subjects such as Apollonian circle packing and more.
The aﬃne sieve method can also be modiﬁed to give a group sieve, which is a
method to study various group-theoretical properties of generic elements in ﬁnitely
generated groups. This method gives some new results about linear groups and the
mapping class groups. These are described in Section 5.
Section 6 is devoted to applications to geometry. Most of the applications are
for hyperbolic manifolds with some special attention to hyperbolic 3-manifolds.
In Section 7, we collected brief remarks on several topics which should ﬁt into
this article but for various reasons were left out.

We hope that the current notes will provide a panoramic view of the broad
scope of mathematics which is connected with expander graphs. They have truly
expanded into many diﬀerent areas of mathematics!
This paper is dedicated to the memory of Jonathan Rogawski, an insightful
mathematician, a loyal friend, and a wonderful human being. Jon helped me a
lot when I took my ﬁrst steps into the world of automorphic forms and generously
contributed to [L1]. His friendship will be deeply missed.
1. Expander graphs
Expander graphs are highly connected sparse graphs. This property can be
viewed from several diﬀerent angles: eigenvalues, random walks, representation
theory (if the graph is a Cayley graph), geometry, and more. In this section we
brieﬂy review these aspects (sending the reader to [L1] for a more comprehensive
description). This leads to the highly relevant property (τ ), described in §1.6, which
will play a very important role in the sections to come.
1.1. The basic deﬁnition. Let X be a ﬁnite graph on a set V of n vertices and
A = AX its adjacency matrix, i.e., A is an n × n matrix, where Ai,j is the number
of edges between vertex i and vertex j. So usually Ai,j = 0 or 1, but we also allow
multiple edges (Aij > 1) or loops (Aii > 0). The graph X is k-regular if the valency
of every vertex is k, i.e., for every i, nj=1 Aij = k.
Deﬁnition 1.1. For 0 < ε ∈ R, X is an ε-expander if for every subset Y of V with
n
|Y | ≤ 12 |V | = , |∂Y | ≥ ε|Y |,
2
where ∂Y is the boundary of Y , i.e., the set of vertices in V which are connected
to (some vertices of) Y but are not in Y .
The largest ε for which X is an ε-expander will be denoted by ε(X).
One easily sees that X is connected. So being an ε-expander for “large” ε (well,
it is clear that ε cannot be larger than 1) means that X is “very much connected”.
In most applications (real world applications as well as pure mathematical applications) what one wants is to ﬁnd regular graphs with large n (say n → ∞), ﬁxed
k (as small as possible), and a ﬁxed ε (as large as possible). A family of k-regular
graphs will be called a family of expanders or an expanding family if all of them
are ε-expanders for the same ε > 0.
The ﬁrst to deﬁne expander graphs was Pinsker [Pin] in 1973 who also coined the
name. Recently, it has been noticed by Larry Guth that slightly earlier, Kolmogorov
and Barzdin [KB] discussed a property of graphs which is equivalent to expanders.
While Pinsker deﬁned and studied expanders for their use in computer science
(error correction codes, communication networks, and algorithms) Kolmogorov and
Barzdin’s motivation was very diﬀerent: they studied the network of nerve cells of
the human brain. This brought them to the question of realizing various networks
in R3 and this way to graphs in which any two subsets have a large number of edges
between them, a property which characterizes expanders (see [HLW, §2.4], and the
historical notes in [GrGu]).
When k is ﬁxed, ε (the expansion constant) is closely related to the isoperimetric
constant h(X), also called the Cheeger constant.

116

Deﬁnition 1.2. For X as above, let
h(X) :=

min

V =Y1 ˙ Y2

|E(Y1 , Y2 )|
,
min((|Y1 |, |Y2 |)

where the minimum runs over all the ways to write V as a disjoint union of two
subsets Y1 and Y2 , and E(Y1 , Y2 ) is the set of edges between Y1 and Y2 .
The following is a straightforward corollary of the deﬁnitions:
Proposition 1.3.
h(X)
≤ ε(X) ≤ h(X).
k
1.2. Eigenvalues, random walks, and Ramanujan graphs. Let X be as before, a k-regular graph on n vertices. As X is undirected, A = AX is a symmetric
matrix with real eigenvalues. One can think of A as a linear operator on L2 (X),
the real (or complex) functions on V , where for i ∈ V and f ∈ L2 (X),
n

(Af )(i) =

Aij f (j),
j=1

i.e., summing f on the neighbors. An easy argument shows that k is the largest
eigenvalue of A (corresponding to the constant functions) and all the eigenvalues
λ0 = k ≥ λ1 ≥ · · · ≥ λn−1 of AX lie in the interval [−k, k]. The following are some
well-known easy properties:
Proposition 1.4. (a) X is connected iﬀ λ1 < λ0 = k.
(b) X is bipartite iﬀ λn−1 = −k.
Thus various combinatorial/geometric properties of X can be recovered from its
spectrum (eigenvalues). This is also true of the expansion property:
Proposition 1.5.
k − λ1
≤ h(X) ≤ (k + λ1 )(k − λ1 ).
2
So for k-regular graphs (ﬁxed k), being ε-expanders is equivalent to a spectral
gap λ1 < k − ε .
This proposition is now well known and is attributed to various authors (see [L1]
for more details and references about this result and others in this section).
For the original deﬁnition of an expander, one needs to bound the largest eigenvalue λ1 = λ1 (X) of X which is smaller than k. But for various other applications
what is most relevant is
λ(X) := max{|λ| λ an eigenvalue of A and |λ| = k},
i.e., the largest eigenvalue in absolute value other than ±k. This is not a crucial
diﬀerence, but some care is needed as some authors deﬁne expanders by a bound
on λ(X).
For many applications the bound on the eigenvalues is even more relevant than
the original deﬁnition since the eigenvalues control the random walk on X. Namely,
assume μ ∈ L2 (X) is a probability measure on V , i.e., 0 ≤ μ(i) ≤ 1 for every i ∈ V
n
and i=1 μ(i) = 1. Then if a “little person” is in vertex i at step t with probability
μ(i) and he walks a step over a randomly chosen edge coming out of i, then at
= X = k1 AX is the
step t + 1 he will be in k1 Aμ. In other words, the matrix

EXPANDER GRAPHS IN PURE AND APPLIED MATHEMATICS

bistochastic transition matrix of the Markov chain that is the random walk on X.
If X is connected and not bipartite, then the random walk converges to the uniform
distribution u, i.e., u(i) = n1 for every i ∈ V . The rate of convergence depends on
λ(X) := max{|λ| |λ| = k,

λ an eigenvalue of A}.

More precisely (cf. [HLW, Theorem 3.3]),
Proposition 1.6. Let X be a non-bipartite k-regular graph with adjacency matrix
A and normalized one Δ = k1 A. Then for any distribution μ on the vertices of X
and any 1 ≤ t ∈ N,
λ(X) t
Δt μ − u L2 ≤
k
when u is the uniform distribution.
The non-bipartite issue is not crucial and can be avoided by considering the
“lazy random walk”; cf. [LP]. One can also get similar types of bounds with the
L1 -norm which is sometimes more relevant; see [HLW, §3.1].
There is a limit to what one can expect when trying to bound λ(X). This is
given by the Alon-Boppana result:
Proposition 1.7. Let Xn,k be an inﬁnite family of k-regular
√ connected graphs on
n vertices where k is ﬁxed and n → ∞. Then λ(Xn,k ) ≥ 2 k − 1 − o(1).
This suggests the following deﬁnition:
Deﬁnition
1.8. A k-regular ﬁnite graph X is called a Ramanujan graph if λ(X) ≤
√
2 k − 1.
So, Ramanujan graphs are, in some sense, optimal expanders. The most general
known result gives for every k of the form pα + 1, where p is a prime and α ∈ N,
an inﬁnite family of k-regular Ramanujan graphs ([Mo], [LSV2]; see also [LPS1],
[LPS2], [M2], [M3], and [Va2]). We mention in passing that for every k which is
not of this form, it is not known if such an inﬁnite family exists. The ﬁrst open
case is k = 7.
1.3. Cayley graphs and representation theory. A particularly nice way to
construct graphs which are very symmetric is via Cayley graphs. Recall that if
G is group and Σ a symmetric subset of G (i.e., s ∈ Σ iﬀ s−1 ∈ Σ), the Cayley
graph Cay(G; Σ) of G w.r.t. Σ is the graph whose vertex set is G and a ∈ G is
connected to {sa|s ∈ Σ}. This is a k-regular graph with k = |Σ|. It is connected iﬀ
Σ generates G.
The expansion properties of Cay(G; Σ) can be reformulated in representationtheoretic terms. To this end, let us deﬁne:
Deﬁnition 1.9. Let G be a group, and let Σ be a subset of G. We say that ε > 0 is
a Kazhdan constant of G w.r.t. Σ if for every unitary representation ρ : G → U (H),
where H is a Hilbert space and U (H) the group of unitary operators, without a nonzero ﬁxed vector, and for every 0 = v ∈ H, there exists s ∈ Σ such that ρ(s)v −v
≥ε v .
One can see that in this case Σ generates G.
Deﬁnition 1.10. A discrete group Γ is said to have the Kazhdan property (T ) if
it has some ﬁnite set of generators Σ with Kazhdan constant ε > 0.

118

ALEXANDER LUBOTZKY

One can prove that if this happens for one Σ, it is so for any set of generators,
with possibly diﬀerent ε .
The Kazhdan constant is another way to express the expansion of Cayley graphs.
Proposition 1.11. (i) For every 0 < ε ∈ R, there exists ε = f1 (ε ) > 0 s.t. if
G is a ﬁnite group with a symmetric set of generators Σ and Kazhdan constant ε ,
then ε(Cay(G; Σ)) ≥ ε, i.e., Cay(G; Σ) is an ε-expander.
(ii) For every k ∈ N and every 0 < ε ∈ R, there exists ε = f2 (k, ε) such that if
G is a ﬁnite group with a symmetric set Σ of k generators with ε(Cay(G; Σ)) ≥ ε,
then ε = f2 (k, ε) is a Kazhdan constant for G w.r.t. Σ.
So, at least as long as k is ﬁxed, the expansion constant and the Kazhdan
constant are closely related. Assume now that Γ is an inﬁnite group generated by
a ﬁnite symmetric set Σ and assume that L = {Ni }i∈I is an inﬁnite collection of
ﬁnite index normal subgroups of Γ. We can deduce from Proposition 1.11:
Proposition 1.12 ([M1]). If Γ has the Kazhdan property (T ), i.e., there exists
ε > 0 which is a Kazhdan constant of Γ w.r.t. Σ, then all the ﬁnite quotients
Cay(Γ/Ni ; Σ), i ∈ I, are ε-expanders, where ε > 0 depends only on ε .
The fact that there are groups with property (T ) is a non-trivial result due
originally to Kazhdan (see §2.2 below for more). For example, Γ = SL3 (Z), the
integral 3 × 3 matrices of determinant 1 is such a group and so the Cayley graphs
of its quotients SL3 (Z/mZ), m ∈ N, form a family of ε-expanders w.r.t. a ﬁxed set
of generators coming from SL3 (Z), e.g., {A±1 , B ±1 }, where
A=

110
010
001

and

B=

0 10
0 01
1 00

.

We will come back to many more examples of this kind in Section 2. Here we
only observe that in order to deduce the conclusion of Proposition 1.12, we need a
weaker property than (T ), the so-called (τ ). Due to its importance we will give the
deﬁnition, repeating the notation again:
Deﬁnition 1.13. Let Γ be a group, with a collection L = {Ni }i∈I of ﬁnite index
normal subgroups. We say that Γ has property (τ ) w.r.t. L if there exists a
symmetric subset Σ of Γ and an 0 < ε ∈ R such that for every ﬁnite quotient
Gi = Γ/Ni , i ∈ I, ε is a Kazhdan constant for Gi with respect to Σ (or more
precisely w.r.t. ΣNi /Ni ). An equivalent way to say it is that for every unitary
representation ρ : Γ → U (H), with Kerρ ⊃ Ni for some i, without a non-zero ﬁxed
vector, and every 0 = v ∈ H, there exists s ∈ Σ such that ρ(s)v − v > ε v . If
L is the family of all ﬁnite index normal subgroups of Γ, we simply say that Γ has
property (τ ).
The equivalence of Proposition 1.11 shows:
Proposition 1.14. The group Γ has property (τ ) w.r.t. L = {Ni }i∈I if and only
if there exists a symmetric subset Σ of Γ and ε > 0, such that all the Cayley graphs
Cay(Γ/Ni ; Σ) are ε-expanders.
There exist groups (e.g., Γ = SL2 (Z[ p1 ])) which have (τ ) but not (T ) while
Γ = SL2 (Z) has neither (T ) nor (τ ), but it has (τ ) w.r.t. the family
L = {Γ(m) = Ker SL2 (Z) → SL2 (Z/mZ) }m∈N ,
the family of congruence subgroups; see §2.4 below.

Some of the recent breakthroughs are far-reaching extensions of this last fact;
extensions which have some remarkable applications.
1.4. Expanders and Riemannian manifolds. Let M be an n-dimensional connected closed Riemannian manifold (i.e., compact with no boundary; much of the
theory can be extended to a more general setting but for simplicity of the exposition
we will stick to the closed case). Let Δ = −div(grad) be the Laplacian operator of
L2 (M ). Its eigenvalues 0 = λ0 (M ) < λ1 (M ) ≤ λ2 (M ) ≤ · · · form a discrete subset
(with multiplicities) of R+ , called the spectrum of M .
The spectrum of M is very much related to the geometry of M and these relations
are the subject of spectral geometry. A more intuitive description of Δ is given by
the formula,
f
2n
Sr
− f (p) ,
(Δf )(p) = lim 2
r→0 r
vol(Sr )
where n = dim M, p ∈ M, f ∈ L2 (M ), and Sr is the sphere of radius r around p.
This description is similar to the combinatorial Laplacian as an averaging operator,
as described in §1.2.
We will mainly be interested in λ1 (M ), which can be described directly without
a reference to Δ.
Proposition 1.15.
λ1 (M ) = inf

Another important geometric invariant of M , whose connection with expanders
is even more evident, is the Cheeger constant:
Deﬁnition 1.16. The Cheeger constant h(M ) is
h(M ) = inf
E

μ(E)
,
min(ν(A), ν(B))

where E runs over all the compact (n − 1)-dimensional submanifolds of M which
divide M into disjoint submanifolds A and B. Here μ(E) is the area of E, and ν is
the volume form of M .
Just as for graphs, h(M ) is closely related to λ1 (M ). In fact, historically the
relation between the expansion/Cheeger constant and λ1 was discovered ﬁrst for
manifolds and only later on for graphs; see [L1] for historical notes.
Theorem 1.17 (Cheeger’s inequality). λ1 (M ) ≥

h2 (M )
.
4

Buser proved a converse to this inequality, which depends on the Ricci curvature
R(M ). We will not bother deﬁning it here, but rather send the reader to [Bu], [L1]
and the references therein. But let us quote:
Theorem 1.18. If R(M ) ≥ −(n − 1)a2 for some a ≥ 0, where n = dim M , then
λ1 (M ) ≤ 2a(n − 1)h(M ) + 10h2 (M ).
What is important for us is that in the case of a bounded Ricci curvature, which
will hold in all our considerations, λ1 (M ) is also bounded above by a function of
h(M ).
The more precise connection between these notions and expander graphs will be
given in Theorem 1.20 below. Let us point out here the basic intuition:

120

ALEXANDER LUBOTZKY

˜ be the universal cover of M, Γ = π1 (M ) the fundamental group of
Let M
˜ , i.e., F is an open
M , and F a fundamental domain for the action of Γ on M
˜ , whose closure F¯ is compact and such that ΓF¯ = M
˜ and for every
subset of M
1 = γ ∈ Γ, γ(F¯ ) ∩ F¯ ⊆ F¯ F . Standard covering theory shows that the ﬁnite set
Σ = {γ ∈ Γ γ F¯ ∩ F¯ is of codimension 1} is a symmetric set of generators for Γ.
One can visualize Cay(Γ; Σ) in the following way: Fix x0 ∈ F and put a vertex at
the interior point γx0 of the tesselate γF of F (naturally this vertex will represent
γ; note that γ is unique for the given tesselate). Now, draw an edge between γ1 x0
and γ2 x0 if γ1 F ∩ γ2 (F ) is of codimension 1. One can easily check that what we
˜.
get is exactly a “drawing” of Cay(Γ; Σ) on M
Moreover, if Γ1 is a normal subgroup of Γ of ﬁnite index, then the “projection”
˜ /Γ1 is exactly the Cayley graph Cay(Γ/Γ1 ; Σ).
of the above graph to M1 = M
We therefore get that the combinatorial graphs Cay(Γ/Γ1 ; Σ) when Γ1 runs over
the ﬁnite index normal subgroups of Γ are “approximations” of the ﬁnite sheeted
normal covers of M .
This enables us to relate the expansion properties of these Cayley graphs to
the asymptotic expansion of h(M1 ) and similarly with λ1 of the graphs and of the
manifolds; see Theorem 1.20 below.
1.5. Expanders and measure theory. Let G be a compact group. A mean m
on G is a linear functional m : L∞ (G) → R satisfying:
(i) m(f ) ≥ 0 if f ≥ 0;
(ii) m(χG ) = 1, where χG is the constant function 1 on G.
We say that it is a G-invariant mean if it also satisﬁes:
(iii) m(g.f ) = m(f ) for every g ∈ G and f ∈ L∞ (G), where g.f (x) = f (g −1 x),
i.e., G-left invariant.
An example of an invariant mean is the Haar measure of G, which is also countably additive on subsets of G. In general, it is possible for G to have invariant
means diﬀerent than the (unique) Haar measure. For example, G = S 1 (the circle)
has such means. But:
Theorem 1.19 ([Sh1]). Let Γ be a ﬁnitely generated group, and let L = {Ni }i∈N
be a decreasing chain of ﬁnite index normal subgroups of Γ. Let G = lim←− Γ/Ni
i∈N

be the proﬁnite completion of Γ w.r.t. L. Then the following are equivalent:
(i) Γ has (τ ) w.r.t. L.
(ii) The Haar measure on G is the only Γ-invariant mean on G.
So, we also have a measure-theoretic characterization of property (τ ).

1.6. A summary of property (τ ). Let Γ be a ﬁnitely generated group generated
by a ﬁnite symmetric set Σ. Let L = {Ni }i∈N be a decreasing chain of ﬁnite index
normal subgroups of Γ.
Theorem 1.20. The following conditions are equivalent:
(i) Γ has property (τ ) w.r.t. L; i.e., there exists ε1 > 0 s.t. if ρ : Γ → U (H) is a
unitary representation of Γ on a Hilbert space H without non-zero ρ(Γ) ﬁxed
points and such that Ker(ρ) ≥ Ni for some i, then for every 0 = v ∈ H, there
exists s ∈ Σ with ρ(s)v − v ≥ ε1 v .
(ii) There exists ε2 > 0 such that all the Cayley graphs Cay(Γ/Ni ; Σ) are ε2 expanders.

EXPANDER GRAPHS IN PURE AND APPLIED MATHEMATICS

121

(iii) There exists ε3 > 0 such that h(Cay(Γ/Ni ); Σ)) ≥ ε3 (see Deﬁnition 1.2).
(iv) There exists ε4 > 0 such that λ1 (Cay(Γ/Ni ; Σ)) ≤ k − ε4 for every i ∈ N,
where k = |Σ|.
ˆ L = lim Γ/Ni is the only Γ-invariant mean on L∞ (Γ
ˆ L ).
(v) The Haar measure of Γ
←−

If in addition Γ = π1 (M ) for some closed Riemannian manifold M , and
{Mi }i∈N are the ﬁnite sheeted Galois covers of M corresponding to {Ni }i∈N ,
then we also have
(vi) There exists ε5 > 0 such that h(Mi ) ≥ ε5 (see Deﬁnition 1.16) for every
i ∈ N.
(vii) There exists ε6 > 0 such that λ1 (Mi ) ≥ ε6 for every i ∈ N (see Proposition
1.15).
The equivalence of all the properties except for (v) can be found in [L1, Theorem
4.3.2]. For (v) see [Sh1].
So property (τ ) can be seen and expressed in many ways: combinatorial, representation theoretic, geometric and measure theoretic. This is what makes it so
useful in a variety of applications as we will see in the next sections.
2. Examples of expanders
It is by no means clear that expander graphs exist, though it is not diﬃcult to
prove their existence by random considerations. Various deep mathematical tools
have been used to give explicit constructions (Kazhdan property (T ), Ramanujan
Conjecture, etc.) We review these brieﬂy here (again, more details can be found
in [L1] and the references therein). Most of the current section is devoted to a
description of the two important developments of the last decade:
(1) All non-abelian ﬁnite simple groups are expanders in a uniform way.
(2) Many linear groups have property (τ ) with respect to congruence subgroups.
The second result has important applications to number theory, group theory,
and geometry, which will be described in later sections.
2.1. Random graphs and the Zig-Zag construction. It is relatively easy to
show that for a ﬁxed k ≥ 3 there exists an ε > 0 s.t. a random (n, k)-graph, i.e., a
k-regular graph on n vertices, is an ε-expander with probability tending to 1 as n
goes to inﬁnity. The subtle issue (which we will ignore here) is how to describe a
good model of random (n, k)-graphs. Anyway, this has been known for many years
(see [L1] and §1.1 above). More recently a much deeper result (Alon’s conjecture)
has been proved by Friedman [Fr].
Theorem 2.1. For every ε > 0 and k ≥ 3,
√
Prob λ(X) ≤ 2 k − 1 + ε = 1 − on (1)
when X is a random (n, k)-graph; i.e., almost every such X is almost Ramanujan.
It is interesting to repeat here the open question mentioned in §1.2, whether for
every k ≥ 3 there exist inﬁnitely many Ramanujan graphs. While Theorem 2.1
hints toward a positive answer, it by no means implies that. Moreover, one may
be tempted to conjecture, following Theorem 2.1, that almost every (n, k)-graph is
Ramanujan. But quite a lot of computational data suggests the contrary, namely
that the probability of a k-regular graph on n vertices to be Ramanujan tends,

122

ALEXANDER LUBOTZKY

when n → ∞, to some constant strictly between 0 and 1. We do not know any
result or even a conjecture that predicts what is this interesting number.
Of course, for many applications one wants explicit constructions. A lot of work
has been dedicated to this goal, and various deep methods have been used. In a
breakthrough paper, Reingold, Vadhan, and Wigderson [RVW] showed that there
is an elementary combinatorial way to build expanders via the Zig-Zag product of
graphs, which they introduced. We describe this subject here very brieﬂy sending
the reader to [RVW] for details (or to [HLW] for a very clear exposition).
The Zig-Zag product is a method that, given two graphs X and Y , where X
is an (n, m) graph (i.e., m-regular graph on n vertices) and Y an (m, d)-graph,
produces X ◦ Y , an (mn, d2 )-graph. (This is not a commutative operation.) In
[RVW], it is shown that one can bound the “spectral gap” of X ◦ Y by the spectral
gaps of X and Y . They then start, for a small ﬁxed integer d, with a (d4 , d)-graph
X = X0 with a good spectral gap (such a graph can be found by an exhaustive
search in constant time) and deﬁne by induction X1 = X 2 and Xn+1 = (Xn )2 ◦ X
for n ≥ 1. (If Y is a graph, we denote Y 2 to be the graph with the same vertex set
as Y , putting an edge between the endpoints of any path of length 2 in the original
graph.) Note that Xn is a (d4n , d2 )-graph, so the family {Xn }∞
n=1 is a family of
d2 -regular graphs (independent on n). Induction and the spectral control give that
this is a family of expanders.
This construction turns out to be quite useful in various applications in computer
science, sometimes giving better results than using the expanders constructed by
the other methods. Still, as far as we know, it has not been used for applications
in pure mathematics, which is our main interest in these notes. For the kind of
applications we emphasize here, one usually needs expanders which are Cayley
graphs (or at least somewhat symmetric). The Zig-Zag product has something to
say about Cayley graphs of semidirect products of groups (see [ALW], [MW] and
especially [RSW]), but one still needs the other approaches. These will be described
in the next subsections.
2.2. Kazhdan property (T ) and ﬁnite simple groups. The seminal work of
Kazhdan [Ka] on property (T ) of high-rank simple Lie groups and their lattices (=
discrete subgroups of ﬁnite covolume) opened the door for Margulis to give the ﬁrst
explicit examples of expanders. Let us repeat what we already said in §1.3.
Proposition 2.2. Let Γ be a group with property (T ) generated by a ﬁnite symmetric set Σ, and let L = {N N Γ, [Γ : N ] < ∞} be the family of ﬁnite index
normal subgroups of Γ. Then there exists an ε > 0 such that all Cay(Γ/N ; Σ) are
ε-expanders.
So, the issue (which is non-trivial) is to show that such Γ’s exist. This was done
by Kazhdan and has been generalized substantially in recent years:
Theorem 2.3. Let G be a simple Lie group (e.g., G = SLn (R)) of R-rank ≥ 2
(e.g., n ≥ 3). If Γ is a lattice in G (e.g., Γ = SLn (Z)), then Γ has property (T ).
Theorem 2.3 combined with Proposition 2.2 gives:
Corollary 2.4. For a ﬁxed n and a ﬁxed ﬁnite symmetric set of generators Σ
of SLn (Z), the Cayley graphs Cay(SLn (Z/pZ), Σ) are all k-regular ε-expanders for
k = |Σ| and some ε = ε(n, Σ) > 0.

SLn (Z/pZ) or more precisely PSLn (Z/pZ), the quotient by the center, is the
prototype of ﬁnite simple groups of Lie type. Many more inﬁnite families of ﬁnite
simple groups can be deduced, by a similar method, to be expanders. But a more
challenging conjecture was put forward in 1989 by Babai, Kantor, and Lubotzky
[BKL]:
Conjecture 2.5. There exist k ∈ N and ε > 0 such that every non-abelian ﬁnite
simple group G has a symmetric set of generators Σ of size ≤ k such that Cay(G; Σ)
is an ε-expander.
For a number of years this conjecture has been open and even some suspicion
arose (including by some of its proposers) that perhaps it is not true and expansion
is a property restricted to “bounded rank”. But it turned out that this conjecture is
true, and it is now fully proved, and its proof required an ensemble of very diﬀerent
methods. The big breakthrough came with two works of Kassabov [K1] and [K2]
([K1] was very much inﬂuenced by [KN], which in turn was modeled on [Sh3]).
Rather than being loyal to the historical development, let us start with an even
more recent result (which was inﬂuenced by [KN]). To state the result, we ﬁrst
need a deﬁnition. Let R be a ring with an identity. For n ≥ 3, deﬁne En (R) to
be the multiplicative subgroup of the ring of n × n matrices Mn (R) generated by
Eij (r) for all 1 ≤ i = j ≤ n and r ∈ R, where Eij (r) is the n × n matrix with ones
on the diagonal, r at the (i, j)-entry, and zero otherwise. For many commutative
rings, En (R), at least for n ≥ 3, is nothing more than SLn (R). The groups En (R)
play an important role in algebraic K-theory.
If R is a ﬁnitely generated ring, then En (R) is a ﬁnitely generated group (for
n ≥ 3). We can now state:
Theorem 2.6 (Ershov and Jaikin-Zapirain [EJ]). Let R be the free ring R =
Z x1 , . . . , xr in the non-commutative free variables x1 , . . . , xr . Then for every
n ≥ 3, En (R) has the Kazhdan property (T ).
Kassabov’s basic idea was to use such a result (well, he proved a weaker version
of it, which was suﬃcient) to deduce:
Corollary 2.7. There exist k ∈ N and ε > 0 such that for every n ∈ N and
every prime power q ∈ N, the group SLn (Fq ) has a set Σ of k generators for which
Cay(SLn (Fq ), Σ) is an ε-expander. Here, Fq is the ﬁeld with q elements.
Indeed, take R = Z x1 , x2 . It is easy to see that Mn (Fq ) is a (ﬁnite) quotient
of R. Thus by Theorem 2.6 and Proposition 2.2,
Im E3 (R) → E3 (Mn (Fq )
are expanders. But this latter group is
E3 Mn (Fq ) = SL3n (Fq ).
Now it is not diﬃcult to deduce that SLn (Fq ) are expanders in a uniform way
(i.e., with the same k and ε for all q and for all n ≥ 3) since SL3n+1 (Fq ) and
SL3n+2 (Fq ) are bounded products of copies of SL3n (Fq ):
Deﬁnition 2.8. Let A = {Ai }i∈I and B = {Bj }j∈J be two families of ﬁnite groups.
We say that B is a bounded product of A if there exists a constant m ∈ N such that
for every Bj ∈ B, there exist Ai1 , . . . , Aim in A and homomorphisms ϕit : Ait → B
such that B is the product (just as a set) ϕi1 (Ai1 ) · . . . · ϕim (Aim ).

ALEXANDER LUBOTZKY

The following easy lemma is very useful:
Lemma 2.9. In the notation above, if A are expanders in a uniform way (i.e.,
same k and ε) and B is a bounded product of A, then B are also expanders in a
uniform way (for some k and ε which depend on k and ε).
The next theorem says that we can go much further than SLn :
Theorem 2.10 (Nikolov [Ni], Lubotzky [L6]). Let
A = {SLn (Fq ) n ≥ 2, q prime power}
and let B be the family of all simple groups of Lie type excluding the Suzuki groups.
Then B is a bounded product of A.
One can check in the proof that if one allows the use of only SLn with n ≥ 3,
the result remains true for those groups in B of rank ≥ 14. Thus Conjecture 2.5 is
valid for these groups. To handle all ﬁnite simple groups of Lie type, one should
handle SL2 (Fq ). This will be done in §2.4 by a completely diﬀerent method. With
the above results this will ﬁnish all groups of Lie type except the Suzuki groups.
They will be handled in §2.6 again by a completely diﬀerent method. But now we
will consider ﬁrst the case of symmetric and alternating groups, which is of special
interest.
2.3. The symmetric groups. Making the symmetric groups (or equivalently the
alternating groups) into a family of expanders in a uniform way has been a challenging problem for almost two decades, until it was solved by Kassabov [K2].
Theorem 2.11. There exists k ∈ N and 0 < ε ∈ R such that for every n ≥ 5, Sym(n)
has a symmetric generating subset Σ with |Σ| ≤ k for which Cay(Sym(n); Σ) is an
ε-expander.
The same result holds also with Alt(n), the alternating group, instead of Sym(n).
It suﬃces to prove the theorem for one of these two cases.
Now, one can show that while Alt(n) contains many copies of groups of Lie type
it is not a bounded product of such groups, so the results of the previous section
do not suﬃce. Still Kassabov looked at n’s of the form n = d6 for d = 23r − 1 for
some r ∈ N. Based on ideas similar to the ones in the previous section, he showed
5
that the groups Δr = SL3r (F2 )d are ε0 -expanders w.r.t. generating sets F of size
at most 40. He then embedded Δr in Alt(n) in six diﬀerent ways which give six
copies of F in Alt(n). He then showed that Alt(n) are uniformly expanders with
respect to the union of these six sets. It should be stressed that Alt(n) is not a
bounded product of these six copies and the argument is far more involved, working
with the representation-theoretic version of expansion. One should work with the
various irreducible representations of Alt(n), and Kassabov divided them into two
classes, giving diﬀerent arguments according to their Young diagrams. The reader
is referred to [K2] for details and to [KLN] for a sketch of the proof.
2.4. Property (τ ), SL2 , and groups of low rank. As already mentioned in
§1.3, one does not need the full power of property (T ) to deduce that the ﬁnite
quotients of the ﬁnitely generated group Γ give a family of expanders. Property
(τ ) (Deﬁnition 1.13) suﬃces.
The prototype of groups with (τ ) w.r.t. some family is Γ = SL2 (Z).

Let us set some notation: Γ = SL2 (Z) and for m ∈ N, Γ(m) = Ker(SL2 (Z) →
SL2 (Z/mZ))—the congruence subgroup mod m. The group Γ acts on H =
{a + bi|a ∈ R, 0 < b ∈ R} by M¨obius transformations: γ = ab
cd ∈ Γ and z ∈ H,
az+b
then γ(z) = cz+d . The upper half-plane H is endowed with a Riemannian metric
of constant curvature −1. This is the hyperbolic plane. The quotients Γ(m) \ H
are (non-compact) Riemann surfaces of ﬁnite volume.
Theorem 2.12 (Selberg [Sel]). For every m ∈ N, λ1 Γ(m) \ H ≥

3
16 .

Selberg conjectured that 14 is the right lower bound. The current world record
is λ1 ≥ 0.238 due to Kim and Sarnak [Ki].
Anyway, Theorem 1.20 gives:
Corollary 2.13. For a ﬁxed set of generators Σ of Γ = SL2 (Z), e.g., Σ =
1 ±1
1 0
0 1 , ±1 1 , the Cayley graphs Cay SL2 (Z/mZ); Σ are all ε-expanders for
some ε > 0 which may depend on Σ but not on m.
It should be stressed that Γ = SL2 (Z) has negative solutions to the congruence
subgroup problem and it has many more ﬁnite quotients than just SL2 (Z/mZ).
The family of all ﬁnite quotients of Γ does not form a family of expanders. So in
the terminology of Deﬁnition 1.13 above, Γ does not have property (τ ), but it has
property (τ ) w.r.t. the family of congruence subgroups.
The last corollary implies, in particular, that the groups {SL2 (p)|p prime} can
be made into a family of 4-regular Cayley graphs which are expanders uniformly
(i.e., same ε).
Analogous results for arithmetic groups in positive characteristic such as
SL2 (Fp [t]) or SL2 (Fp [t, t−1 ]) (when this time a result of Drinfeld replaces the theorem of Selberg) can make, for a ﬁxed p, the family {SL2 (Fpα ) α ∈ N} into a family
of expanders.
Can we make all of these families together {SL2 (Fpα ) p prime, α ∈ N} into a
family of expanders?
The answer is yes, but the proof is more subtle. See [L6] (and a sketch in [KLN]).
Here we only mention that the proof uses the explicit constructions of Ramanujan
graphs (as a special case of Ramanujan complexes) in [LSV2] (see also [LSV1]). It is
shown there that for a ﬁxed p, SL2 (Fpα ) are (p+1)-regular Ramanujan graphs. The
p + 1 generators involved are the conjugates of a ﬁxed element Cp,α of SL2 (Fpα ) by
a ﬁxed non-split torus T ⊆ SL2 (Fp ) ⊆ SL2 (Fpα ). Then we use the fact that SL2 (p)
1 ±1
1
1
to deduce that SL2 (Fpα )
are expanders with respect to Σ0 =
0 1 , ±1 1
±1
are expanders w.r.t. the symmetric set of six generators Σ0 ∪ {Cp,α
} in a uniform
way. So Selberg’s Theorem and Drinfeld’s solution to the positive characteristic
Ramanujan Conjecture for GL2 are both needed for that goal.
Now all the SL2 (Fpα ) are expanders and so all {SLn (Fpα ) p, n, α ∈ N, p prime}
are expanders in a uniform way (same k, same ε). We can appeal again to Theorem
2.10 and Lemma 2.9 to deduce that all ﬁnite simple groups of Lie type, with the
possible exceptions of the Suzuki groups, are expanders in a uniform way.
Suzuki groups have to be excluded here as they do not contain copies of SLn (Fpα ).
Indeed their order is not divisible by 3. (A classical result of Glauberman in the
early days of the classiﬁcation project of ﬁnite simple groups asserts that this property characterizes them! See [Gl].) But the Suzuki groups are not exceptional for
our problem; i.e., they are also expanders. But this requires another method and
has to wait for §2.7.

2.5. Property (τ ) with respect to congruence subgroups. Selberg’s Theorem
2.12 was a starting point for many works which extended it to general arithmetic
groups. The results are of importance in number theory (automorphic forms),
representation theory, and geometry. In this section, we will describe them from
our perspective.
Let k be a global ﬁeld, i.e., a ﬁnite extension of Q or of Fp (t). Let G be a
simple algebraic group deﬁned over k with a ﬁxed embedding ρ : G → GLn for
some n. Let θ be the ring of integers of k, and let S be a non-empty ﬁnite set
of valuations of k containing S∞ , the set of Archimedean valuations. Let θS =
{x ∈ k v(x) ≥ 0, ∀v ∈
/ S} be the ring of S-integers, so θS = θ if S = S∞ . Let
Γ = ρ G(k) ∩ GLn (θS ). A subgroup of G commensurable with Γ is called an
S-arithmetic subgroup of G. For a non-zero ideal I of θS (which is always of ﬁnite
index) we denote Γ(I) = Ker Γ → GLn (θS /I) . An S-arithmetic subgroup of G
containing Γ(I) for some I is called a (S-) congruence subgroup.
While the deﬁnition of Γ may depend on the choice of the representation ρ, the
classes of arithmetic and congruence subgroups do not.
Deﬁnition 2.14. We say that Γ has the Selberg property if it has property (τ )
with respect to the congruence subgroups {Γ(I)}0=I θS .
Again, if true for Γ, then it is true for all the arithmetic groups in its commensurability class.
The group Γ = G(θS ) sits as an irreducible lattice in the Lie group H =
v∈S G(kv ), where kv is the completion of k w.r.t. v.
Recall that a lattice Λ in H is a discrete subgroup, where Λ \ H carries an Hinvariant ﬁnite measure. It is irreducible if its projection to each proper subproduct
is dense. In many cases, H has Kazhdan property (T ):
Theorem 2.15 (Kazhdan). If kv -rank (G) ≥ 2 for every v ∈ S, then H =
v∈S G(kv ), and all its lattices have property (T ).
For having (τ ) we need less:
Theorem 2.16 (Lubotzky and Zimmer [LZi]). If one of the non-compact factors
of H has property (T ), then all irreducible lattices have property (τ ).
Selberg’s Theorem 2.12 shows that Γ = SL2 (Z), which has neither (T ) nor (τ ),
still has (τ ) w.r.t. congruence subgroups. This has been extended to more general
arithmetic groups. This is the work of many people. The most general method
(and actually also the simplest!) is due to Burger and Sarnak [BS] who proved:
Theorem 2.17. Let L1 ≤ L2 be two non-compact simple Lie groups with arithmetic
lattices Λi ≤ Li , i = 1, 2, and Λ1 = L1 ∩ Λ2 . Then:
(i) If Λ1 has property (τ ), so does Λ2 .
(ii) If Λ1 has the Selberg property, so does Λ2 .
Many (in some sense “most”) simple k-algebraic groups G contain a copy of SL2 ,
so Theorems 2.12 and 2.17 imply the Selberg property for the arithmetic subgroups
of G. By the Galois cohomology method one can classify the arithmetic lattices
for which this method does not apply. These need some other (more diﬃcult)
techniques. This was done by Clozel [Cl] using automorphic forms methods. As a
result it is now known that all arithmetic lattices in semisimple groups over local
ﬁelds of characteristic zero have the Selberg property. As far as we know this has
not been completed yet for the positive characteristic case.

2.6. Sum-products in ﬁnite ﬁelds and expanders. The results described in
the previous section gave a fairly complete picture of the congruence quotients of
an arithmetic group of the form Γ = G(θS ) described there, as being expanders
with respect to generators coming from “the mother group” Γ. For example, the
family
1 0
p prime}
{Cay SL2 (Fp ); 10 ±1
1 , ±1 1
forms a family of ε-expanders for some ε > 0 since 10 11 and 11 01 generate SL2 (Z).
A similar conclusion (for a diﬀerent ε > 0) is true for the family
{Cay SL2 (Fp );

1 ±2
0 1

,

1 0
±2 1

p > 2 prime}

even though Γ is not generated by 10 21 and 12 01 ; these two matrices generate a
ﬁnite index subgroup of Γ, and essentially the same arguments as before also apply
for it.
But now what about
{Cay SL2 (Fp );

1 ±3
0 1

,

1 0
±3 1

p > 3 prime}?

Is this a family of ε-expanders for some ε > 0? The issue here is that the
subgroup Λ = 10 31 , 13 01 is of inﬁnite index in SL2 (Z); still when taken mod p,
the image of Λ generates SL2 (Fp ) for every p > 3. Combinatorially, one should
expect a similar ε-expander conclusion for them, but the methods of the previous
sections do not apply here. This problem was presented in 1992 in [L2] and was
popularized under the nickname (given by Alex Gamburd) the “Lubotzky 1-2-3
problem”.
In fact this 1-2-3 problem is just an attractive special case of a much more general
problem: Let Γ = G(θS ) as in the previous section, but for simplicity of notation,
let us take k = Q, θ = Z, and S = S∞ , so Γ = G(Z), e.g., Γ = SLd (Z). Let Λ
be a ﬁnitely generated subgroup of Γ, generated by a set Σ, which is Zariski dense
in Γ. Note that being dense in the Zariski topology is quite a weak assumption.
For example for Γ = SL2 (Z), every subgroup Λ which is not virtually cyclic, e.g.,
Λ = 10 31 , 13 01 , is Zariski dense. Assume further that G, as an algebraic group,
is connected, simply connected, and simple (e.g., G = SLd ). Then the strong
approximation theorem for linear groups ([MVW], [No], [W], [Pi]; see [LS, Window
9] for an exposition) says that there exists m0 ∈ N such that for every m ∈ N with
(m, m0 ) = 1, the projection of Λ to G(Z/mZ) is onto. In other words, it says that
Cay G(Z/mZ); Σ is a connected graph. Being an expander is a very strong form
of being connected. It thus naturally suggests the question whether these graphs
form a family of ε-expanders. The so-called “Lubotzky 1-2-3 problem” is just a
baby version of this much more general question.
The ﬁrst steps and several interesting partial results toward the 1-2-3 problem
were taken in [Ga1] and [Sh2]. But the main breakthroughs came in recent years,
starting with the work of Helfgott and continued by others. We now turn to describe
these developments.
Let us start by stating the main result of [H1]:
Theorem 2.18. Let G = SL2 (Fp ), and let A be a generating subset of G. Let
0 < δ < 1 be a constant. Then:
(a) If |A| < |G|1−δ , then |A · A · A| ≥ C|A|1+ε , where C and ε depend only on
δ.

128

ALEXANDER LUBOTZKY

(b) If |A| ≥ |G|1−δ , then A · . . . · A = G, i.e., the product of k copies of A is G,
where k depends only on δ.
Before elaborating on its importance for expanders, let us put it in a more general
context.
The sum-product results form a body of various theorems asserting that if F =
Fp is a ﬁnite ﬁeld of a prime order p and A is a subset of Fp , which is not too
large, then either the set of products A · A = {a · b|a, b ∈ A} or the set of sums
A + A = {a + b|a, b ∈ A} is signiﬁcantly larger than A. Here is a typical result in
this area, called also “additive combinatorics” ([TV]).
Theorem 2.19 ([BKT]). If A is a subset of Fp , p prime, with pδ ≤ |A| ≤ p1−δ for
some δ > 0, then |A + A| + |A · A| ≥ c|A|1+ε , where c and ε depend only on δ.
The main idea of Helfgott was to convert the growth of a subset B of SL2 (Fp )
when taking the product B · B · B with the growth of A = tr(B) = {tr(g) g ∈ B}
as a subset of Fp under sums and products. He also showed that the sizes of B
and A can teach a lot about each other. This enabled him to deduce Theorem 2.18
from Theorem 2.19. His work is quite complicated from a technical point of view.
Some subsequent works simpliﬁed and extended his work (see below) and eventually
made the conclusion free of the use of sum-products results. Still, various ideas of
Helfgott are also crucial in those extensions.
An interesting corollary of Theorem 2.18 is that there exists a constant C such
that for every set of generators Σ of SL2 (Fp ),
diam(Cay(SL2 (Fp ); Σ)) ≤ log(p)C .
This was the ﬁrst inﬁnite class of groups for which the following long-standing
conjecture of Babai was proved:
Conjecture 2.20. There exists a constant C, possibly C = 2, such that for every
non-abelian ﬁnite simple group G and for every set of generators Σ, the diameter
is polylogarithmic (i.e., diam Cay(G; Σ)) = O((log |G|)C ).
The example Cay(Sym(n); τ = (1, 2), σ ± = (1, 2, . . . , n)±1 } and similar ones for
Alt(n) show that one cannot expect better than C = 2 (see [L1]).
While Helfgott’s result solved Babai’s conjecture for SL2 (Fp ), it fell short of
showing that these are expanders. (By the way, expanders give rise to logarithmic
diameter, i.e., C = 1 in the last conjecture.) It did not solve the 1-2-3 problem
either. But shortly afterwards Bourgain and Gamburd [BG1] made a second major
breakthrough, establishing the desired expansion by introducing their fundamental
ﬂattening lemma technique and coupling it with more standard techniques from
the representation theory of these ﬁnite simple groups.
Theorem 2.21. For any 0 < δ ∈ R there exists ε = ε(δ) ∈ R such that for every
prime p, if Σ is a set of generators of SL2 (Fp ) such that girth Cay(SL2 (Fp ); Σ) ≥
δ log p, then Cay SL2 (Fp ); Σ is an ε-expander.
The girth of a graph is the length of the shortest non-trivial closed path in the
graph.
This theorem solves, in particular, the 1-2-3 problem: an easy argument (going
back to [M1]) shows that
girth Cay(SL2 (Fp );

1 ±3
0 1

,

1 0
±3 1

) ≥ δ log p

EXPANDER GRAPHS IN PURE AND APPLIED MATHEMATICS

129

for some 0 < δ independent of p. Moreover, if Σ is a free set of generators of a
non-abelian free subgroup of SL2 (Z), then girth Cay(SL2 (Fp ); Σ) is logarithmic
in p and hence these are expanders. In fact, the last conclusion holds for every
Zariski dense subgroup Λ of SL2 (Z) as every such subgroup contains a non-abelian
free group. This is easy for SL2 (Z) but true also for the more general case of Λ,
which concerns us, by a well-known result of Tits [Ti]. It actually implies that we
can assume Λ is a non-abelian free group.
The reader may note that we have stopped discussing general congruence quotients SL2 (Z/mZ) for m ∈ N and stuck to m = p a prime and SL2 (Z/pZ) = SL2 (Fp ).
Well, the extension to general m required more eﬀort. It was ﬁrst done in [BGS2] for
natural numbers m which are square-free and eventually for all m ∈ N in [BV]. We
will come back to this issue later. The case of m square-free is especially important
for the sieve methods in Sections 4 and 5.
The dramatic breakthroughs have continued even further: ﬁrst in parallel by two
groups of researchers Breuillard, Green, and Tao ([BGT1], [BGT2]) and Pyber and
Szab´o ([PS1], [PS2]) and secondly by Varju [V] (followed by [SGV]). The ﬁrst two
groups proved essentially the same result (there are some diﬀerences but for our
impressionistic picture, we can ignore them).
Theorem 2.22. Let r ∈ N be ﬁxed. Then for every ﬁnite simple group G of
Lie type of rank at most r and for every subset A of G which generates G, either
A · A · A = G or |A · A · A| ≥ |A|1+ε , where ε depends only on r.
The reader may check that this generalizes Helfgott’s result (Theorem 2.18)
from SL2 (Fp ) to all ﬁnite simple groups of Lie type of bounded rank. It should be
mentioned that shortly after Theorem 2.18 was proved, it was shown by Nikolov
and Pyber [NiPy] that part (b) of that theorem follows quickly from a result of
Gowers [Go] and in more general situations, i.e., ﬁnite simple groups of Lie rank at
most r with k = 3 for some δ = δ(r) depending only on r. (See [BNP] for more.)
This handles the case of “large subsets”, and the main novelty of Theorem 2.22 is
the case when |A| < |G|1−δ(r) .
Theorem 2.22 extends Helfgott’s result from SL2 to any bounded rank ﬁnite
simple group. In particular it proves the Babai conjecture for this case, namely:
Corollary 2.23. For r ∈ N, there is a constant C = C(r) such that for every ﬁnite
simple group of Lie type G of rank at most r and every symmetric set of generators
Σ of G,
diam Cay(G; Σ) ≤ (log |G|)C .
The conjecture is still open for the unbounded rank case. It should be stressed
that in Theorem 2.22, ε does depend on r. In fact, it is shown in [PS2] that
ε = O( r1 ). Still one can expect that C of Corollary 2.23 is independent of r. For
the bounded rank case one may conjecture that the right bound is C(r)(log |G|)
rather than (log |G|)C(r) ; see more in §2.7.
Helfgott’s result for SL2 led to the Bourgain-Gamburd Theorem 2.21. It naturally suggests that we expect a similar result for bounded rank simple groups. The
following theorem is the second breakthrough (proved ﬁrst in [V] for SLn and later
in [SGV] in general). It is in one way weaker and in another way stronger than the
expected analogue.
Theorem 2.24 (A. Salehi Golseﬁdy and P. Varju [SGV]). Let Γ be a ﬁnitely
generated subgroup of GLn (Q), so Γ ⊆ GLn (ZS ) for some ﬁnite set of primes S.

The “only if” part is easy. The main point is the “if” part. It does not exactly generalize Theorem 2.21 of Bourgain and Gamburd, but rather generalizes
Bourgain, Gamburd, and Sarnak [BGS2], which gives expansion for square-free
congruence quotients, but only for SL2 . As we will see in the next sections, this
is an extremely useful result with important applications to number theory, group
theory, and even geometry. The reader may note that even though we formulated
the result over Q, it holds over any number ﬁeld by restriction of scalars and for
most applications one can reduce anyway to Q.
It will be desirable to know the above result for Γ(q) for all q’s without the
restriction to square-free (see also [BG3] and [BG4]), though at this point we do
not see applications to this more general statement. So far this was proved only
for Γ = SLn (Z) by Bourgain and Varju ([BV] using [BFLM]). One can fantasize
on a much more general statement, which will be the ultimate generalization of the
1-2-3 problem:
Conjecture 2.25. Let Γ be a ﬁnitely generated subgroup of GLn (F ), F a ﬁeld. So,
Γ ⊂ GLn (R), R a ﬁnitely generated domain. Assume H 0 is perfect, where H is the
Zariski closure of Γ and H 0 its connected component. Then Γ has (τ ) w.r.t. to the
family Γ(I) = Ker Γ → GLn (R/I) when I runs over all the ﬁnite index ideals of
R.
A proof of the positive characteristic part of this conjecture will have new applications.
In light of Theorem 2.6 one can even speculate on a more general version of
Conjecture 2.25, but this conjecture is general enough to cover any applications in
sight.
2.7. Random generators and worst-case generators. In Sections 2.2, 2.3, and
2.4 we described how all the non-abelian ﬁnite simple groups, except for the Suzuki
groups, can be made into a family of expanders uniformly. We showed that there
exists k ∈ N and 0 < ε ∈ R such that for every such G there exists an explicitly
given symmetric subset Σ of G of size at most k such that Cay(G; Σ) is an εexpander. We did not bother to write the sets Σ explicitly but the method was
explicit and if one wants, such a Σ can be presented. Now, for the Suzuki groups
such a Σ exists but in a non-explicit way.
Theorem 2.26 (Breuillard, Green, and Tao [BGT3]). There exists an 0 < ε ∈ R
such that for every Suzuki group G = Sz(22 +1 ), for almost every pair of elements
(x, y) ∈ G × G, the Cayley graph Cay(G; {x±1 , y ±1 }) is an ε-expander.
So altogether Conjecture 2.5 is now a theorem! This conjecture handles the
“best-case scenario”; i.e., there exists a set of generators Σ of G with the desired
property. What about random sets for general ﬁnite simple groups?
Recall the well-known result:
Theorem 2.27 ([D], [KL], [LiSh]). Two random elements of a ﬁnite simple group
G generate G with probability going to 1 when |G| is going to inﬁnity.

EXPANDER GRAPHS IN PURE AND APPLIED MATHEMATICS

131

Another way to state the last result is that a random pair of elements gives
rise to a connected Cayley graph. Is this graph an expander? In a more precise
formulation:
Open Problem 2.28. Is there a 0 < ε ∈ R, such that Prob(Cay(G; {x±1 , y ±1 })
is an ε-expander) is going to one when G runs over the non-abelian ﬁnite simple
groups with |G| → ∞ and x and y are chosen randomly and uniformly from G?
It was recently proved by Breuillard, Green, Guralnick, and Tao ([BGGT1],
[BGGT2]) that the answer to this problem is yes if one restricts oneself to groups
of bounded Lie rank. This of course generalizes Theorem 2.26 as well as a similar
result which was known before for SL2 ([BG1] and [Di] using [GHSSV]). It can
replace [L6] as a proof for the bounded case of Conjecture 2.5. (The proof in
[L6] used deep results from automorphic forms such as Selberg’s Theorem and
Drinfeld’s solution to the characteristic p Ramanujan Conjecture, but gave explicit
generators.)
One can ask for even more: Is it possible that there exists ε > 0 such that
Cay(G; {x±1 , y ±1 }) is an ε-expander for every choice of generating set {x, y} for G
and any non-abelian ﬁnite simple group (“worst-case scenario”; compare to Babai
Conjecture 2.20). In the general case the answer is certainly no! The family Alt(n)
has generators which do not give rise to a family of expanders. (For Sym(n) one can
take {τ = (1, 2), σ = (1, 2, . . . , n)}: Cay(Sym(n); {τ, σ ±1}) are not expanders (see
[L1, Example 4.3.3(c)]) and from this one can deduce a similar result for Alt(n).)
It seems likely that for a family of ﬁnite simple groups of unbounded rank, one can
always ﬁnd “worst-case generators” which are not expanders. But one may suggest:
Conjecture 2.29. For every r ∈ N, there exists ε = ε(r) such that
Cay(G; {x±1 , y ±1 })
is an ε-expander for every ﬁnite simple group G of Lie type and rank at most r and
for every generating set {x, y} of G.
One may want to compare Conjecture 2.29 with Corollary 2.23, which gives a
weaker statement. An intermediate step would be to prove that
diam Cay(G; {x±1 , y ±1 }) = Or (log |G|),
where the implied constant depends only on r.
As of now the only result concerning Conjecture 2.29 is:
Theorem 2.30 (Breuillard and Gamburd [BGa]). There exists 0 < ε ∈ R and an
inﬁnite set of primes P such that for every p ∈ P and every generating set {x, y}
of SL2 (Fp ), Cay(SL2 (Fp ); {x±1 , y ±1 }) is an ε-expander.
Their interesting method is not explicit. They prove the existence of such a set
P by a non-eﬀective method.
3. Applications to computer science
Expander graphs play an important role in computer science with numerous
applications in many subareas. They appear as basic building blocks of various
networks, give error correcting codes, are used for derandomization of various probabilistic algorithms, and more. Many of the applications are presented in [HLW],
and the reader is encouraged to consult them, either in detail or at least to get an

132

ALEXANDER LUBOTZKY

impression of the wide spectrum of applications. We chose to present one “real”
application (to error correcting codes) and one theoretical application to the theory
of computation (the analysis of the product replacement algorithm).
3.1. Error correcting codes. Error correcting codes is a collective name for various methods that enable sending messages of information through noisy channels.
The most common model deals with sending a block of k bits of information, i.e.,
a vector v in Fk2 . Instead of v, one sends T v ∈ Fn2 when n > k, i.e., a longer vector,
but with the hope that if the noise will cause t mistakes (i.e., switching 0 to 1 or
vice versa, in t coordinates) the receiver will be able to correct it back to the right
vector. This can happen if for every v1 = v2 ∈ Fk2 , dist(T v1 , T v2 ) > 2t where for
x, y ∈ Fn2 , we take dist(x, y) = the number of bits in which they are diﬀerent.
It is usually convenient to use a linear transformation for T , in which case C :=
T (Fk2 ) is a linear subspace of Fn2 . Moreover, as dist(x, y) = dist(x − y, 0), this code
errors, when d = d(C) = min{dist(x, 0) | 0 = x ∈ C}. This leads
can correct d−1
2
us to deﬁne:
Deﬁnition 3.1. An (n, k, d)-code is a linear subspace C of Fn2 of dimension k of
distance d(C) = d.
In coding theory, one is interested in “good codes”, i.e., a family of (n, k, d)-codes
with dimension k and distance d both growing linearly with n. So let us denote
r(C) = nk and δ(C) = nd , the rate and the relative distance of the code C. So, a
family of codes, of dimensions going to inﬁnity, is good if there exists ε > 0 such
that r(C) and δ(C) are both at least ε.
The subspace C is deﬁned by linear equations. The code (or more precisely the
family of codes) is called LDPC (low density parity check) if for some ﬁxed constant
, all these linear equations are -sparse, i.e., each such equation touches at most
variables. Another way to say this is that the “parity check” matrix H deﬁning C,
i.e., the (n − k) × n matrix H with C = {x ∈ Fn2 | Hx = 0}, has at most non-zero
entries in each of its rows. (Of course, such an H is not unique; we say that C is
LDPC if such an H exists.)
It has been known for a long time that LDPC good codes do exist. This was
ﬁrst shown by random considerations (see [HLW] and the references therein). In
1996, Sipser and Spielman [SiSp] gave an explicit construction based on expander
graphs.
To describe their work, let us start with a simpler construction of codes based
on graphs (sometimes called “cycle graph codes”) as follows:
Let X = (V, E) be a connected r-regular graph on m vertices. So |E| = mr
2 .
E
Let F = F2 and F be the space of functions from E to F. This can be thought
of as the F-vector space with basis E or also as the set of all subsets of E (where
A + B = (A ∪ B)\(A ∩ B)). Let C be the subspace of FE spanned by all cycles of
X. A simple argument shows that if we consider FE as the space of functions, then
f ∈ C iﬀ for every v ∈ V ,
(3.1)

f (e) = 0.
v∈e∈E

(In fact, this is the same argument which enabled Euler to prove that there is
no Eulerian path in K¨
onigsberg; i.e., there is such a path iﬀ the degree of every
vertex is even.) This shows that dim(C) ≥ |E| − |V |. In fact, the sum of all the

EXPANDER GRAPHS IN PURE AND APPLIED MATHEMATICS

133

deﬁning equations is 0 and one can prove that dim(C) = |E| − |V | + 1. Note
that each one of the deﬁning equations (3.1) has support exactly r, so if we take
a family of r-regular graphs, we get a family of LDPS codes with rate = 1 − 2r .
But, unfortunately, for these codes, the distance is logarithmic in the dimension
rather than linear. Indeed, it is easy to see that the distance of this code is exactly
girth(X), the girth of the graph X, i.e., the length of the shortest non-trivial closed
cycle in X. By the well-known and easy Moore inequality, for an r-regular graph
X on n vertices, girth(X) ≤ 2 logr−1 (n), which implies that the cycle code cannot
be good.
To overcome this, Sipser and Spielman used the following idea (which in some
sense goes back to Tanner [Ta]). Choose a “small” code C0 inside Fr with rate r0
and relative distance δ0 . For every v ∈ V , give the edges coming out of v, labels
1, . . . , r, and denote them as ev (1), . . . , ev (k) (we do not require any compatibility
here: the same edge can be labeled i when it comes out of v and j when it comes
out of w). We now deﬁne C(X, C0 ) to be the subspace of all functions f ∈ FE such
that for every v ∈ V , (f (ev (1)), . . . , f (ev (k))) is a vector in C0 . Namely, these are
the functions which are “locally” in C0 , i.e., what every vertex “sees” in its star is
a vector of C0 .
Theorem 3.2 (Sipser and Spielman [SiSp]). The code C(X, C0 ) has relative rate
0 −λ 2
) , where λ = λ(X) =
at least 2r0 − 1 and relative distance at least ( δ1−λ
1
r max{μ | μ an eigenvalue of X, μ = r}.
The theorem gives an explicit construction of√LDPC good codes. Indeed, let X
be an r-regular Ramanujan graph, so λ(X) ≤ 2 rr−1 ≤ √2r . Pick a code C0 in Fr
with rate > 12 and relative distance > √2r . Such codes do exist as can be seen by
either random consideration (and as r is ﬁxed, we are allowed to pick one randomly)
or by one of the many classical methods (note that we only ask the relative distance
to be more than √2r , so it does not have to be “good”). Theorem 3.2 now ensures
that C(X, C0 ) is good. Finally, the code C(X, C0 ) is LDPC since every deﬁning
equation touches only the r edges adjacent to a vertex v (the equations which force
it to be in C0 ).
The proof of Theorem 3.1 is not diﬃcult. As C0 is deﬁned by (1−r0 )r equations,
C = C(X, C0 ) is deﬁned by (1−r0 )rm equations on |F | = rm
2 variables, so dim C ≥

see that the relative distance of C is positive, one uses the following result of Alon
and Chung [AC, Lemma 2.3].

is what one should expect “randomly”.

Assume now that 0 = f ∈ C(X, C0 ) with edge support D. We want to prove
2
that |D| is large. Assume the size of D is rm
2 (γ + λγ(1 − γ)) for some 0 < γ < 1.
Then by the lemma, D touches a set of vertices D0 with at least γm vertices. As
every edge touches two vertices, it means that on the average every vertex of D0

134

sees at most r(γ + λ(1 − γ)) edges. So one of them sees at most this size. But it
sees a vector in C0 whose support is at least δ0 r. Hence γ + λ(1 − γ) ≥ δ0 , which
0 −λ
. Substituting into |D| implies the theorem.
implies γ ≥ δ1−λ
In [KaW] a version of Theorem 3.2 was shown for the case when the graph X is
a Cayley graph of a group, in which case one can get a “symmetric code”. This has
been used in [KaL] to present highly symmetric LDPC good codes. These codes
satisfy all the “gold standards” of coding theory: they have linear dimension (i.e.,
r(C) ≥ ε > 0), linear distance (i.e., δ(C) ≥ ε > 0), they are LDPC, and there exists
a group H acting transitively on the coordinates of Fn2 (i.e., acting on the Cayley
graph which is edge transitive) such that the code C is invariant. Moreover, all the
constraints (≡ equations) deﬁning C are spanned by the orbit of one equation and
this equation is of bounded (≤ r) support.
The key step for the construction of these highly symmetric codes are the edge
transitive Ramanujan graphs constructed in ([LSV2]) as a special case of Ramanujan complexes ([LSV1]).

3.2. The product replacement algorithm. The last three decades have brought
a great interest in computational group theory. This is usually divided in two
directions: one is combinatorial group theory which usually deals with inﬁnite
groups. We will touch upon this direction brieﬂy in §5.1. Here we mainly deal
with the other direction: algorithms dealing with ﬁnite groups such as permutation
groups or groups of matrices over ﬁnite ﬁelds. A typical problem in this theory is of
the following type. Devise an algorithm that when given few explicit permutations
in Sym (n) (or matrices in GLn (Fq )) will ﬁnd various properties of the group G
generated by these elements, such as its order, its composition factors, etc. The
computational theory of permutation groups is very developed where most problems
have deterministic algorithms. On the other hand for matrix groups many of the
practical algorithms are probabilistic.
Probabilistic algorithms very often need (pseudo-) random elements from the
group G. Let us formulate this more formally. We need an algorithm that when
explicit elements g1 , . . . , gk (from a larger group such as Sym (n) or GLn (Fq )) are
given, it will provide us with a “pseudo-random” element from G = g1 , . . . , gk ,
the group generated by g1 , . . . , gk .
One such algorithm is to take a random word of some length in the generators
g1 , . . . , gk and their inverses. This can be visualized as the random walk on the
when one stops after moves. This algoCayley graph Cay G; g1±1 , . . . , gk±1
rithm is a pretty good one if this Cayley graph is an expander, but this is not the
case in general. The reader may think about the case k = 1, in which case G is
cyclic, to see how slow the algorithm is in this case.
A diﬀerent approach was suggested in 1995 in [CLMNO], and it very quickly
became the standard way to generate random elements in ﬁnite groups in the
various packages dealing with group computations such as MAGMA, GAP, etc. It
is called the product replacement algorithm. The easiest way to describe it is also
as a random walk on a graph. This time the vertex set of the graph is Ωr (G) =
{(h1 , . . . , hr ) ∈ Gr | G = h1 , . . . , hr }, i.e., the r-tuples of generators of G. The
edges correspond to the following “moves”.

EXPANDER GRAPHS IN PURE AND APPLIED MATHEMATICS

135

For 1 ≤ i = j ≤ r:
L±
ij

: (h1 , . . . , hi , . . . , hj , . . . , hr ) → h1 , . . . , hi , . . . , h±1
i hj , . . . , hr ,

±
Rij

: (h1 , . . . , hi , . . . , hj , . . . , hr ) → h1 , . . . , hi , . . . , hj h±1
i , . . . , hr .

This makes Ωr (G) into a 4r (r − 1)-regular graph. The algorithm is to take r > k
and a random walk, starting at (g1 , . . . , gk , e, e, . . . , e), of say, steps, then stop
at a vertex of Ωr (G) and pick up one of its coordinates randomly among the r
possibilities. Unlike the previous Cayley graph, this graph is highly non-symmetric
and contains many loops and double edges. The analysis of the algorithm is very
complicated, but many simulations showed outstanding performances. For example
for G = Sym (n), τ = (1, 2) and σ = (1, . . . , n), the ﬁrst algorithm needs (by
theoretical and experimental data) approximately n2 log n steps, so for n = 52
this is over 10,000. At the same time simulations with the product replacement
algorithm for n = 52 and r = 10 showed that after approximately 160 steps one
gets a random-like permutation.
What is needed is a theoretical explanation for these outstanding performances.
The ﬁrst steps in this analysis were taken in [DSC]. A more comprehensive explanation was suggested in [LP]. Here is the crucial observation: Think of L±
ij
±
and Rij
above as acting on the vector (x1 , . . . , xi , . . . , xj , . . . , xr ) of r free generators of the free group Fr on {x1 , . . . , xr }. Let A+ = Aut+ (Fr ) be the subgroup of
A = Aut (Fr ) generated by these elements. By some well-known results, going back
to Nielsen, A+ is a subgroup of index 2 in A. Now, Ωr (G) can be identiﬁed with
the set Epi (Fr , G) of epimorphisms from Fr onto G, where such an epimorphism
ϕ corresponds to (ϕ (x1 ) , . . . , ϕ (xr )). The group Aut (Fr ) acts on Epi (Fr , G) by
α.ϕ = ϕ ◦ α−1 for α ∈ A. One can easily check now that the graph structure of
Ωr (G) deﬁned above is the Schreier graph of Aut (Fr ) acting on the set Ωr (G)
±
w.r.t. the generators L±
ij , Rij . (A Schreier graph of a group H generated by Σ
and acting on a set X is the graph with vertex set X where x ∈ X is connected to
σ.x for σ ∈ Σ ∪ Σ−1 .)
If the group A = Aut (Fr ) has Kazhdan property (T ), then an argument similar
to Proposition 1.11 would give that Ωr (G) are expanders. The random walk on
them converges then very fast to the uniform distribution. This would give a
conceptual explanation for the great performances of the algorithm.
Unfortunately, it is still a (quite well-known) open problem whether Aut (Fr )
has (T ) (it does not for r = 2, 3; see [GL]). Still the approach presented here was
suﬃcient to get some unconditional results for various classes of ﬁnite groups, for
example, for abelian groups, or more generally, nilpotent groups of bounded class.
It is shown in [LP] that the subgroup of Aut(Fr (c)), the automorphism group of the
free nilpotent group on r generators and class c, generated by the “Nielsen moves”
(as above) has (T ) if r ≥ 3. One can therefore deduce a linear mixing time for the
random walk on Ωr (G) for G nilpotent (to be compared with the subexponential
bound obtained in [DSC] without the use of expanders). This explains, at least for
these groups, the outstanding performances of the product replacement algorithm.
See [LP] for the details and a more general conjecture.
4. Expanders in number theory
As was mentioned (though brieﬂy—for a more comprehensive treatment see [L1]
and [S1]), the theory of expanders has been related to number theory in several

136

ALEXANDER LUBOTZKY

ways. But, traditionally, the direction was from number theory to graph theory:
various deep results in number theory and the theory of automorphic forms have
been used to give explicit constructions of expanders and of Ramanujan graphs.
We now start to see applications in the opposite direction: from expander graphs
to number theory. The most notable one is the development of the aﬃne sieve
method. This section will be devoted to its description and applications. For other
applications, see [Ko1], [EHK] and [EMV].
4.1. Primes on orbits. Many results and problems in number theory are about
the existence of primes. There are inﬁnitely many primes in Z, but Dirichlet’s
classical result says more:
Theorem 4.1. If b, q ∈ Z with (b, q) = 1, then there are inﬁnitely many primes on
the arithmetic progression b + qZ.
If one wants to avoid the “local assumption” (b, q) = 1, the result can be restated
as, for every b and q = 0 in Z, the arithmetic sequence b + qZ has inﬁnitely many
numbers x with ν(x) ≤ 1 + ν((b, q)). Here for x ∈ Z, we write ν(x) for the number
of prime factors of x.
Another well-known problem about primes is:
Conjecture 4.2 (Twin Prime Conjecture). There are inﬁnitely many primes p,
for which p + 2 is also a prime.
Another way to state the conjecture is there are inﬁnitely many x ∈ Z with
ν(x(x + 2)) ≤ 2.
One also expects that the Twin Prime Conjecture is true along arithmetic progressions satisfying the “local condition” above.
A far-reaching generalization is the next conjecture of Schinzel and Sierpi´
nski
[SS], which needs some notation. Let Λ be an inﬁnite subgroup of Z, i.e., Λ = qZ
for some q = 0, and b ∈ Z. Let O be the orbit of b under the action of Λ on Z,
i.e., O = b + qZ. Let f (x) ∈ Q[x] be a polynomial which is integral on O. We say
that the pair (O, f ) is primitive if for every 2 ≤ k ∈ Z there exists x ∈ O such that
(f (x), k) = 1.
Conjecture 4.3 (Schinzel and Sierpi´
nski). If f (x) ∈ Q[x] is a product of t irreducible factors in Q[x], O = b + qZ as above, f is integral on O, and (O, f ) is
primitive, then there are inﬁnitely many x ∈ O with ν(f (x)) ≤ t.
Taking f (x) = x, one gets Dirichlet’s Theorem and, for f (x) = x(x + 2), the
Twin Prime Conjecture in its generalized form (also along arithmetic progressions).
There are various high-dimensional conjectures generalizing Dirichlet’s Theorem.
Let us set some more notation:
Let Λ be a non-trivial subgroup of Zn , b ∈ Zn and f (x1 , . . . , xn ) ∈ Q[x1 , . . . , xn ]
which is integral on O = b + Λ. For r ∈ N, we denote by O(f, r) the set of x ∈ O
for which ν(f (x)) ≤ r. We say that (O, f ) saturates if for some r < ∞, O(f, r) is
Zariski dense in (the Zariski closure of) O. The smallest such r, if it exists at all,
will be denoted by r0 (O, f ).
Conjecture 4.4 (Hardy and Littlewood [HL]). Let Λ be a subgroup of Zn . Assume
that for each j, the jth coordinate function xj is non-constant when restricted to
Λ. Let b ∈ Zn , O = b + Λ, and f (x) = x1 · x2 · . . . · xn , and assume (O, f ) is
primitive. Then r0 (O, f ) = n; i.e., the set of x ∈ O all of whose coordinates are
simultaneously primes, is Zariski dense in b + CΛ and in particular, it is inﬁnite.

A recent breakthrough of Green, Tao, and Ziegler ([GTZ], [GT2]) has proved
this conjecture for the case when rank(Λ) ≥ 2. The most diﬃcult case is when
rank(Λ) = 1. For example, by looking at b = (1, 3) ∈ Z2 and Λ = Z(1, 1), we see
that the Twin Prime Conjecture is a special case.
Another special case is the following famous result proved not long ago by Green
and Tao [GT1]:
Theorem 4.5 (Arithmetic progressions of primes). For every 3 ≤ k ∈ N, the set
of primes contains an arithmetic progression of length k.
To see that Theorem 4.5 is a special case of Conjecture 4.4, look at Zk and let Λ be
the 2-dimensional subgroup Λ = Z(1, 1, 1, . . . , 1) + Z(0, 1, 2, 3, . . . , k − 1). Then the
orbit of (1, 1, . . . , 1) is Λ, which is the set {(m, m+n, m+2n, . . . , m+(k−1)n|m, n ∈
Z}. Conjecture 4.4 implies that there are inﬁnitely many vectors of this kind whose
entries are all primes.
The formulation of the Hardy-Littlewood Conjecture 4.4 naturally suggests
studying the existence of prime vectors (i.e., vectors whose all coordinates are
primes) in the orbit Λ.b when this time Λ is a subgroup of GLn (Z). Somewhat
surprisingly this has not been studied until recent years. It seems that counterexamples of the following kind led us to think that no real theory could be developed:
Example 4.6. Let Λ be the cyclic subgroup of SL2 (Z) generated by ( 78 67 ) and
b = (1, 1)t . The orbit Λ.b is contained in {(x, y) ∈ Z2 |4x2 − 3y 2 = 1}, from which
one easily sees that no such y is a prime, in spite of the fact that for this problem
there are no “local obstructions”.
Another example of a similar ﬂavor is:
≤ SL2 (Z), b = (2, 1)t , and let O
Example 4.7 ([S7], [BGS2]). Let Λ = 31 −1
0
be the orbit Λ.b. The orbit lies on the hyperbola {(x, y) ∈ Z2 |x2 − 3xy + y 2 = 1} and
for n ∈ N we get the pairs (f2n−2 , f2n ), where fn is the nth Fibonacci number (one
can deﬁne them for n < 0 as well). While it is conjectured that inﬁnitely many of
the fn ’s are primes, the f2n are not. In fact, f2n = fn ln when ln is the nth Lucas
number. Moreover, it is even expected that f2n has an unbounded number of prime
factors, when n → ∞. (See [BLMS].)
The exciting fact, which came out only in recent years, is that these examples
are exceptional, not typical. The Zariski closure in these cases is a torus. We will
see below how conjectures and results (!) such as the Hardy-Littlewood Conjecture
have non-abelian analogues when a torus is not involved. The key new ingredients
for all this are the expanders combined with the classical combinatorial sieve of
Brun. This will be our topic in the next section.
4.2. Brun sieve and expanders. For 0 < x ∈ R, denote by P(x) the set of primes
smaller than or equal to x, π(x) = |P(x)| and P (x) = p∈P(x) p. Evaluating π(x)
is one of the most important problems in mathematics, if not the most important.
Well, the prime number theorem says that π(x) ∼ logx x and the Riemann hypothesis
gives a sharp bound for the error term in this asymptotic result. In fact, one has
an exact formula for π(x), which was given by Legendre at the end of the 18th
century.

By current standards the proof
√ is a simple application of the inclusion-exclusion
formula: the primes between x√and x are those integers n = 1 which are not
divisible by any prime less than x. √
So we count them by taking x, subtracting
those divisible by one prime less than x, adding the number of those divisible by
two primes, etc. Basically, we are applying the classical Eratosthenes’ sieve method.
While Proposition 4.8 gives an exact formula, it is not very useful. The error

p and its integral part is “small”, bounded by

1. But there are so many summands (approximately 4 x/logx ), which makes the
formula quite useless.
Various “sieve methods” have been developed for problems like that—the reader
is referred to [FI] and [IK], for example. Let us say a few words about the combinatorial sieve developed by Brun. His main motivation was to handle the Twin
Prime Conjecture 4.2. In a diﬀerent language it says that if f (x) = x(x + 2), then
for inﬁnitely many n’s in N, f (n) is a product of only two primes, i.e., ν(f (n)) ≤ 2.
Let f (x) be any integral polynomial f (x) ∈ Z[x], e.g., f (x) = x(x + 2). Let x be a
large real number, and z < x. Denote:
1,

S(f, z) :=
n≤x
(f (n),P (z))=1

so S(f, z) counts those n less than x such that f (n) is not divisible by any prime
less than z. Of course, we want z to be as large as possible.
Recall the M¨obius function
⎧
1 if n = 1,
⎨
(−1)r if n = p1 · . . . · pr with distinct primes,
μ(n) =
⎩
0 otherwise.
The following is well known and easy to prove:
μ(d) =
d|n

1 n = 1,
0 n > 1.

One can therefore now write:
S(f, z) :=

1=
n≤x
(f (n),P (z))=1

=

μ(d)
d|P (z)

μ(d)
n≤x d|(f (n),P (z))

1 .
n≤x
f (n)≡0(d)

We now denote:
β(d) = |{m mod d|f (m) ≡ 0(d)}|,
i.e., the number of solutions of f mod d. Running over all n’s up to x, one then runs
approximately xd times on all the residues mod d; approximately xd β(d) of them will

EXPANDER GRAPHS IN PURE AND APPLIED MATHEMATICS

give zeros for f mod d. So, continuing the evaluation of S(f, z) we have
S(f, z) =

μ(d)(
d|P (z)

β(d)
x + r(d)),
d

where r(d) is an error term. Note that β(d)
d is a multiplicative function of d.
Brun developed a method to analyze such a sum with particular interest in
the case f (x) = x(x + 2). He deduced that for δ small enough, if z = xδ , then
x
S(f, z) ≥ c log(x)
2 , which means that there are inﬁnitely many n’s with no prime
divisor for f (n) less than nδ . For such n’s, ν(f (n)) ≤ degδ f . So, while he fell short
of proving the Twin Prime Conjecture, he was able to show that there are inﬁnitely
many n’s with ν(f (n)) ≤ 18. His method has been reﬁned; the current record is
due to Chen [Ch] who replaced 18 by 3. Namely, there are inﬁnitely many pairs
(n, n + 2) such that one of them is a prime and the other is a product of at most
two primes.
These “combinatorial sieve methods” have also been applied to the higher dimensional cases described in §4.1. For example, one gets a partial result toward the
Hardy-Littlewood Conjecture: in the notation of Conjecture 4.4, one can prove that
there exists r ∈ N such that r0 (O, f ) ≤ r. In particular, the orbit b + Λ contains
inﬁnitely many vectors, all of whose entries are products of a bounded number of
primes. Moreover, it has even been proved that this r depends only on n and not
on b or Λ (assuming, of course, no local obstructions, i.e., (O, f ) is primitive).
All this is a quite deep (and quite technical) theory. The relevance for our
story came from the insight of Sarnak who noticed that the machinery of the Brun
sieve can be carried out also for a general non-commutative subgroup Λ ≤ GLn (Z)
acting of Zn , provided Λ has property (τ ) w.r.t. congruence subgroups. The orbit
in this case of b ∈ Zn is Λ.b = {γ.b|γ ∈ Γ}, and one can start the same kind of
computation we illustrated above for the Twin Prime problem. This time, instead
of summing over all n ≤ x, one sums over the ball of radius at most k, with
respect to a ﬁxed set of generators Σ of Λ. The crucial point is that these balls
B(k) = {γ ∈ Λ| lengthΣ (γ) ≤ k} when acting on b ∈ Zn and reduced mod d, i.e.,
the set B(k).b(mod d), distribute almost uniformly over the vectors Γ.b(mod d), as
a subset of (Z/dZ)n . This is exactly what the expander property gives us (compare
with Proposition 1.6).
At ﬁrst sight this connection with expanders may look counterintuitive: we want
to extend sieve methods from abelian cases, such as the Hardy-Littlewood Conjecture, to a non-abelian setting. The abelian case never gives rise to expanders (see
[LW]). Why should this be the needed property in the non-abelian case? The point
is that in the abelian setting the number of integer points in arithmetic progressions
which are contained in a large interval can be estimated quite accurately in the obvious way. But in the non-abelian setting, it is not clear what is the distribution
of the points in a ball when taken mod d. Note also that such groups usually have
exponential growth, and so when we move from ball B(k) to B(k + 1) the boundary
is as large as the original ball. The expanding property enables one to overcome this
diﬃculty. In fact, one does not need that Λ < GLn (Z) has (τ ) with respect to all
congruence subgroups; it suﬃces to know it with regard to congruence subgroups
mod d when d is square-free.
All this machinery was put to work in the paper of Bourgain, Gamburd, and
Sarnak ([BGS1], [BGS2]). At the time when the paper was written property (τ )

140

ALEXANDER LUBOTZKY

was known for such Λ’s only when the Zariski closure of Γ was SL2 (due to Helfgott
[H1], Bourgain and Gamburd [BG1] and the extension to all square-free numbers
in [BGS2]). But they also proved some conditional results, assuming an aﬃrmative
answer to some generalized form of the 1-2-3 problem (see §2.5 and §2.6). That
work gave a push to eﬀorts in this direction by a good number of authors ([BG3],
[BG4], [BGS3], [BV], [B2], [BG2], [H2], [GH], [V], [BGT2], [PS2], [S7], [SGV]) as
described in §2.6. The most general result for the “aﬃne-sieve method” as it is now
called, is given in a forthcoming paper of Salehi Golseﬁdy and Sarnak [SGS]:
Theorem 4.9. Let Λ ≤ GLn (Z) be a ﬁnitely generated subgroup with Zariski
closure G. Assume the reductive part of G0 (the connected component of G) is
semisimple. Let b ∈ Zn , O = Γ.b and f ∈ Q[x1 , . . . , xn ], which is integral and not
constant on O. Then (O, f ) saturates; namely, there exists r ∈ N such that the set
of vectors in O for which f (x) is a product of at most r primes is Zariski dense in
O.
This theorem also covers cases when G is unipotent (and so various classical results) as well as completely new cases when G is semisimple. The method is called
“aﬃne sieve” as it also covers “aﬃne transformations” of Zn and not only linear.
The aﬃne case can be easily reduced to a linear case of higher dimensions. Some
of the classical problems (e.g., the Hardy-Littlewood Conjecture) are naturally expressed as aﬃne problems rather than linear.
The case which is not covered by the last general theorem is of a torus (or when
one has a central torus in G). Some of the diﬃcult problems in number theory can
be presented in this language; e.g., the Mersenne Conjecture—there are inﬁnitely
many primes p with 2p − 1 also a prime, is such a problem (see [BGS2, §2.1]). But
the set of primes is “too thin” to sieve over it. So the new method shed no new
light on this conjecture. It is not even known if there are inﬁnitely many almost
primes of the form 2n − 1.
Still there are few concrete problems where the new method gives some fascinating results. Some of them will be described in the next section.
4.3. Some applications to classical problems. Theorem 4.9 above gives some
results which are completely out of reach by other methods; e.g., if Λ ≤ GLn (Z) is
a group as in the theorem, then the group itself contained inﬁnitely many matrices
which are almost primes, i.e., all their entries are products of a bounded number of
primes. An example satisfying this is any non-virtually cyclic subgroup of SL2 (Z).
But, here Theorem 4.9 answers questions which have not been asked before.
Let us now present (following [BGS2], [S5], [S8]) two applications to classical
number-theoretic problems:
Pythagorian triangles. Look at right angle triangles with integral edges x1 , x2 ,
and x3 such that x23 = x21 + x22 and assume that g.c.d.(x1 , x2 , x3 ) = 1. It is well
known that in this case there exist m, n ∈ Z, one odd, one even, and (m, n) = 1
s.t. x1 = m2 − n2 , x2 = 2mn and x3 = m2 + n2 . It follows that x1 is divisible by
3 and x2 is divisible by 4. So the area of the triangle A = x12x2 is divisible by 6.
All the Pythagorian triples (x1 , x2 , x3 ) as above are obtained as the orbit O of the
triples (3, 4, 5) acted upon by OF (Z) when F is the quadratic form x21 + x22 − x23
and Λ = OF (Z) is the group of 3 × 3 integral matrices preserving this form. The
group Λ satisﬁes the conditions of Theorem 4.9, and f = x12x2 is integral on O (and

EXPANDER GRAPHS IN PURE AND APPLIED MATHEMATICS

141

even divisible by 6). We deduce that there are inﬁnitely many triples whose areas
are almost primes.
Now what is r0 (O, f )—i.e., what is the minimal r for which the set of triples
with ν(area) ≤ r is Zariski dense? This is a more delicate question. Some elementary arguments show that it is at least 6 and some recent work of Green and Tao
[GT2] implies that it is indeed 6. (See [BGS2] and the references therein for more
information.)
Integral Apollonian Packing. A classical theorem of Apollonius asserts that
given three mutually tangent circles C1 , C2 , and C3 , there are exactly two circles C4
and C4 tangent to all three. Descartes’ Theorem says that the curvatures of these
circles (i.e., the reciprocals of the radii) a1 , a2 , a3 , a4 satisfy F (a1 , a2 , a3 , a4 ) = 0
where
(1)

F (a1 , a2 , a3 , a4 ) = 2(a21 + a22 + a23 + a24 ) − (a1 + a2 + a3 + a4 )2

(a negative solution corresponds to a situation when one circle touches the others
from the outside). An easy calculation using (1) shows that given C1 , C2 , C3 with
curvatures a1 , a2 , a3 , respectively, there are two solutions C4 and C4 with curvatures
a4 and a4 satisfying
a4 = 2a1 + 2a2 + 2a3 − a4 .

(2)

It also shows that starting with an integral vector (a1 , a2 , a3 , a4 ), the other quadruple (a1 , a2 , a3 , a4 ) is also integral. This can be carried out with any subtriple of
C1 , C2 , C3 , C4 . We deduce the following: let
S1 =

−1

and let Λ be the subgroup generated by these four reﬂections. Then starting with
any integral quadruple b = (a1 , a2 , a3 , a4 ) of integral curvatures of mutually touching circles, all elements in the orbit Λ.b represent such quadruples. Moreover if
γ = Si γ in Λ, then the corresponding quadruple share a common triple. See
Figure 1 for the starting stages of the orbit (18, 23, 27, 146).
The subgroup Λ of GL4 (Z) preserves the quadratic form F of equation (1). It
therefore lies within a conjugate of SO(3, 1) and, in fact, it is Zariski dense there.
One can therefore deduce from Theorem 4.9 various number-theoretic results on
the orbit Λ.b.
But many more questions come up naturally. Are there inﬁnitely many primes
in the set of curvatures of the circles in the orbit? How many? One wishes to
have a “prime number theorem” estimating the density of prime curvatures within
the orbit of the ball of radius N in Λ (w.r.t. {Si }4i=1 ). Are there inﬁnitely many
twin primes? That is, are there inﬁnitely many kissing pairs of circles with prime
curvatures?
A rich theory has started to emerge in recent years (cf. [GLMWY], [S5], [S8],
[KO1], [Fu], [BK], [BF], [FS], [KO2], and the references therein). This is a fascinating crossroad of number theory, geometry, group theory, dynamics, ergodic theory,
and expanders!

5. Applications to group theory
In the previous sections the connections between expander graphs and group
theory have been illustrated over and over again. Many (in some sense “most”)
of the examples we gave for expander graphs were Cayley graphs of groups and
being expanders says something quite deep on their group structure and/or their
representation theory.
In this section we will describe several results about groups whose formulations
do not mention expanders but expanders come out substantially in the proofs,
sometimes in a somewhat surprising way. We will start with describing a new sieve
method for ﬁnitely generated groups and indicate several applications to linear
groups and to the mapping class groups. This is a new direction, and it can be
expected that this sieve method will have further use in group theory.
We will also bring some applications to combinatorial group theory, a direction
whose signiﬁcance will be fully appreciated in the next section when we discuss
geometric applications.
5.1. Measuring subsets of ﬁnitely generated groups. Let G = GLn (C) be
the group of n × n invertible complex matrices. A standard claim on G is, for
generic g ∈ G, the centralizer CG (g) of g in G is abelian. What do we mean by this
statement? What is meant by “generic”? Well, one can work in the Baire category
setting, in the measure-theoretic language, or in the Zariski topology. Whatever
setting we choose, the statement says that outside of a “meager” subset of G, the
property of abelian centralizer is satisﬁed. The proof is easy: For almost every
g ∈ G the eigenvalues of g are all distinct (since the set of zeros of the discriminant
is “meager”). Thus, with a suitable basis of Cn , g is diagonal with n diﬀerent
eigenvalues, and the centralizer of such a g is just the diagonal matrices and hence
abelian.
Let us now look at the ﬁnitely generated group Γ = SLn (Z). Say we want to
claim a similar statement about Γ: “For generic g ∈ Γ the centralizer CΓ (g) is
abelian”. What does this mean? Is there a natural way to “measure” subsets of Γ
to be “small” or “large”? On a countable set such as Γ one cannot take a “uniform
distribution”. This is a problem not only in group theory. The reader is referred to
an interesting lecture by Barry Mazur [Maz] which illustrates, via various questions

EXPANDER GRAPHS IN PURE AND APPLIED MATHEMATICS

143

in number theory, that one may have quite diﬀerent answers to similar problems
depending on the probabilistic model.
These types of questions have recently received attention also from another point
of view. Complexity theory, i.e., the theory of algorithms, usually deals with “worstcase scenario”, i.e., a problem is considered “diﬃcult” if it is diﬃcult for some inputs. But, in real life quite often we really care whether it is easy or diﬃcult for
“most” cases, for the “generic” inputs. These two diﬀerent approaches to complexity theory can be very diﬀerent. There are even “undecidable” problems which can
be solved in polynomial time for “most” inputs. In recent years there have been a
number of papers studying this direction in combinatorial group theory. Some of it
was motivated by the proposal of various cryptosystems based on the braid groups.
This led to various approaches to the notion of “generic” elements in a ﬁnitely
generated group (cf. [KMSS1], [KMSS2], [KS1], and [MR]). Let us call the reader’s
attention to [BMNVW], where it is shown that the answer to a problem can be
very diﬀerent in two diﬀerent models of randomness, even if both are “natural”.
Anyway, here is the model we will work with: Let Γ be a group generated by a
ﬁnite symmetric set Σ. We will assume that Σ satisﬁes some relation of odd length.
(This is a non-essential condition that simpliﬁes the notation, avoiding bipartite
graphs in what follows. It happens automatically if e—the identity element of Γ—
is in Σ.) A walk w on Γ w.r.t. Σ is a function w : N+ → Σ. The kth step of w
is wk := w (1) · . . . · w (k) (where w0 = e). The uniform measure μ on Σ induces
+
a product measure μ on the set of Σ-walks WΣ := ΣN . For a subset Z of Γ we
denote the probability that the kth step of a walk belongs to Z by prob (wk ∈ Z).
We say that Z is exponentially small w.r.t. Σ if there are constants c, α > 0 s.t.
prob (wk ∈ Z) ≤ ce−αk for every k ∈ N. If this happens w.r.t. every such Σ
(where c and α may depend on Σ), Z is exponentially small. We will say that Z is
exponentially generic if its complement in Γ is exponentially small.
Now, once there is a meaning to being “small” and “large”, we can see that the
set of g’s in Γ = SLn (Z) for which CΓ (g) is not abelian is exponentially small.
Indeed, ﬁx a set Σ of generators for Γ and let k ∈ N and p be a prime of size
exponential in k. The set Zp of matrices in SLn (Fp ) with multiple eigenvalues
|Zp |
(i.e., the discriminant equals zero) satisﬁes |SLn (F
∼ p1 . By Proposition 1.12 and
p )|
Theorem 2.3, Y = Cay (SLn (Fp ) ; Σ) are ε-expanders for some ε depending on Σ
but not on p. Thus by Proposition 1.6, the random walk on Y falls into Zp at time
k with probability approximately p1 , which is exponentially small in k.
The above argument illustrates how expanders play an important role in measuring subsets of Γ. Similar ideas can lead to results which at ﬁrst sight look very
diﬀerent:
Theorem 5.1 ([BCLM]). Let Γ be a linear group generated by a ﬁnite set Σ. If Γ
is not virtually nilpotent, then Γ has exponential conjugacy growth; i.e., there exists
a constant C > 1 such that for every k
0, the ball of radius k around the identity
in Cay (Γ; Σ) intersects non-trivially at least C k diﬀerent conjugacy classes.
Here the point of the proof is that in congruence quotients, each conjugacy class
is “small”. In the last result, and in the stronger forms of it in [BCLM], one does
not really need the full power of expanders, and results such as Theorem 2.22 above
suﬃce. That is why it also holds in positive characteristic. This is not the case for
the more powerful method we will apply in the next section, which needs Theorem

144

ALEXANDER LUBOTZKY

2.24. At this point, this last result is known only in characteristic zero. It will be
very useful to prove an analogous result for positive characteristic.
5.2. Sieve method in group theory. The results mentioned in the previous section “measure” a subset Z of Γ = SLn (Z) (or more general linear groups) by
projecting it to SLn (Fp ) for one prime p, at a time, showing that the projection
Zp is “small” and, since SLn (Fp ) is an expander, the random walk meets Zp with
exponentially small probability. This method works for sets Z for which the projections Zp are small, e.g., when Z is an intersection of an algebraic variety V with
Γ. In this case, indeed, the projection Zp is “small” by the famous Lang–Weil
Theorem. But for various natural problems, the projection Zp of Z mod p is large
(say, proportional to the size of SLn (Fp )). For dealing with such problems, one
needs the group sieve method, which is a group theoretical analogue of the “large
sieve” in analytic number theory.
We can now formulate the general “group sieve method”:
Theorem 5.2. Let Γ be a ﬁnitely generated group. Let (Ni )i∈I be a series of ﬁnite
index normal subgroups of Γ, where I ⊆ N. Assume that there are constants γ > 0
and d ∈ N+ such that:
1. |{i ∈ I | i ≤ ek }| ≥ eγk for every large enough k ∈ N.
2. Γ has property (τ ) w.r.t. the family of normal subgroups (Ni ∩ Nj )i,j∈I .
3. |Γi | ≤ id for every i ∈ I, where Γi := Γ/Ni .
4. The natural map Γi,j → Γi ×Γj is an isomorphism for every distinct i, j ∈ I
where Γi,j := Γ/Ni ∩ Nj .
Then a subset Z ⊆ Γ is exponentially small if there is c > 0 such that:
5.

|Zi |
|Γi |

≤ 1 − c for every i ∈ I, where Zi := ZNi /Ni .

The above formulation is taken from [LM1]. This is a generalization (and simpliﬁcation) of a method used by Rivin [Ri1], and by Kowalski [Ko1]. It has been
greatly inﬂuenced by the “aﬃne sieve” of Section 4.
The last theorem gives a very general result, but applying it for particular cases
still requires a substantial amount of work. The more diﬃcult part is establishing
properties 2 and 5 in the theorem above. Property 2 is true for a large class of
groups by Theorem 2.24. (This theorem is formulated for subgroups of GLn (Q)
but usually one can reduce questions about general ﬁnitely generated linear groups,
over ﬁelds of characteristic zero, to this case by the method of specialization; cf.
[LM1].) As mentioned in §5.1, it will be useful to have an analogue of Theorem
2.24 for ﬁelds of positive characteristic. Once this is done, the group sieve method
should give various applications for these cases also.
Property 5 of Theorem 5.2 depends very much on each speciﬁc problem. Let us
describe here the case where Z ⊆ Γ is the subset of all proper powers in Γ, i.e.,
Z = m≥2 Z (m), where for 2 ≤ m ∈ N, we denote Z (m) = {γ m | γ ∈ Γ} the set of
m-powers. The main result of [LM1] is the following:
Theorem 5.3. Let Γ be a ﬁnitely generated linear group over a characteristic zero
ﬁeld. Assume Γ is not virtually solvable. Then
Z=

{γ m | γ ∈ Γ}

Z (m) =
2≤m∈N

is an exponentially small subset of Γ.

2≤m∈N

EXPANDER GRAPHS IN PURE AND APPLIED MATHEMATICS

145

This theorem is a far-reaching straightening of the main result of [HKLS]. Not
only does it give a quantitative result on Z, but it also deals with the union of all
the Z (m)’s together. In [HKLS] only ﬁnitely many m’s could be considered at a
time. This is the power of the sieve which enables such a stronger result.
The proof of property 5 of Theorem 5.2 for this case also needs some careful
treatment: the projection of Z is onto for every ﬁnite quotient. (This means that
Z is dense in the proﬁnite topology of Γ and still exponentially small!) Thus one
has to treat each Z (m) separately, getting quantitative results and then summing
them together (see [LM1] for details).
5.3. The mapping class group. In this section we will apply the group sieve
method to A = Aut (Fn ), the automorphism group of the free group on n generators and to M = MCG (g), the mapping class group of a closed surface Sg of genus
g. The group M is isomorphic to Out
g = Aut
g /Inn
g , the group of
outer automorphisms of g = π1 (Sg ), the fundamental group of Sg . The group g
has a presentation with 2g generators a1 , . . . , ag , b1 , . . . , bg subject to one relation
g
−1 −1
b ab. The mapping class group is of great impori=1 [ai , bi ], where [a, b] = a
tance in topology and geometry and we will come back to these aspects in Section
6, where we will treat geometric applications of expanders. Here we mainly treat
it from its algebraic description, though the major question comes from topology.
Thurston classiﬁed the elements of M into three kinds: (i) pseudo-Anosov, (ii)
reducible, and (iii) elliptic. This is somewhat similar in spirit to the classiﬁcation
of elements of MCG (1) = SL2 (Z) into hyperbolic, parabolic, and elliptic. We will
not give the exact deﬁnitions, sending the reader to [Ri1], [Ko1], and the references
therein for details. Thurston conjectured that “generic” elements of M are pseudoAnosov. In one form (which is weaker and stronger than the following theorem)
this was proved by Maher ([Ma1], [Ma2]). Rivin [Ri1] (see also Kowalski [Ko1])
proved, by using the sieve method:
Theorem 5.4. The set of pseudo-Anosov elements of M = MCG (g) is exponentially generic.
The proof uses the fact that M = MCG (g) is mapped onto the arithmetic
group Γ = Sp (2g, Z). Now, a criterion due to Casson and Bleiler gives a suﬃcient
condition for an element γ of M to be pseudo-Anosov in terms of some conditions on
its image γ ∈ Γ. Rivin showed that the set of those γ ∈ Γ which do not satisfy this
condition is exponentially small and deduced that the non-pseudo-Anosov elements
of M form an exponentially small set.
The proof sketched above gives no information on the subgroup
T = ker (MCG (g) → Sp (2g, Z)) ,
the Torelli subgroup of the mapping class group. It was asked by Kowalski [Ko1]
whether a similar result to Theorem 5.4 holds also for T . In [LM2] and in [MS],
independently, it was shown to be the case by using various representations of T
onto Sp (2 (g − 1) , Z) obtained by considering the action of T on the homology
of the two-sheeted covers of the surface Sg (or equivalently on the commutator
quotients of the index 2 subgroups of g ) in the spirit of [Lo] and [GL].
The above-mentioned results have analogous results, proved also in [Ri1], [Ri2],
[Ko1] and [LM3], for Aut (Fn ) replacing MCG (g).The role of pseudo-Anosov is
played by either the “fully irreducible” automorphisms (also called irreducible with

146

ALEXANDER LUBOTZKY

irreducible powers, or iwip, for short) or by the “hyperbolic” automorphisms. The
ﬁrst are the automorphisms α ∈ Aut (Fn ) such that no positive power of α sends a
free factor H of Fn to a conjugate. The second are the automorphisms α such that
for every m ≥ 1, no conjugacy class of Fn is preserved by αm . There are iwip automorphisms which are not hyperbolic and hyperbolic automorphisms which are not
iwip. The conclusion is that the automorphisms which are iwip and hyperbolic are
exponentially generic in Aut (Fn ) as well as in IA (n) = ker (Aut (Fn ) → GLn (Z))
when n ≥ 3.
5.4. The generic Galois group of linear groups. The method of proof of the
results in the previous section showed (when establishing the criterion of Casson
and Bleiler mentioned there) something stronger which is of independent interest:
for an exponentially generic matrix A ∈ SLn (Z), the Galois group over Q of the
splitting ﬁeld of the characteristic polynomial of A is isomorphic to Sym (n), the
full symmetric group on n letters. Similarly, for generic elements in Sp (2g, Z), the
Galois group of the splitting polynomial is isomorphic to the Weyl group of the
algebraic group Sp (2g). A common generalization was proved by Jouve, Kowalski
and Zywina [JKZ].
Theorem 5.5. Let k be a number ﬁeld, and let G be a connected semisimple group
deﬁned and split over k with a faithful representation ρ : G → GL (m) deﬁned
over k. Let Γ ⊆ G (k) be an arithmetic subgroup. Then for exponentially generic
elements A in Γ, the Galois group of the splitting ﬁeld over k of the characteristic
polynomial of A is isomorphic to the Weyl group W (G) of the algebraic group G.
Although this statement seems to be asymptotic, the method is eﬀective and
enables one, for example, to ﬁnd matrices whose characteristic polynomials have
W (E8 ) as their Galois groups over k.
The reader is referred to [JKZ] for a more general result when G does not split
and to [LR] for more general linear groups. (The results are somewhat diﬀerent!)
Those results use heavily the fact that congruence quotients are expanders. But
they also need an interesting use of the Chebotarev theorem which “provides”
elements in conjugacy classes of the “target” Galois group. These elements are
deﬁned only up to conjugacy. This leads to the following interesting notion:
Deﬁnition 5.6. A subset S of a ﬁnite group G is said to generate G invariably if
G = sg(s) s ∈ S for any choice of g (s) ∈ G (i.e., if every element of S is replaced
by some conjugate of it, we still get a set of generators).
This is an interesting group-theoretic invariant of importance for computational
group theory. For some basic properties of it, see [KLS] and the references therein.
It illustrates once again how results and methods from pure mathematics and computer science enrich each other back and forth.
5.5. Property (τ ) in combinatorial group theory. Let Γ be a discrete group.
It is called residually ﬁnite if the intersection of the ﬁnite index subgroups is trivial.
We say that Γ splits if Γ can be written as a free product with amalgamation A ∗ B
C

or as an HNN-construction A∗C1 =C2 in a non-trivial way, i.e., C A, B. It is well
known that Γ splits if and only if it acts on a simplicial tree without a (common)
ﬁxed point. Note that if Γ is ﬁnitely generated, then it is an HNN-construction

EXPANDER GRAPHS IN PURE AND APPLIED MATHEMATICS

147

if and only if Γ is mapped surjectively onto the inﬁnite cyclic group Z, and this
happens iﬀ the commutator subgroup [Γ, Γ] of Γ is of inﬁnite index.
For a ﬁnitely generated group Λ, we denote by d (Λ) the minimal number of
generators of Λ. The rank gradient of Γ, RG (Γ) is deﬁned as
RG (Γ) = inf

d (Λ) − 1 Λ ﬁnite index
[Γ : Λ] subgroup of Γ

.

The following result of Lackenby [La1] gives a surprising connection between (τ ),
splitting, and RG (Γ).
Theorem 5.7. Let Γ be a ﬁnitely presented residually ﬁnite group. Then Γ satisﬁes
(at least) one of the following three properties:
(a) Γ virtually splits (i.e., has a ﬁnite index subgroup Λ which splits).
(b) Γ has property (τ ).
(c) RG (Γ) = 0.
The method of proof is as follows: one assumes that Γ does not have (b) and
(c), i.e., the quotient graphs of Γ are not expanders, and RG (Γ) > 0, which means
that the number of generators of ﬁnite index subgroups grows linearly with the
index. These two pieces of information are used to deduce that a suitable ﬁnite
cover Y of a two-dimensional complex X with π1 (X) = Γ can be decomposed as
Y = Y1 ∪ Y2 in a non-trivial way that will enable us to apply the van Kampen
Theorem to deduce that π1 (Y ) splits; see [La1] for details.
As we will see in the next section, it is of great importance in the theory of
3-manifolds to be able to show that π1 (M ) of such a manifold M virtually splits.
So a result, such as Theorem 5.7 and various variants of it, is useful there as a tool
to get the desired conclusion.
Another application is that for every ﬁnitely presented amenable group Γ,
RG (Γ) = 0 since such a Γ does not have τ ([LW]) and cannot split since groups
which split contain non-abelian free groups (except for D∞ , the inﬁnite dihedral
group for which clearly RG = 0) while amenable groups cannot contain free groups.
This last corollary was extended to all ﬁnitely generated amenable groups in [AJN].
6. Expanders and geometry
In this section we describe several ways in which expanders have appeared, somewhat unexpectedly, in geometry. Most of these applications are for hyperbolic
manifolds. The background is given in §6.1. Then in §6.2 we will give the ﬁrst
application: a proof given in [L3] using expanders and property (τ ) of a conjecture
of Thurston and Waldhausen on positive virtual Betti numbers for arithmetic hyperbolic manifolds. Then in §6.3 we describe the attack of Lackenby on the “virtual
Haken conjecture” for hyperbolic 3-manifolds using expanders (or more precisely
the Lubotzky–Sarnak conjecture asserting that hyperbolic 3-manifolds hyperbolic
do not have (τ )). While, as of now, this attack has not led to a complete solution of
the virtual Haken conjecture, it has led to some partial results and opened exciting
new directions. In particular, it shows connections between the Heegaard genus of
3-manifolds and expanders. This will be elaborated upon further in §6.4. There we
will show another application of expanders to hyperbolic 3-manifolds. Moreover,
the notion of cost from dynamics will be related to 3-manifolds via expanders!

6.1. Hyperbolic manifolds. Let M be an oriented n-dimensional hyperbolic
manifold of ﬁnite volume. Such a manifold is obtained from the Lie group G =
SO(n, 1), the group of (n + 1) × (n + 1) real matrices preserving the quadratic form
2
, in the following way: Let K = SO(n) sitting as a maxiX12 + · · · + Xn2 − Xn+1
mal compact subgroup of G and Γ a torsion-free lattice (i.e., discrete subgroup of
ﬁnite covolume) in G. Then Hn = G/K is the n-dimensional hyperbolic space and
M = Γ \ G/K is a hyperbolic manifold of ﬁnite volume. All such manifolds are
obtained in that way. Many geometric questions on such an M can be translated to
group-theoretic questions about Γ, which is actually isomorphic to the fundamental
group of M as Hn is contractible.
One of these questions is the following conjecture usually attributed to Thurston
(though it probably goes back to Waldhausen):
Conjecture 6.1 (Thurston–Waldhausen conjecture). The manifold M has a ﬁnite
M with positive β1 (M0 ) := dim H1 (M0 , R), i.e., non-trivial hosheeted cover M0
mology group. Or, equivalently, in group-theoretic terms: every lattice Γ in SO(n, 1)
has a ﬁnite index subgroup Γ0 with |Γ0 /[Γ0 , Γ0 ]| = ∞.
The equivalence follows from two well-known facts: every lattice is ﬁnitely generated and has a torsion-free subgroup of ﬁnite index. The commutator quotient
Z, and this happens iﬀ the ﬁrst real
is inﬁnite iﬀ there is a surjective map Γ0
homology of Γ0 \ G/K is non-trivial.
Let us mention right at the start another conjecture, due to Serre [Se] (which is
now almost fully proved, see §6.2 below).
Conjecture 6.2 (Serre Conjecture). If Γ is an arithmetic lattice of G = SO(n, 1),
then Γ has a negative answer to the congruence subgroup property.
It is well known that the Thurston–Waldhausen conjecture implies Serre’s conjecture. This can be seen in one of the following ways:
ˆ is
(i) If Γ has the congruence subgroup property, then its proﬁnite completion Γ
the same as the congruence completion. The latter is a product of compact
p-adic analytic semisimple groups and as such, a ﬁnite index subgroup of
ˆ and Γ.
it should have ﬁnite abelianization. Thus the same applies to Γ
(ii) It is known that the congruence subgroup property for Γ implies superrigidity (cf. [Se]), but if Γ virtually maps onto Z, it does not have superrigidity.
An intermediate step between these two conjectures is:
Conjecture 6.3 (Lubotzky–Sarnak conjecture). If Γ is a lattice in SO(n, 1), then
Γ does not have property (τ ).
Now, Thurston–Waldhausen conjecture ⇒ Lubotzky–Sarnak conjecture ⇒ Serre
conjecture. Indeed, if a ﬁnite index subgroup of Γ is mapped onto Z, then it clearly
does not have (τ ) as Z does not have (τ ). Also, we mentioned in §2.5 that an
arithmetic lattice Γ always has (τ ) with respect to congruence subgroups. Thus, if
Γ does not have (τ ), it must also have non-congruence subgroups.
This last observation was the key point in [L3] to be described in §6.2. But before
going into these details, let us continue with another conjecture for the special case,
n = 3, which is the most interesting case:

EXPANDER GRAPHS IN PURE AND APPLIED MATHEMATICS

149

Conjecture 6.4 (Virtual Haken conjecture). A ﬁnite volume hyperbolic 3-manifold
M is virtually Haken, i.e., has a ﬁnite sheeted cover which is Haken (also known
as “suﬃciently large”).
Recall that Haken means that it contains an incompressible surface, i.e., a properly embedded orientable surface S (other than S 2 ) with π1 (S) injecting into π1 (M ).
It is known that M is Haken iﬀ π1 (M ) is either mapped onto Z or π1 (M ) is a free
product with amalgam in a non-trivial way, i.e., iﬀ π1 (M ) splits, in the terminology
of §5.5. From this it is clear that the Thurston–Waldhausen conjecture for n = 3
implies the virtual Haken conjecture.
6.2. Thurston–Waldhausen conjecture for hyperbolic arithmetic manifolds. The ﬁrst use of expanders in geometry came out in the proof of the following
result in [L3]:
Theorem 6.5. Conjecture 6.1 is true for arithmetic lattices in SO(n, 1) for n =
3, 7. Namely, every ﬁnite volume n-dimensional arithmetic hyperbolic manifold has
a ﬁnite sheeted cover with a positive ﬁrst Betti number if n = 3, 7.
The result also covers “most” of the arithmetic lattices in SO(3, 1) and SO(7, 1).
But these two cases are exceptional in having “more” arithmetic lattices than what
one ﬁnds in SO(n, 1) for other n’s. The reasons are that SO(3, 1) is locally isomorphic to SL2 (C) and as such it also has a complex structure, unlike all other n’s. On
the other hand, SO(7, 1) is a real form of SO(8). The later has Dynkin diagram of
type D4 and as such it also has a graph automorphism of order 3 (“the triality of
D4 ”) unlike the other Dn ’s which have only automorphisms of order 2. The theory of “Galois cohomology”, which enables one to classify the arithmetic lattices
in a given semisimple Lie group, shows that these anomalies give extra families of
arithmetic lattices in SO(3, 1) and SO(7, 1) which do not exist for other n’s. The
method of proof of Theorem 6.5 does not apply to these extra families.
The connection between Conjecture 6.1 and expanders (or more precisely property (τ )) is best explained via the following:
Lemma 6.6 (The Sandwich Lemma). Assume G1 ≤ G2 ≤ G3 are three noncompact simple Lie groups and for each i = 1, 2, 3, Γi is an arithmetic lattice in Gi
such that Γ1 ≤ Γ2 ≤ Γ3 , Γ2 = G2 ∩ Γ3 and Γ1 = G1 ∩ Γ3 (= G1 ∩ Γ2 ). Then the
following hold:
(i) If Γ1 has the Selberg property (i.e., property (τ ) w.r.t. congruence subgroups;
see Deﬁnition 2.14) and Γ3 does not have (τ ), then Γ2 has a negative answer
to the congruence subgroup problem (i.e., has non-congruence subgroups).
(ii) If Γ1 has the Selberg property and Γ3 has a congruence subgroup Λ with an
inﬁnite abelianization, then Γ2 also has such a congruence subgroup.
Part (i) of the lemma follows immediately from the Burger–Sarnak result (Theorem 2.17): indeed, the Selberg property of Γ1 “lifts up” to Γ2 . On the other hand,
Γ2 does not have (τ ), as otherwise Γ3 would have. Thus, Γ2 has (τ ) but does not
have Selberg. In other worlds, the quotients of Γ2 modulo congruence subgroups
give a family of expanders, while the family of all ﬁnite quotients does not. This
shows (in a very non-constructive way!) that there are non-congruence subgroups in
Γ2 ! The proof of (ii) needs to go deeper into the actual proof of the Burger–Sarnak
result (see [L3] and [BS]).

150

ALEXANDER LUBOTZKY

Anyway, the point is that when n = 3, 7, the arithmetic lattices in SO(n, 1)
SL2 (R) or
can be put to be Γ2 is such a sandwich: one takes G1 = SO(2, 1)
G1 = SO(3, 1)
SL2 (C) and one uses Jacquet–Langlands and Selberg results to
ensure the Selberg property. On the other hand, G3 = SU(n, 1) and one uses results
of Kazhdan, Shimura, and Borel and Wallach to ensure the needed properties of Γ3 ;
see [L3] and the references therein. These arguments show that if Γ is an arithmetic
lattice in SO(n, 1), n = 3, 7, it has a congruence subgroup which is mapped onto
Z. In particular, it does not satisfy (τ ) (so the Lubotzky and Sarnak Conjecture
6.3 is also valid) and does not have the congruence subgroup property (so Serre’s
conjecture 6.2 is also true for these cases).
All these three conjectures are still open for the lattices of SO(7, 1) coming from
the triality eﬀect of D4 . The story of n = 3 is more involved and more important.
This is our topic in the next section. We just mention in passing that the Thurston–
Waldhausen conjecture has been proved for the known non-arithmetic lattices in
SO(n, 1) for n ≥ 4 (see [L4]). It is still widely open for others (if they exist at
all . . . ).
6.3. Hyperbolic 3-manifolds. A few years ago, Marc Lackenby initiated a program to prove the virtual Haken conjecture for hyperbolic 3-manifolds (Conjecture
6.4 above). In his program, expanders (or property τ ) play a central role, as well
as the notion of Heegaard splitting. Let us recall the deﬁnition of the latter.
Let M be a connected, closed, orientable, and irreducible (i.e., any two-dimensional sphere in M bounds a three-dimensional ball) 3-manifold. We will be mainly
interested in hyperbolic 3-manifolds, i.e., the case when M = Γ\H3 , where Γ is a
cocompact torsion-free lattice in G = P SL2 (C).
A classical result asserts that every such M can be decomposed as a union of
two handle bodies M = H1 ∪ H2 glued along their (isomorphic) boundaries, i.e.,
H1 ∩ H2 = ∂H1 = ∂H2 . This decomposition (Heegaard splitting) is not unique.
The minimal number g of handles in H1 (or H2 —they are isomorphic) in such a
decomposition is called the Heegaard genus of M , denoted g(M ). Note that if H1
has g handles, its boundary is a closed surface of genus g and Euler characteristic
2 − 2g.
The following result of Lackenby [La3] shows a ﬁrst connection between the
Heegaard genus and the Cheeger constant h(M ) of M . See Deﬁnition 1.16 and
Theorem 1.20 for the deﬁnition of Cheeger constant of M and its connection with
expanders.
Theorem 6.7. Let M be a closed Riemannian 3-manifold with supremal sectional
curvature K < 0 (so K = −1 if M is hyperbolic). Then
h(M ) ≤

8π(g(M ) − 1)
.
|K|vol(M )

While this is a non-trivial result, the basic idea is simple: one proves that the
Heegaard splitting (which is a topological decomposition) can be carried out in such
a way that the two parts H1 and H2 have approximately equal volumes, half of the
volume of M . Now, the area of the boundary, which is a surface of genus g(M ), is
given by the Gauss-Bonnet formula as a linear function of g(M ) and the theorem
can be deduced.
Given a Heegaard splitting of M one can write a presentation of M with g
generators (say, pick a point on ∂H1 and take as generators the generators of

EXPANDER GRAPHS IN PURE AND APPLIED MATHEMATICS

151

π1 (H1 ), which is a free group on g generators) and g relations (obtained from nontrivial loops in H1 which become homotopically trivial once H2 is glued to H1 along
∂H2 ). In particular, one has:
Proposition 6.8. d(π1 (M )) ≤ g(M ); i.e., the number of generators of the fundamental group of M is bounded above by the Heegaard genus.
For general 3-manifolds this can be a strict inequality, but:
Conjecture 6.9 (Heegaard genus versus rank conjecture). If M is a compact
hyperbolic 3-manifold, then d(π1 (M )) = g(M ).
Now, if M0 is an r-sheeted cover of M , then the Heegaard splitting of M can
be lifted to M0 and one can deduce that g(M0 ) ≤ rg(M ). To “renormalize” this,
deﬁne:
Deﬁnition 6.10. Let Γ = π1 (M ), let L = {Ni } be a family of ﬁnite index subgroups of Γ, and let {Mi } be the corresponding ﬁnite sheeted covers. The inﬁmal
i )−2
.
Heegaard gradient χhL (M ) of M w.r.t. L is deﬁned as χhL (M ) = inf i 2g(M
[Γ:Ni ]
One uses 2g(Mi ) − 2, the negative of the Euler characteristic, rather than g(Mi ),
just for aesthetic reasons. The reader may note the connection with the rank
gradient deﬁned in §5.5, especially in light of Proposition 6.8.
There are many examples of M in which χhL (M ) = 0, where, say, L is a family
of (all) ﬁnite index subgroups of π1 (M ). This happens for example if M ﬁbres
over a circle (or virtually ﬁbres over a circle). There are many examples of such
hyperbolic 3-manifolds. In fact, a conjecture attributed to Thurston suggests that
every hyperbolic 3-manifold ﬁbres over a circle after passing to a suitable ﬁnite
sheeted cover. This is even stronger than Conjecture 6.1 above. In group-theoretic
terms it is equivalent to the assertion that Γ = π1 (M ) has a ﬁnite index subgroup
Z whose kernel Ker(π) is ﬁnitely generated.
Γ0 with an epimorphism π : Γ0
In this case Ker(π) must be a surface group of genus g and going along the cyclic
covers between Γ0 and Ker(π) we get inﬁnitely many covers with the same Heegaard
genus. Hence χhL (M ) = 0.
Lackenby conjectured that this is the only reason for the Heegaard gradient to
vanish, i.e.,
Conjecture 6.11 (Heegaard gradient conjecture). If M has a family of covers L
with χhL (M ) = 0, then M virtually ﬁbres over a circle.
He then proved:
Theorem 6.12. Let M be a closed, orientable 3-manifold, and let L = {Ni } be a
family ﬁnite index normal subgroups, with corresponding covers {Mi }. Assume:
a) χhL (M ) > 0;
b) Γ = π1 (M ) does not have property (τ ) w.r.t L.
Then M is virtually Haken.
This last result implies:
Corollary 6.13. The Lubotzky–Sarnak conjecture (Conjecture 6.3) and the Heegaard gradient conjecture (Conjecture 6.11) imply the virtual Haken conjecture
(Conjecture 6.4).

152

ALEXANDER LUBOTZKY

Indeed let M be a three-dimensional hyperbolic manifold, Γ = π1 (M ), and let
L be the family of all its ﬁnite index normal subgroups. By the Lubotzky–Sarnak
conjecture Γ does not have (τ ), so condition (b) of Theorem 6.12 is satisﬁed. If
χhL (M ) > 0, then M is virtually Haken by this theorem, while if χhL (M ) = 0,
then by the Heegaard gradient conjecture, M virtually ﬁbres over a circle and in
particular, is virtually Haken.
This puts property (τ ) and expanders at the heart of the theory of threedimensional manifolds. As of now, the full virtual Haken conjecture has not been
proven, but this approach, beside its intrinsic interest, led to some interesting unconditional results; cf. [La3], [La4], [LaLR1], [LaLR2].
6.4. Heegaard splitting, property (τ ), and cost. In the previous section we
saw the result of Lackenby, Theorem 6.7, which connects the Heegaard genus and
the Cheeger constant. The Cheeger constant is the geometric way to express expanders (see Theorem 1.20). These connections enabled Long, Lubotzky, and Reid
[LLR] to deduce the following geometric application of the theory of expanders.
Theorem 6.14. Let M be a closed hyperbolic 3-manifold. Then there exists a
sequence L = {Ni }i∈N of ﬁnite index normal subgroups of Γ = π1 (M ), with N1 ⊇
N1 ⊇ · · · and Ni = {e}, and χhL (M ) > 0. Namely, there is a constant c > 0 such
that for every i ∈ N, the Heegaard genus g(Mi ) ≥ c[Mi : M ], where Mi is the cover
of M corresponding to Ni of degree [Mi : M ] = [Γ : Ni ].
Remark 6.15. The formulation in [LLR] is slightly weaker than what is stated here.
At that time we used the theory of sum-product results in ﬁnite ﬁelds and its
applications to expanders in [BG1]. The more recent results (see Theorem 2.24
above) enable us to deduce the stronger version here.
It should be stressed that in many examples of M ’s as in Theorem 6.14, (and if
the Thurston Conjecture is correct, then in all such M ’s!), one can also ﬁnd a chain
of normal subgroups L in π1 (M ) with χhL (M ) = 0. This shows that the Heegaard
gradient does depend on the choice of chains of normal covers (even chains with
trivial intersections).
This brings us to another fascinating connection: the notion of cost.
Let Γ be a countable group acting ergodically on X, a standard Borel space,
by Borel automorphisms preserving a probability measure μ on X. Deﬁne the
equivalence relation E on X by xEy iﬀ x and y are on the same Γ-orbit. So E
is a subset of X × X, which can be thought of as deﬁning a graph on X. For an
arbitrary Borel subset S of X × X we denote degS (x) = |{y ∈ X|(x, y) ∈ S}| and
e(s) = x∈X degS (x)dμ (see [Gab2]).
We say that S spans E if E is the minimal equivalence relation on X which
contains S and deﬁne cost(E) = cost(Γ, X) as inf e(S) when S runs over all the
Borel subgraphs S spanning E.
One can easily see that if {γ1 , . . . , γd } generates Γ, then
d

{(x, γi x)}

S=
i=1 x∈X

spans E and so always cost(Γ, X) ≤ d(Γ), the number of generators of Γ.
This notion was introduced by Levitt [Le] and was used by Gaboriau [Gab1]
to distinguish between equivalence relations of diﬀerent group actions. Gaboriau
conjectured:

EXPANDER GRAPHS IN PURE AND APPLIED MATHEMATICS

153

Conjecture 6.16 (Fixed price conjecture). Given Γ, then cost(Γ, X) is the same
number for all ergodic, essentially free actions of Γ on a standard Borel space X.
(Essentially free means that the set of x ∈ X with non-trivial stabilizer in Γ is of
measure zero.)
Gaboriau proved this conjecture for various groups, but it is still widely open
for general Γ.
An interesting example in which the cost was computed explicitly is:
Theorem 6.17 (Ab´ert and Nikolov [AN]). Let Γ be a ﬁnitely generated group,
let L = {Ni }i∈N be a chain of ﬁnite index normal subgroups N1 ⊇ N2 ⊇ · · · with
¯
Γ/Ni , the proﬁnite completion of Γ w.r.t. L. The
I Ni = {e}, and let Γ = lim
←
¯
group Γ acts freely on Γ and
¯ = RGL (Γ) + 1,
cost(Γ, Γ)
where RGL (Γ) is the rank gradient of Γ (see §5.5) w.r.t. L, i.e., limi

d(Ni )−1
[Γ:Ni ] .

Now, if the ﬁxed price conjecture were true, it would follow that the rank gradient
of Γ does not depend on the chain L in the last theorem. On the other hand we saw
above that for Γ = π1 (M ), M a three-dimensional hyperbolic compact manifold,
the Heegaard genus gradient does depend on the choice of L. This enabled Ab´ert
and Nikolov to deduce:
Theorem 6.18. At least one of the two conjectures—the Heegaard genus versus
rank conjecture (Conjecture 6.9) and the ﬁxed price conjecture (Conjecture 6.16)—
is not true!
It is quite interesting how these two seemingly unrelated conjectures contradict
each other and for our story it is also interesting how this contradiction is via
property (τ ).
Of course, it might be that both conjectures are false! One may even speculate
that the ﬁxed price conjecture is false in general but it is true for hyperbolic groups,
just as it is true for free groups ([Gab1]). If this is the case, or even if it is true for
the much smaller class of fundamental groups of compact hyperbolic 3-manifolds,
then the Heegaard genus versus rank conjecture would be refuted.
Note added in proof. On June 30, 2011, Tao Li announced (see [Lit]) that there exists a compact hyperbolic 3-manifold M with d(π1 (M )) g(M ) and so Conjecture
6.9 is not true. Still if the ﬁxed cost conjecture is true, a stronger result would be

7. Miscellaneous
As mentioned in the introduction, expander graphs have a huge number of applications in computer science which we have not even begun to mention here. We
have focused on applications to pure mathematics. Even in this direction we were
not able to give a comprehensive survey. In this ﬁnal section we will just give a
list of topics that, for lack of time, space or the author’s expertise, have not found
their way into the main sections.
(I) The Baum–Connes conjecture. This is a famous deep conjecture. For
a user-friendly introduction, see [Va3]. Counterexamples to a generalized form of
it were given in [Gro1] and [HLS]. The original conjecture is still open, though it

154

ALEXANDER LUBOTZKY

was proved for many classes of groups. The counterexamples were given by random
groups constructed via expanders.
(II) Embedding metric spaces. There is great interest in embedding (ﬁnite)
metric spaces into Hilbert spaces in a way that the metric is more or less preserved.
In recent years this area has found many applications in computer science; see
[HLW, Chap. 13] and [Li]. Expander graphs play the role of graphs whose metric
is the farthest away from Euclidean.
(III) Dimension expanders. The notion of expander graphs has an analogue
in vector spaces. For a ﬁxed ﬁeld F and 0 < ε, we say that T1 , . . . , Tk ∈ EndF (F n ),
i.e., k linear transformations, form an ε-dimension expander if for every subspace
k
W of F n with dim(W ) ≤ nn , dim
i=1 Ti (W ) ≥ (1 + ε) dim W . For motivation,
see [DS]. Again, when one can talk about “probability” (e.g., if F is a ﬁnite or
local ﬁeld), “random” T1 , . . . , Tk ∈ EndF (F n ) = Mn (F ) will give rise to dimension
expanders. Wigderson asked for explicit constructions, which are more diﬃcult to
construct. This was done in [LZ] for characteristic zero ﬁelds and in [B1] for the
general case. This motivates the study of “algebras with property (τ )” such as the
amenable algebras in [Ba] and [E].
(IV) High-dimensional expanders. A natural problem, which has been
mentioned for a good number of years is: What is the natural deﬁnition for higherdimensional expanders? A suggestion for such a deﬁnition was given in [Gro2]
and [Gro3] (which formally speaking does not reduce to an expander for dimension
one, but it still keeps the spirit of expanders). In [FGLNP], random and explicit
constructions of such high dimensional expanders are given. The latter is based on
[LSV2].
(V) The distribution of integer points on spheres. The set of integral
solutions
Hd = {(x, y, z) ∈ Z3 |x2 + y 2 + z 2 = d} can be normalized by dividing by
√
d to give a subset of the sphere S 2 . The distribution of these points on the sphere
was studied by Linnik, and a modern treatment with stronger results is given in
[EMV]. The modern approach makes use of random walks on expander graphs.
(VI) Counting rational solutions on curves. Expanders are used in a
surprising way in [EHK] to show some strong ﬁniteness results on the number of
k-rational points on some families of curves over number ﬁelds of bounded degree.
This is related to the notion of “gonality” of a curve X (i.e., the minimal degree
of a meromorphic function on X, or the minimal d such that X is realized as a
ramiﬁed cover of the plane). Zograf [Z1], [Z2] showed that if a family of covers of a
ﬁxed hyperbolic surface has (τ ), then the gonality grows linearly with the volume.
(VII) C ∗ -algebras. For a Hilbert space H, denote by B(H) the C ∗ -algebra of
the bounded operators of H. In [Va1], Ramanujan graphs were used to study the
diﬀerent possible norms on B(H) ⊗ B(H). In [BeSz], property (τ ) is used to give
explicit examples of n × n matrices of norm 1 which cannot be well approximated
by matrices that decompose into direct sums of smaller matrices.
In another direction, property (τ ) has been used to study the question whether
the set of ﬁnite-dimensional representations of the C ∗ -algebra C ∗ (Γ) of a ﬁnitely
generated group separates the points of C ∗ (Γ) (see [Be] and [LSh]). Finally, we
mention here [Bue], which describes property τ for von Neumann algebras.
(VIII) Random 3-manifolds. In [DT], Dunﬁeld and Thurston presented a
model for “random 3-manifolds”. It is based on the fact (explained in §6.3) that
every 3-manifold M has a (non-unique) Heegaard splitting, i.e., obtained by gluing

two handle-bodies along their boundaries. The elements of the mapping class group
MCG(g) of a surface of genus g give rise to 3-manifolds of Heegaard genus at most
g. Random walks on MCG(g) give therefore “random” 3-manifolds. The group
sieve method presented in Section 5 has already been used for studying the group
MCG(g) and in [Ko1] and [Ko2] it is used to give some results on the ﬁrst homology
of 3-manifolds. It seems to have a great potential for studying further properties
of “random 3-manifolds”.
We hope to return to this topic in the future.
