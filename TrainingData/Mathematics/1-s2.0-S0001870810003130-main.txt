1. Introduction
This paper is concerned with the existence, uniqueness and properties of solutions u = u(x, t)
to the Cauchy problem

for exponents m > 0, in space dimension N 1, and with initial value f ∈ L1 (RN ). By a solution it is meant a suitable concept of weak or strong solution. In particular, we prove that
u ∈ C([0, ∞) : L1 (RN )) and that the equation is satisfied a.e. in Q = RN × (0, ∞). The sign
requirement u 0 is not strictly needed but when enforced some additional properties hold.
We recall that the nonlocal operator (− )1/2 is defined for any function g in the Schwartz
class through the Fourier transform,
ˆ ),
(− )1/2 g(ξ ) = |ξ |g(ξ

(1.2)

or via the Riesz potential,
(− )1/2 g(x) = CN P.V.
RN

g(x) − g(y)
dy,
|x − y|N +1

(1.3)

where CN = π − 2 Γ ( N 2+1 ) is a normalization constant, see for example [29,35].
Equations of this form can be considered as nonlinear variations of the linear fractional diffusion equation obtained for m = 1, which is a model of so-called anomalous diffusion, a much
studied topic in physics, probability and finance, see for instance [1,26,28,30,39,40] and the references therein. We recall that fractional Laplacian operators of the form (− )σ/2 , σ ∈ (0, 2),
are infinitesimal generators of stable Lévy processes [4,12]. The analysis of the linear equation in
the whole space is easy since an integral representation can be used for the solutions, see below.
Such a representation is not available in the nonlinear case.
Interest in studying the nonlinear model we propose is two-fold: on the one hand, experts in
the mathematics of diffusion want to understand the combination of fractional operators with
porous medium type propagation, and on the other hand models of this kind arise in statistical
mechanics [27] and heat control [6]. The rigorous study of such nonlinear models has been
delayed by mathematical difficulties in treating at the same time the nonlinearity and fractional
diffusion.
Observe that the above equation becomes the well-known Porous Medium Equation (PME)
when replacing the nonlocal diffusion operator (− )1/2 by the classical Laplacian − . A number of techniques in dealing with the present nonlinear fractional diffusion model will be borrowed from the experience obtained with the PME, see for instance [37]. Our original purpose
was to study Problem (1.1) for every m > 1, to examine the existence and properties of “fractional slow diffusion”. But the development of the theory allows to cover with a reasonable
additional effort the “fast diffusion cases”, m < 1, on the condition that we restrict the exponent
to be larger than a critical value, m > m∗ ≡ (N − 1)/N . This critical value is intrinsic to the
equation, it appears in various contexts of the theory. It corresponds to the classical critical value
N+1

m∗ = (N − 2)+ /N in the PME case, see [10]. Existence of a weak solution is however proved
for every m > 0, for data which are moreover bounded.
H ARMONIC EXTENSIONS. Besides formulae (1.2) and (1.3), there is another way of computing
the half Laplacian, through the so-called Dirichlet to Neumann operator. If g = g(x) is a smooth
bounded function defined in RN , we consider its harmonic extension v = v(x, y) to the upper
+1
half-space RN
+ , v = E(g), i.e., the unique smooth bounded solution to
= 0,
v(x, 0) = g(x),
x,y v

x ∈ RN , y > 0,
x ∈ RN .

(1.4)

Then,

∂v
(x, 0) = (−

g(x),

(1.5)

where x,y is the Laplacian in all (x, y) variables and x acts only on the x variables (in the
sequel we will drop the subscripts when no confusion arises). In order to check (1.5), just apply
the operator in the right-hand side twice. The choice of sign for the normal derivative makes the
operator positive. Observe that the extension operator is well defined in H 1/2 (RN ), and so is the
Dirichlet to Neumann operator, which coincides with (− )1/2 in this more general setting. This
well-known technique has been recently used in several situations, see for instance [17,18,33].
P ROBLEM - SETTING. By means of the above-mentioned harmonic extension we rewrite, for
smooth solutions, the nonlocal Problem (1.1) in a “local way” (i.e., using local differential operators) as a quasi-stationary problem with a dynamical boundary condition. Indeed, w = |u|m−1 u
satisfies

⎩
w(x, 0, 0) = f m (x)
for x ∈ RN .
This problem has been recently considered by Athanasopoulos and Caffarelli [6]. They prove
that bounded weak energy solutions to (1.6) are Hölder continuous if m > 1. The existence and
uniqueness of that kind of solutions is one of the outcomes of the present paper. We also quote
the work [3], where a more general problem is considered, though in a bounded domain, instead
of in the half space.
The connection between problems with dynamical boundary conditions and nonlocal equations has already been exploited in [38] in the case of a bounded domain, and in [2] for a
+1
semilinear problem in the half-space RN
+ . However, in those works the study of the nonlocal
equation is used to obtain properties of the local one. Here, our approach is exactly the opposite.
R ESULTS AND ORGANIZATION. Our purpose is to establish a theory of existence, uniqueness,
comparison and regularity for suitable weak solutions of Problem (1.1) with initial data f ∈
L1 (RN ). The full theory works for values of m larger than the critical value m∗ mentioned above,
but basic existence and uniqueness holds for all m > 0, for data which are moreover bounded.
Section 2 contains preliminaries, the basic definitions of solutions, and a list of main results.
We define the concept of weak solution to Problem (1.1) through the standard concept of weak
solution to the associated local Problem (1.6). We also define the concept of strong solution.

1381

We establish the existence of weak solutions in Section 3 by means of Semigroup Theory,
solving first some associated elliptic problem, under the condition that the initial data f are both
integrable and bounded. Actually, the obtained solution is strong and the equation is satisfied
almost everywhere. We also prove in this context an L1 –L∞ estimate that will be basic for the
so-called smoothing effect.
Uniqueness is studied in Section 4. Section 5 deals with further properties of the constructed
solution. It includes conservation of mass, positivity and regularity. At this point we use the
continuity result from [6] to show that solutions to (1.1) corresponding to nonnegative initial
data become immediately strictly positive if m > 1. This is a remarkable property since it departs
from the well-known properties of the standard PME, cf. [37]. On the other hand, for m∗ < m < 1
we are able to prove the expected positivity property using a different approach. This is used later,
in combination with boundedness and a result in [6] to prove Hölder continuity also in this case.
Let us notice that, unlike in the local case, there is still no general regularity result for linear
nonlocal equations (with reasonable coefficients) guaranteeing that positive bounded solutions
to Problem (1.1) are in fact C ∞ , though this is expected to be true.
After such a work, we are able to treat general solutions with data in L1 (RN ) in Section 6.
Here we complete the proof of uniform boundedness of the solutions with integrable data for
positive times, the L1 –L∞ smoothing effect.
In Section 7 we study the continuous dependence of the solution in terms of the exponent m
and the data f , in the case m > m∗ . In particular, we show that the linear case m = 1 can be
obtained as a limit of the nonlinear case both from above and below.
Section 8 contains a brief description of alternative approaches to the existence theory and an
announcement of extensions. Finally, Appendix A gathers some technical lemmas.
N OTICE ON THE LINEAR CASE. For the value of the parameter m = 1 we obtain the equation
∂u
+ (− )1/2 u = 0.

(1.7)

This is a linear fractional heat equation where the fractional derivatives act only on the space
variable. It is explicitly solvable in terms of the initial value, u(x, 0) = f (x), through convolution

(|x − z|2 + t 2 )(N +1)/2

(1.8)

where CN is the constant in (1.3). Note that this corresponds to an anomalous diffusion law of
the form x ∼ t α with α = 1 instead of the standard α = 1/2 of the Brownian case.
+1
N OTATIONS. In dealing with extended functions, we denote the upper half-space, RN
+ , by Ω,
N
and write its points as x = (x, y), x ∈ R , y > 0. We denote by Γ the boundary of Ω, i.e., Γ =
RN × {0}, which is identified to the original RN with variable x. We consider also the extension
and trace operators, E, Tr: for a function v ∈ H 1/2 (Γ ), we denote its harmonic extension to Ω
as E(v); notice that E(v) ∈ H 1 (Ω); on the other hand, given a function z ∈ H 1 (Ω), we denote
its trace on Γ , which belongs to H 1/2 (Γ ), as Tr(z).
As in the PME theory, we will be mostly interested in nonnegative data and solutions. However, the basic theory can be developed for data of any sign, and in that case we will use the
simplified notation um instead of the “odd power” |u|m−1 u, and we will also use such a notation

1382

when m is replaced by 1/m. In fact, we will show that if the initial value is nonnegative, then
the weak solution we construct is also nonnegative, u 0, which helps justify our abbreviated
notations.
2. Preliminaries and main results
As mentioned above, we define the concept of weak solution to Problem (1.1) through the
standard concept of weak solution to an associated local problem, which we write here again by
convenience.

Definition 2.1. We say that a pair of functions (u, w) is a weak solution to Problem (2.1) if
1,1

Γ

As is usual, more general test functions can be considered by approximation, whenever the
integrals make sense. Note that the trace u = (Tr(w))1/m is well defined. For brevity we will
refer sometimes to the solution as only u, or even only w, when no confusion arises, since it is
clear how to complete the pair from one of the components, u = (Tr(w))1/m , w = E(um ). By
a weak solution of our original Problem (1.1) we understand u, the first element of the solution
to Problem (2.1).
Observe that the definite advantage of working with the local version is compensated in some
sense by the difficulty of having integrals in (2.2) defined in spaces of different dimensions.

1383

This definition is a very general notion of solution: in this framework we can construct a weak
solution to Problem (2.1) provided the initial value f is integrable and bounded. We restrict
ourselves in the next results to such data. However, weak solutions are sometimes difficult to
work with, and we are not able to prove uniqueness. Hence, a class of solutions with better
properties is welcome. A quite convenient choice is the class of so-called weak energy solutions,
cf. [37] for the standard PME.
Definition 2.2. A weak solution pair (u, w) to Problem (1.1) is said to be a weak energy solution
if moreover w ∈ L2 ([0, T ]; H 1 (Ω)).
Theorem 2.1. Let m > 0. For every f ∈ L1 (RN ) ∩ L∞ (RN ) there exists a unique weak energy
solution to Problem (2.1). Moreover u ∈ C([0, ∞) : L1 (RN )) ∩ L∞ (RN × [0, ∞)).
The importance of this class of solutions, besides having uniqueness, is that, if we restrict to
nonnegative data and exponents m > m∗ = (N − 1)/N , we can obtain regularity and positivity.
Theorem 2.2. Let f ∈ L1 (RN ) ∩ L∞ (RN ) be nonnegative, and assume m > m∗ . Then the weak
energy solution (u, w) to Problem (2.1) satisfies:
(i) Conservation of mass: for every t > 0 we have
u(x, t) dx =
RN

(2.4)

f (x) dx.

RN

(ii) Positivity: u(·, t) > 0 in RN for every t > 0.
(iii) Regularity: there exists some 0 < α < 1 such that u ∈ C α (RN × (0, T )).
(iv) Maximum Principle: if u1 , u2 are solutions with data u01 , u02 and u01
then u1 u2 a.e., in Q = RN × (0, ∞).
(v) Contraction: for any two solutions u1 , u2 with data u01 , u02 we have
u1 (·, t) − u2 (·, t)

L1 (RN )

u01 − u02

L1 (RN ) .

u02 a.e. in RN ,

(2.5)

The restriction m > m∗ is not technical: positivity and conservation of mass are not true if
m < m∗ , see Proposition 5.1. On the other hand, conservation of mass holds also for solutions
with changing sign if m > m∗ . If m > 1 the C α regularity result is true also for any changing
sign solution, [6].
A further interesting property is that the weak energy solutions are strong solutions, which
means that the terms (in principle only distributions) involved in Eq. (2.1) are in fact functions,
and equalities hold almost everywhere. The main technical difficulty is to prove that ∂t u is a function.
Theorem 2.3. In the hypotheses of Theorem 2.2 we have ∂t u ∈ L1 (RN ).

1384

A. de Pablo et al. / Advances in Mathematics 226 (2011) 1378–1409

We observe that for strong solutions we can multiply (2.1) by any integrable function to get,
instead of (2.2), the following identity
∂u
ϕ dx = 0.
∂t

(2.6)

Γ

Working with strong solutions we can use the solution itself as a test function in formula (2.6).
In particular this allows us to obtain a universal bound for all solutions with the same mass.
Theorem 2.4. Let f ∈ L1 (RN ) ∩ L∞ (RN ), and assume m > m∗ . Then, there exists a positive
constant C such that the weak energy solution to Problem (2.1) satisfies
sup u(x, t)

Ct −γ f

x∈RN

γ /N
L1 (RN )

(2.7)

with γ = (m − 1 + 1/N)−1 . The constant C depends only on N and m.
G ENERAL INTEGRABLE DATA. Once this theory is settled, we are interested in considering all
integrable functions f as possible data in Problem (1.1). As we have advanced, this can be managed by approximation by bounded initial data, and this is possible if we have an L1 -contraction
at hand. We thus introduce the concept of L1 energy solution: a weak solution, continuous in L1 ,
which is also an energy solution for positive times.
Definition 2.3. We say that a weak solution (u, w) to Problem (2.1) is an L1 -energy solution if
u ∈ C([0, ∞) : L1 (RN )) and |∇w| ∈ L2 (Ω × [τ, ∞)), for every τ > 0.
The L1 -contraction property for L1 -energy solutions is as follows.
Theorem 2.5. Let (u, w) and (u,
˜ w)
˜ be two L1 -energy solutions to Problem (2.1). Then, for every
0 t1 < t 2 ,

˜ t2 )

˜ t1 )

(2.8)

RN

We have that, when performing the approximation by problems with bounded data, the limit
function obtained is an L1 -energy solution. Now, since estimate (2.7) does not depend on the
L∞ norm of the data, it is also true for the limit solution (for changing sign solutions it holds by
comparison). In particular this represents an L1 –L∞ smoothing effect that allows to obtain the
same properties of Theorem 2.2 for positive times.
Theorem 2.6. Let m > m∗ . Then for every f ∈ L1 (RN ) there exists a unique L1 -energy solution
to Problem (2.1). It satisfies estimate (2.7) and the conservation of mass (2.4). If moreover f 0,
positivity and regularity also hold, and the solution is strong. The maps St : f → u(t) generate
a nonlinear semigroup of order-preserving contractions in L1 (RN ).
The next sections of the paper are devoted to treat the case of bounded data. In Section 6
we drop this restriction and deal by approximation with general L1 data. We point out that the

A. de Pablo et al. / Advances in Mathematics 226 (2011) 1378–1409

1385

continuous dependence of the solutions constructed above with respect to the initial data and the
exponent is stated and proved in Section 7.
3. Weak solutions
We set out to construct a weak solution to the extended local Problem (2.1) taking initial
values f ∈ L1 (Γ ) ∩ L∞ (Γ ). We point out that the construction of a weak solution can be made
for every m > 0 and data not necessarily signed.
A well-known method of construction of solutions of evolution equations, and also of generating a semigroup in a convenient functional space, is the so-called Implicit Time Discretization.
It runs as follows: if the evolution equation is dv/dt + A(v) = 0, where A is a linear or nonlinear, bounded or unbounded operator acting on a Banach space X , and given initial data
v(0) = f ∈ X , then the construction of an approximate solution of the problem in a time interval [0, T ] proceeds dividing the time interval [0, T ] in n subintervals of length ε = T /n and
then defining the approximate solution vε constant on each subinterval in the following way: in
each interval (tk−1 , tk ], tk = kε, k = 1, . . . , n, we consider the solution vε,k to the discretized
problem
1
(vε,k − vε,k−1 ) + A(vε,k ) = 0.
ε

(3.1)

We take as starting condition vε,0 = fε , an approximation of f . In the case of linear operators, a variant of the Hille–Yosida Theorem ensures the convergence of these approximate
solutions to the so-called mild solution of the evolution problem when the operator A satisfies some properties, like being maximal monotone, cf. [14]. The convergence result in the case
of nonlinear and possibly unbounded operators is given by the famous Crandall–Liggett Theorem [21] under the assumption that A must be accretive and satisfy a certain rank condition.
(Reminder: a possibly nonlinear and unbounded operator A : D(A) ⊂ X → X is called accretive
if for every ε > 0 the map I + εA is one-to-one onto a subspace Rε (A) ⊂ X and the inverse
R(ε, A) := (I + εA)−1 : Rε (A) → X is a contraction in the X -norm. The precise rank condition
that we will use is Rε (A) ⊃ D(A) for every ε > 0.)
One of the typical examples of such theory is the standard PME posed on the whole space or
on a bounded domain with homogeneous boundary conditions. The early work due to Bénilan
and collaborators, [8], drew attention to this important results, as well as the application to more
general nonlinear diffusion-convection models.
We will apply such a strategy to our evolution Problem (2.1). The discretized problem is:
Given f ∈ L1 (Γ ) ∩ L∞ (Γ ) and ε > 0, to find uε = {uε,1 , . . . , uε,n } by solving for k =
1, . . . , n the problem

with initial value uε,0 = f on Γ . In each such step, uε,k−1 = (Tr(wε,k−1 ))1/m is known and
uε,k and wε,k = E(um
ε,k ) are the unknowns.

1386

A. de Pablo et al. / Advances in Mathematics 226 (2011) 1378–1409

The second equation in (3.2) can be written as
uε,k + εA(uε,k ) = uε,k−1 ,

(3.3)

where the operator A : D(A) ⊂ L1 (Γ ) → L1 (Γ ) is defined as

To prove this we perform an approximation substituting the unbounded domain Ω by an
increasing sequence of bounded domains ΩR (half balls), imposing zero Dirichlet condition
on the part of the boundary of the domain which does not lie on the hyperplane y = 0. The

corresponding bounded domains.

Theorem 3.1. For every g ∈ L1 (Γ ) ∩ L∞ (Γ ) there exists a unique weak solution w ∈ H 1 (Ω) to

S TEP 3. In order to pass to the limit R → ∞ in the case of nonnegative data, we use a
monotonicity property of the family of approximate solutions, denoted here by wR . Namely,
R < R implies wR wR in ΩR . This follows from the ordering of the restrictions, using again
that the Poisson kernel is nonnegative. The ordering of the restrictions results from comparison
0 in ΣR (there is a contraction property analogous to (3.10) for problems
in ΓR , since wR
with non-homogeneous boundary data).
Monotonicity implies that there exists the pointwise (and also in the sense of distributions)
limit w = limR→∞ wR . This limit satisfies w 0 in Ω, (Tr(w))1/m ∈ L1 (Γ ) ∩ L∞ (Γ ). Since

S TEP 4. The pass to the limit in the case of non-positive data uses a similar argument. Finally,
in the case of data g of both signs, we use comparison with the solutions with data g1 = g + 0
and g2 = −g − 0 and compactness to pass to the limit.
S TEP 5. Contractivity for the limit problem is proved exactly in the same way as for the
approximate problems. This gives uniqueness. We also have that the L1 norm and the L∞ norm
of the function w 1/m (·, 0) are bounded respectively by the L1 norm and the L∞ norm of the
datum. ✷
3.2. Existence of solution for the evolution problem
We now use the previously mentioned procedure to construct the solution to the evolution
problem (2.1). We recall that the Crandall–Liggett result only provides us in principle with an
abstract type of solution called mild solution.
Theorem 3.2. For every f ∈ L1 (Γ ) ∩ L∞ (Γ ) there exists a weak solution (u, w) to Problem (2.1) with u(·, t) ∈ L1 (Γ ) ∩ L∞ (Γ ) for every t > 0 and w ∈ L2 ([0, T ]; H 1 (Ω)). Moreover,
the following contractivity property holds: if (u, w), (u,
˜ w)
˜ are the constructed weak solutions
corresponding to initial data f, f˜, then

Proof. For each time T > 0 we divide the time interval [0, T ] in n subintervals. Letting ε =
T /n, we construct the function wε piecewise constant in each interval (tk−1 , tk ], where tk = kε,
k = 1, . . . , n, as the solutions to the discretized Problems (3.2). For convenience we write here
again the problems: wε,k solves

in L1loc (Ω). It is a mild solution, whose existence is guaranteed by the classical semigroup
approach, u ∈ C([0, ∞) : L1 (Γ )). In fact we obtain first the function u by Crandall–Ligget’s
Theorem, and the harmonic extension w of um coincides with limε→0 wε . By construction we
have w ∈ L∞ (Ω × [0, T ]). We must now show that we have obtained in fact a weak solution.
Multiplying the equation by wε,k , integrating by parts, and applying Young’s inequality, we

holds in the sense of distributions.

Proof. We use a simple scaling argument based on the homogeneity of the problem, (see [9], and
m−1
also [5]). Assume first m > 1. We have that for every λ > 1 the function wλ (x, t) = λw(x, λ m t)
is also a solution with initial value bigger than w(·, 0). Then by the comparison principle we get,
lim

λ→1+

wλ (x, t) − w(x, t)

0,

which gives (3.16). For m < 1 the sign is reversed. Comparison can be easily justified in the
discretized approximations. Since the function wλ is the limit of the rescaled approximations of
the function w, we can compare w and wλ . ✷

Formula (3.16) is empty for m = 1, but in this case it is easy to derive from the explicit representation of the solution that t∂t u + N u 0.
Remark. In the PME model (the local analogue), a similar lower estimate of ∂t u is also available
in the case m < 1. The proof uses in an essential way a second variable called the pressure, which
is a potential for the velocity. It is not clear which could be the corresponding pressure for the
nonlocal problem.
4. Uniqueness of weak energy solutions
In the previous section we have constructed a weak solution to the local Problem (2.1). As we
have said, the construction itself shows that this weak solution is in fact a weak energy solution.
We prove uniqueness using an argument taken from Oleinik et al. [31].
Lemma 4.1. Assume f ∈ L1 (RN ) ∩ L∞ (RN ). There is at most one weak energy solution to
Problem (1.1).
Proof. Let (u, w) and (u,
˜ w)
˜ be two weak solutions to Problem (2.1). We take as test, in the
weak formulation, the following function
T

ϕ(x, t) =

(w − w)(x,
˜

t

with ϕ ≡ 0 for t T . Observe that this is a good test function when w and w˜ are weak energy
solutions. We have

Since both terms are nonnegative, they must be zero. Therefore, u = u˜ in Γ . Obviously this also
gives, as a byproduct, w = w˜ in Ω. ✷
Remark. Observe that this proof only requires u(·, t), u(·,
˜ t) ∈ L1 (RN ) ∩ Lm+1 (RN ).
5. Properties of weak energy solutions
In the next sections we restrict ourselves to the range m > m∗ .
5.1. Conservation of mass
We establish next a property that is typical of diffusive processes.
Theorem 5.1. If (u, w) is a weak energy solution to Problem (2.1) with initial datum f , then for
every t > 0 we have
u(x, t) dx =
RN

f (x) dx.

(5.1)

RN

Proof. The case m = 1 follows from the explicit representation (1.8). For general m we use the
integral identity (2.2) with a particular test function. Consider a nonnegative nonincreasing cutoff function ψ(s) such that ψ(s) = 1 for 0 s 1, ψ(s) = 0 for s 2, and define ϕR (x) =
ψ(|x|/R). We obtain, for every t2 > t1 0,
t2

∇w(x, t), ∇ϕR (x) dx dt.

u(x, t2 ) − u(x, t1 ) ϕR (x, 0) dx = −

Integrating by parts, noting that

With the test function chosen we have

Finally observe that if m > m∗ we can choose 1/m < p < N/(N − 1) to force the last term to
go to zero as R → ∞. ✷
S OLUTIONS THAT LOSE MASS. We now present a result that shows the necessity of the condition
m > m∗ . In fact if 0 < m < m∗ there is a phenomenon of extinction in finite time, which makes
impossible to have conservation of mass. The proof is almost exactly the same as the one in [10]
for the PME model, where the corresponding condition on m is 0 < m < (N − 2)/N instead of
0 < m < m∗ = (N − 1)/N .
Proposition 5.1. Let N > 1 and 0 < m < (N − 1)/N , and let f ∈ L1 (RN ) ∩ L(1−m)N (RN ).
Then there is a finite time T > 0 such that the solution u to Problem (1.1) satisfies u(x, T ) ≡ 0
in RN .
Proof. As we have said, the proof follows the argument in [10]. Therefore we leave the details
to be consulted there. Assume also for simplicity u 0.

If we now choose p = (N (1 − m) − 1)/m > 0, we get ((p + 1)mN )/(N − 1) = pm + 1. Therefore, the function J (t) = Γ upm+1 dx satisfies the inequality
J (t) + CJ

This implies extinction in finite time for J (t) and thus for u(x, t), provided J (0) is finite.

✷

Example. There exists an explicit example of the above extinction property for a particular
m < m∗ . It has the form (separated variables),
u(x, t) = G(x)H (t).
Substituting this expression in (1.1), we have H (t) = c(T − t)1/(1−m) , and G solves the nonlocal
equation
(− )1/2 Gm = G.
In the special case m = (N − 1)/(N + 1), there exists an explicit family of solutions
Gδ,τ = A(τ ) τ 2 + |x − δ|2

−(N +1)/2

,

with τ > 0, δ ∈ RN and where A(τ ) > 0 has an explicit expression, see [13] and also [19].
Observe that m < m∗ and G ∈ L1 (RN ), and thus u(·, t) ∈ L1 (RN ) for any 0 t < T , while
u(x, T ) ≡ 0.
5.2. Positivity and regularity
We show in this subsection that nonnegative bounded weak energy solutions are in fact positive everywhere in Ω. This is true for every m > m∗ . The result is in sharp contrast with what
happens for the local analog, the PME ∂t u = um in the case m > 1, for which initial values with
compact support produce solutions that develop a free boundary. Free boundaries are a main feature of the standard PME theory, but they are not available here.
The idea behind our positivity result is as follows: if u 0 is a classical solution and
u(x0 , t) = 0 for some x0 and t, then formula (1.3) gives (− )1/2 um (x0 , t) < 0, and hence
∂t u(x0 , t) > 0. If m > 1 we only have that the bounded solution u is Hölder continuous by [6].
In the case m < 1 we do not even have that regularity. Now we perform rigorously the proof of
positivity for weak solutions using the extension Problem (2.1).

A. de Pablo et al. / Advances in Mathematics 226 (2011) 1378–1409

1395

Theorem 5.2. Assume m > m∗ . The weak energy solution u to Problem (1.1) with a bounded
nonnegative initial datum is positive for positive times. Even more, the corresponding pair (u, w)
to Problem (2.1) satisfies w(x, y, t) > 0 for every x ∈ RN , y 0 and every t > 0.
Proof. The case m = 1 follows from formula (1.8).
C ASE m > 1: We already know that for every t > 0, function w is Hölder continuous, w 0
in Ω, and w > 0 in Ω. We have to prove that w > 0 also on the boundary, Γ . By the comparison
result, we only need to consider compactly supported initial data.
In a first step we show that if w is not strictly positive on Γ at some time T , then the supports
of w(·, 0, t) form an expanding (in time) family of compact sets for 0 t T . This follows from
estimate (3.17) and Alexandrov’s reflection principle. In fact (3.17) implies that
w(x, t2 )

t1
t2

w(x, t1 )

m/(m−1)

,

for every x ∈ Ω, t2 t1 > 0, which is called retention property. Next we claim that if the support
of the initial value f is contained in the ball BR , and w(x0 , 0, t0 ) = 0 for some x0 ∈ RN , t0 > 0,
then the support of w(·, 0, t) is also compact for any 0 < t t0 , and contained in a ball of radius
depending on |x0 | and R.
To prove the claim we reflect, for any given point (x1 , y) ∈ Ω, around the hyperplane
π ≡ (x1 − x0 ) · (x − (x0 + x1 )/2) = 0. It is clear that if |x0 − (x0 + x1 )/2| > |x0 | + R, then
the hyperplane π divides the half-space Ω in two parts, Ω = M1 ∪ M2 with BR × [0, ∞) ⊂ M1 ,
(x0 , 0) ∈ M2 . In this way, by the comparison principle, we obtain that the function z(x, y, t) =
w(x, y, t) − w(x0 + x1 − x, y, t) satisfies z(x, y, t) 0 for every (x, y) ∈ M1 , t > 0. The
comparison principle holds on the half-space M1 . Thus w(x1 , 0, t) w(x0 , 0, t) = 0 for every
0 < t t0 . A sufficient condition for x1 to get this argument work is |x1 | 3|x0 | + 2R.
In a second step we assume (thanks to the previous argument) that w(x, 0, t) ≡ 0 in some ball
B ⊂ Γ for 0 t t1 . Then we have, for every test function ϕ that vanishes on ∂B × (0, ∞), that

This gives ∂y w(x, 0, t) ≡ 0 for x ∈ B, 0 t t1 . But w is a continuous nonnegative harmonic
function in the half cylinder which vanishes on the part of the boundary y = 0. Hopf’s Lemma
implies ∂y w(x, 0, t) < 0 for x ∈ B. This is a contradiction. Therefore, w(·, 0, t) is positive everywhere.
C ASE m < 1: In this case the proof is different, based on a weak Harnack inequality. Using
estimate (3.17) and the fact that the solution is bounded, we know that for every t > 0 there exists
a constant A > 0 such that
∇w, ∇ϕ + A

R 2 } ⊂ RN +1 with center on Γ . First of all, conservation of mass plus (3.15), together with the
fact that w 0, w ≡ 0, imply that there exists some R > 0 large such that BR/2 w dx > 0.
If we consider the function
z(x, y) = e−A|y| w x, |y| ,

✷

As a corollary of this result, we can establish also regularity for the case m < 1, provided
m > m∗ .
Theorem 5.3. Let m∗ < m < 1. Then any bounded weak energy nonnegative solution u to Problem (1.1) satisfies u ∈ C α (RN × (0, ∞)) for some 0 < α < 1.
Proof. The above-mentioned regularity result of [6] applies to the equation
∂β(v)
+ (− )1/2 (v) = 0
∂t
in some ball x ∈ B ⊂ RN , t > 0, with some nondegeneracy condition on the constitutive monotone function β. Once we know that in such a ball the solution is essentially bounded below away
from zero, the requirements on the function β in [6] are fulfilled. ✷
5.3. Strong solutions
We prove here that every nonnegative bounded weak energy solution is in fact a strong solution. We need to show that the time partial derivative of u is an L1 function and that the second
equality in (2.1) holds almost everywhere.
As a first step we show that the time-increment quotients are bounded in L1 (Γ ), and thus the
limit ∂t u must be a Radon measure. Our purpose is to prove that the limit is still in L1 , and this is
proved later. Observe that the result is clear in the case m = 1, from (1.8). We therefore assume
m = 1.
Proposition 5.2. If u is the weak solution to Problem (1.1) constructed in Theorem 2.1, then
h−1 (u(·, t + h) − u(·, t)) ∈ L1 (RN ) for every t, h > 0.

A. de Pablo et al. / Advances in Mathematics 226 (2011) 1378–1409

1397

The proof is exactly the same as in the PME case, see [9]. In fact, the following estimate holds

L1 (RN ) .

(5.2)

An analogous result for more general nonlinearities is given in [22].
Observe that by the Mean Value Theorem, the same type of estimate can be obtained for the
time-increment quotients of w = um if m > 1 since u ∈ L∞ . If m < 1 we obtain a bound locally
for nonnegative solutions, since in each ball of RN we have u c > 0.
We now prove a result which turns out to be fundamental in the proof of Theorem 2.6.
Proposition 5.3. Let f 0 and let u be the weak solution to Problem (1.1) constructed in Theorem 2.1. Then ∂t (u(m+1)/2 ) ∈ L2loc (RN × [0, T ]).
Proof. The formal proof is simple, using the function ∂t w as test function in the weak formulation, much as in the PME case, cf. [37, Section 5.5], of course after some obvious changes. The
problem is the justification of the calculations, since we have not established the existence of any
kind of differentiability for the solutions or suitable approximations.
Here we do by brute force as follows:
• We use the weak formulation with the test function ϕ = δ h (w ∗ ρ), where ρ = η ∗ η and η is
a convolution kernel, acting only on the time variable. We fix the notation fˆ = f ∗ η, f˜ = f ∗ ρ,
applied to functions of t. We also make use of the following calculus identity
f˜(t)g(t) dt =

fˆ(t)g(t)
ˆ dt.

(5.3)

We prove this identity in Lemma A.1 of Appendix A for the reader’s convenience. In addition,
we take η(t) = ηh (t) = (1/ h)η1 (t/ h), where η1 is a smooth, symmetric, compactly supported
nonnegative function, with support [−1, 1]. Thus, ρ = ρh inherits the same properties, with
supp(ρ1 ) = [−2, 2]. We also use the notation
δ h w(t) =

1
w(t + h) − w(t − h)
2h

for a discrete time derivative, omitting the spatial variable. Observe that since |∇w| is in L2 , this
is a good test function.

slightly on the condition that t1 < T1 < T2 < t2 for some fixed 0 < T1 < T2 . We now analyze the

• We turn to the left-hand side terms in (5.4). Assume first m > 1. The second integral in (5.4)
is bounded using Proposition 5.3.

with a positive constant c that depends on m, N and the smoothing kernel η1 . It only remains to
observe that

Letting h → 0, we get ∂t (u 2 ) ∈ L2 (RN × [T1 , T2 ]) for every 0 < T1 < T2 .
• General situation when m > 1: we want to apply Lemma A.2 to I = (w ∗ ρ )(x, t) without
the extra assumption of monotonicity in time, only using that if m > 1, ∂t u −cu. Then we use
the second version of Lemma A.2. An extra term appears but it is controllable.
• In the case m < 1 we need to perform some little extra calculations. First, in order to use
a bound of the form (5.2) for w we take advantage of the fact that w c > 0 in every compact
set of Ω. Thus we consider a new test function by multiplying ϕ by a cutoff function ψ(x). The
extra terms obtained are easily bounded.
On the other hand, formula (5.5) holds with reverse inequality,
I = w ∗ ρ (x, t)

cδ h w(x, t),

(5.6)

provided ∂t w 0, as before. Care has to be taken in the general case, where we use the estimate
∂t w cw. ✷
We now prove the main result.
Theorem 5.4. The weak (nonnegative) solution u to Problem (1.1) constructed in Theorem 2.1
is a strong solution. Moreover,
∂u

(5.7)

Proof. Let w be the weak solution to Problem (2.1) associated to u. We want to prove that the
time derivative of u is actually an integrable function and that the normal derivative of w on Γ
is a distribution. Thus the second equation in (2.1), i.e. Eq. (1.1), holds almost everywhere.
To deal with the normal derivative we only have to take into account that, thanks to the trace
embedding, since for every t > 0 we have w ∈ H 1 (Ω), then ∂y w(·, 0, t) is a distribution in
H −1/2 (Γ ).
We now look at ∂t u(·, t). We use a technical result by Bénilan [7], see also [37]. As in the
previous proof, we may assume ∂t u 0. Also we know that u ∈ L1 (RN ) ∩ L∞ (RN ) for every
t > 0 and finally, from Proposition 5.3 we have ∂t (u(m+1)/2 ) ∈ L2 (RN ).
p
All these estimates allow us to apply Lemma 8.2 in [37] to get ∂t u ∈ Lloc (RN ) for every p ∈
[1, p1 ), where p1 = min{(m + 1)/m), 2}. This gives ∂t u ∈ L1loc (RN ) for every t > 0. Formula
(5.7) follows from (5.2), and in fact ∂t u ∈ L1 (RN ) for every t > 0. ✷

Another consequence of (5.9) is that the norm u(·, t) Lm+1 (RN ) is nonincreasing in time. In
fact this also follows from the elliptic estimates of Section 3.2.
An easy generalization shows the following property.
Proposition 5.6. In the above hypotheses any Lp norm of the solution is nonincreasing in time
for every p 1. Even more, if Ψ is any convex nonnegative real function, then RN Ψ (u(x, t)) dx
is a nonincreasing function.

6. Solutions with data in L1
In order to construct solutions with initial data in L1 we approximate by problems with data
in L1 ∩ L∞ and use the L1 contractivity to pass to the limit (together with the estimates of the
gradients in L2 ).
We begin by proving the bound in L∞ in terms of the L1 norm of the initial datum, estimate (2.7).

6.1. Smoothing effect
Proof of Theorem 2.4. We use a classical parabolic Moser iterative technique, together with the
2N
trace immersion H 1 (Ω) → L N−1 (Γ ). Let t > 0 be fixed, and consider the sequence of times
tk = (1 − 2−k )t. Using the integral formulation of the problem in [tk−1 , tk ] with the test function
ϕ = w q , for some q > 0, we get
tk

We have also used that any Lr -norm of the solution is nonincreasing in time. Therefore we have

where s = N/(N − 1). The constant c(q) can be bounded from below by a positive constant
depending on the minimum value taken by q, as well as on m and N . In order to iterate this
estimate, we put pk = sm(q + 1), and pk−1 = mq + 1, i.e., pk = s(pk−1 + m − 1). If we start
with q = 1/m, thus taking p0 = 2, we easily have pk > pk−1 2, and therefore the constant in
the above estimate can be taken independent of k. Thus, if we denote Uk = u(·, tk ) pk , we have
Uk

Remark. Once we assert that the constant c in (2.7) is universal, then the values of the exponents
γ and γ /N are given as an immediate consequence of the invariance of the equation under the
two-parameter scaling group. This is similar to what happens in the Sobolev inequalities, cf. [24,
p. 262], or what happens in the PME, cf. [36, p. 29].
6.2. L1 contraction
Proof of Theorem 2.5. We first recall that L1 -energy solutions are weak energy solutions for every τ > 0. Therefore, by the trace embedding we have u(·, τ ) ∈ Lp (RN ) for 1 p 2N/(N −1)
if N > 1 (for every p 1 if N = 1). Now condition m > m∗ implies u(·, τ ) ∈ Lm+1 (RN ). This
allows us to use the proof of uniqueness for weak energy solutions, cf. Lemma 4.1 and the
Remark after it, for every τ > 0. Continuity in L1 gives uniqueness up to τ = 0. We now approximate the initial datum f ∈ L1 (RN ) by functions fk ∈ L1 (RN ) ∩ L∞ (RN ), fk → f in L1 (RN ).
The above implies that corresponding solutions uk converge in L1 (RN ) to our solution u, and
the contractivity result in (3.2) passes to the limit. ✷
6.3. End of the proof of Theorem 2.6
Once we have the L1 contraction (2.8) at our disposal, and using the above approximation of u
by uk , we observe that the estimate (2.7) does not depend on the L∞ norm of the approximations,
and thus it is true for the limit.
As to the conservation of mass, we recall that the proof of Theorem 5.1 relies on bounds for
the Lp norms of u(·, t) for t > 0. This is handled with the smoothing effect just proved. We thus
have, repeating the proof of Theorem 5.1,
t

Finally, the proofs of positivity and regularity in Theorems 5.2 and 5.3 also apply using again
the smoothing effect.

7. Continuous dependence
The aim of this section is to prove the continuous dependence of the solutions constructed
in this paper with respect to the initial data f and exponent m. This is true for m > m∗ . Let
us introduce the notation: if u = um,f is the solution corresponding to m and f , we write
S(m, f ) = um,f .
Theorem 7.1. The map S : (m∗ , ∞) × L1 (RN ) → C([0, T ] : L1 (RN )) is continuous.
This will follow from a result of nonlinear Semigroup Theory which states that if each of
An , n = 1, 2, . . . , ∞ is an m-accretive operator in a Banach space X , fn ∈ D(An ) and un is the
solution of
dun
+ An un = 0,
dt

un (0) = fn ,

then An → A∞ , fn → f∞ implies un → u∞ in C([0, ∞) : X ), where An → A means
lim (I + An )−1 g = (I + A∞ )−1 g

n→∞

for all g ∈ X .

See, e.g, [20,24] for statements and references. Hence, the theorem will be a corollary of the
convergence of (I + Amn )−1 , where Am (u) = (− )1/2 um = −∂y w, w = E(um ). This is what
we prove next.
Proposition 7.1. Let {mn }∞
n=1 be a bounded sequence of numbers in (m∗ , ∞) such that
limn→∞ mn = m > m∗ . Then limn→∞ (I + Amn )−1 g = (I + Am )−1 g for all g ∈ L1 (RN ) ∩
L∞ (RN ).
Proof. We borrow ideas from [11]. Note that an analogous result for the PME was proved in
[10]. Let um = (I + Am )−1 g. The L1 -contraction estimate (3.9) implies the bounds
umn

L1 (RN )

umn − τh umn

g

L1 (RN )

L1 (RN ) ,

g − τh g

L1 (RN ) ,

(7.1)

for each h ∈ RN , where (τh v)(x) = v(x + h). This is enough, thanks to Fréchet–Kolmogorov’s
compactness criterium [15], to prove that {umn } is precompact in L1 (K) for each compact set
K ⊂ RN .
To extend compactness to the whole RN we need to control the tails of the solutions uniformly. More precisely, we need to prove that, given > 0, there exists some R > 0 such that
umn L1 (RN \BR (0)) < . This follows from a computation which is very similar to the one in the
proof of Theorem 5.1, but now taking as test function 1 − ϕR instead of ϕR . First observe that
umn = (I + Amn )−1 g means
umn ϕR dx =
Γ

gϕR dx −
Γ

∇wmn , ∇ϕR dx.
Ω

A. de Pablo et al. / Advances in Mathematics 226 (2011) 1378–1409

Therefore, with the above mentioned test function we obtain
g dx + cR −2

umn dx
{|x|>R}

{|x|>R}

wmn dx → 0

{R<|x|<2R}

as R → ∞ uniformly in n, see the proof of Theorem 5.1.
We have obtained that along some subsequence, which we also call {mn }, the following convergence holds
umn → u∗ ,

in L1 (Γ ),

for some function u∗ . Using the Poisson kernel, we also have wmn → w∗ in L1 (Ω), where w∗
is the harmonic extension of um
∗ to the upper half-space. On the other hand, we have a uniform
control in L2 (Ω) of the gradients of w in terms of the data g, see (3.11). Thus, there is weak
convergence in L2 (Ω) of the gradients ∇wmn along some subsequence towards ∇w∗ . All this is
enough to pass to the limit in (7.1) to show that the limit u∗ is indeed um . ✷
Remark. If m > 1, an easier alternative proof can be performed using the compactness results
of [34].
8. Comments and extensions
A LTERNATIVE APPROACHES. It is not difficult to prove a posteriori that the constructed semigroup is also contractive with respect to the norm H −1/2 . This property could be used as a
starting point in the existence and uniqueness theory by using results of the theory of monotone
operators in Hilbert spaces, as developed in [14] for the PME case. We have chosen our present
formulation because we have found a number of advantages in proceeding in this manner.
On the other hand, Crandall and Pierre developed in [22] an abstract approach to study evolution equations of the form ∂t u + Aϕ(u) = 0 when A is an m-accretive operator in L1 and ϕ is
a monotone increasing real function. This allows to obtain a mild solution using the Crandall–
Liggett Theorem. Our problem falls within this framework. Let us point out that such an abstract
construction does not give enough information to prove that the mild solution is in fact a weak
solution, in other words, to identify the solutions in a differential sense.
E XTENSION. As a natural extension of this work we can consider the more general model based
on the equation
∂u
+ (− )σ/2 |u|m−1 u = 0,
∂t

(8.1)

where the fractional Laplacian has an exponent σ ∈ (0, 2), and m > m∗ for some m∗ (N, σ ) ∈
[0, 1). Though the main qualitative results are similar to the ones presented here, the theory of
these fractional operators with σ = 1 has some technical difficulties that make it convenient to be
treated at a second stage. We recall that Caffarelli and Silvestre [18] have recently characterized
the Laplacian of order σ , (− )σ/2 , by means of another auxiliary extension approach. We will
use such an extension in a separate paper, [23], to treat in detail the more general fractional
diffusion model.

for bringing to our attention the paper [22].
Appendix A
We recall some technical results that we have needed in the proof of the property of strong
solutions. The first seems to be well-known.
Lemma A.1. On the condition that η is a smooth convolution kernel with η(−x) = η(x) we have
for every pair of L2 functions in R
h ∗ (η ∗ η) (t)g(t) dt =

(h ∗ η)(t)(g ∗ η)(t) dt.

(A.1)

Lemma A.2. (i) Let g be a positive nondecreasing function. If ρh (t) = (1/ h)ρ1 (t/ h), where ρ1
is a smooth, symmetric, compactly supported nonnegative function, with support [−2, 2], and
δ h g(t) = (g(t + h) − g(t − h))/(2h), then
g ∗ ρh (t)
(ii) If instead of nondecreasing g we have g (t)

cδ h g(t).
−Ag(t), the conclusion is

cδ h g(t) − cAg(t).

g ∗ ρh (t)

(A.2)

(A.3)

Proof. (i) In the case of nondecreasing g we do as follows:
2h

g ∗ ρh (t) =

g(t + s) − g(t − s) −ρ (s) ds
0
2h

g(t + h) − g(t − h) −ρ (s) ds
h
2h

−hρ (s) ds = δ h g(t)ρ1 (1).

h

δ g(t)
h

We pass from the fist to the second line using the positivity of the integrand and the fact that for
s ∈ (h, 2h) we have g(t + s) g(t + h) g(t − h) g(t − s).
(ii) The difference is now that we have to use the weaker inequality g(t + s) g(t)e−As if
s > 0. We have again
2h

g ∗ ρh (t) =

g(t + s) − g(t − s) −ρ (s) ds.
0

A. de Pablo et al. / Advances in Mathematics 226 (2011) 1378–1409

Since g(t + s) − g(t − s)

1407

−g(t)(eAs − e−As ) we get

h

g(t + s) − g(t − s) −ρ (s) ds

and the last integral is bounded uniformly for h small in the form cA. For the other part of the
integral we have

where I1 = h (g(t + h)(1 − e−A(s−h) ) + g(t − h)(eA(s−h) − 1))(−ρ (s)) ds can also be estimated as cAg(t). ✷

Proof. The quotient of the two positive functions F (x) = (x m − 1)(x − 1) and G(x) =
m+1
(x 2 − 1)2 is bounded below away from zero in the interval [1, ∞) unless the limit at x = 1 or
x → ∞ is zero. It is clear that at infinity the limit is 1, whereas at x = 1 we can use L’Hopital to
get

This number is positive and equal or less than 1. The other inequality is similar.
