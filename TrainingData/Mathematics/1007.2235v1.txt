Abstract
The eccentric connectivity index, proposed by Sharma, Goswami and Madan, has
been employed successfully for the development of numerous mathematical models for the
prediction of biological activities of diverse nature. We now report mathematical properties of
the eccentric connectivity index. We establish various lower and upper bounds for the
eccentric connectivity index in terms of other graph invariants including the number of
vertices, the number of edges, the degree distance and the first Zagreb index. We determine
the n-vertex trees of diameter d , 3 ≤ d ≤ n − 2, with the minimum eccentric connectivity index,
and the n-vertex trees of p pendent vertices, 3 ≤ p ≤ n − 2, with the maximum eccentric
connectivity index. We also determine the n-vertex trees with respectively the minimum,
second-minimum and third-minimum, and the maximum, second-maximum and thirdmaximum eccentric connectivity indices for n ≥ 6.

1. INTRODUCTION
A topological index is a numerical descriptor of the molecular structure derived from the
corresponding (hydrogen-depleted) molecular graph. Various topological indices are widely

used for quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) and quantitative structureactivity relationship (QSAR) studies [1-4].
Let G be a simple connected graph with vertex set V (G ). For a vertex u ∈ V (G ),

dG (u ) or du denotes the degree of u , eG (u ) or eu denotes the eccentricity of u in G. Recall
that du is the number of (first) neighbors of u in G, while eu is the path length from u to a
vertex v that is farthest from u , i.e., eu = max{d (u, v | G ) : v ∈ V (G )}, where d (u, v | G )
denotes the distance between u and v in G.
Sharma, Goswami and Madan [5] introduced an adjacency-cum-distance based
topological index, the eccentric connectivity index, of the graph G, defined as

ξ c = ξ c (G ) =

∑

u∈V ( G )

du eu ,

which has been employed successfully for the development of numerous mathematical
models for the prediction of biological activities of diverse nature [5-13], and modified forms
have also been given, for example in [14] by taking into consideration the presence as well as
relative position of the heteroatom(s) in a molecular structure. So it is of interest to study the
mathematical properties of this invariant.
In this paper, we give some basic mathematical properties of the eccentric
connectivity index. We establish various lower and upper bounds in terms of other graph
invariants including the number of vertices, the number of edges, the degree distance and the
first Zagreb index. We determine the n-vertex trees of diameter d , 3 ≤ d ≤ n − 2, with the
minimum eccentric connectivity index, and the n-vertex trees with respectively the minimum,
second-minimum and third-minimum eccentric connectivity indices for n ≥ 6. We also
determine the n-vertex trees of p pendent vertices, 3 ≤ p ≤ n − 2, with the maximum
eccentric connectivity index, and the n-vertex trees with respectively the maximum, secondmaximum and third-maximum eccentric connectivity indices for n ≥ 6. It appears that the
eccentric connectivity index satisfies the basic requirement to be a branching index.

2. PRELIMINARIES

For a connected graph G, the radius r (G ) and diameter D(G ) are, respectively, the
minimum and maximum eccentricity among vertices of G. A connected graph is called a self-

centered graph if all of its vertices have the same eccentricity [15]. Then a connected graph
G is self-centered if and only if r (G ) = D(G ).

Let Pn and Sn be respectively the path and the star with n vertices. Let K n be the
complete graph with n vertices. Let Cn be the cycle with n ≥ 3 vertices. Let K r ,s be the
complete bipartite graph with r vertices in one vertex-class and s vertices in the other
vertex-class.
By direct calculation, the following formulae hold: ξ c ( K n ) = n(n − 1), ξ c ( K r , s ) = 4rs

3. RESULTS FOR GENERAL GRAPHS

In this section, we give lower and upper bounds for the eccentric connectivity index of
connected graphs in terms of graph invariants such as the number of vertices, the number of
edges, the radius, the diameter, the degree distance and the first Zagreb index.

Proposition 1. Let G be a connected graph with m edges. Then

2mr (G ) ≤ ξ c (G ) ≤ 2mD(G )

with either equality if and only if G is a self-centered graph.

Proof. Note that

∑

u∈V ( G )

du = 2m. It is easily seen that ξ c (G ) =

∑

u∈V ( G )

du eu ≤

∑

u∈V ( G )

d u D(G )

= 2mD(G ) with equality if and only if eu = D(G ) for any u ∈ V (G ), i.e., G is a selfcentered graph. The lower bound follows similarly by using eu ≥ r (G ) for u ∈ V (G ).
Let G be a connected graph with m edges. If r (G ) ≥ 2, then by Proposition 1,

ξ c (G ) ≥ 4m with equality if and only if G is a self-centered graph of radius two. The selfcentered graphs with radius two of minimum size have been characterized [15, Theorem 2.7].
Corollary 1. Let G be a connected graph with n ≥ 4 vertices for which the complement G

is also connected. Then

ξ c (G ) + ξ c (G ) ≥ 2n(n − 1)

with equality if and only if both G and G are self-centered graphs with radius two.

Proof. Let m and m be respectively the number of edges of G and G. Evidently,

2(m + m) = n(n − 1). Since both G and G are connected, each has radius at least two, and
then by Proposition 1,

ξ c (G ) + ξ c (G ) ≥ 4m + 4m = 2n(n − 1)
with equality if and only if G and G are self-centered, and r (G ) = r (G ) = 2.

If G is a connected graph with n vertices and m edges, and the number of vertices
of degree n − 1 in G is equal to k , where 0 ≤ k ≤ n, then it is easily seen that

ξ c (G ) ≥ (n − 1)k + 2[2m − k (n − 1)] = 4m − k (n − 1) with equality if and only if all the n − k

vertices of degree less than n − 1 have eccentricity two. We use this fact in the proofs of
Propositions 2 and 3.
A 3-vertex connected graph is either S3 or K 3 , for which ξ c ( S3 ) = ξ c ( K 3 ) = 3(n − 1).
Proposition 2. Let G be an n-vertex connected graph, where n ≥ 4. Then ξ c (G ) ≥ 3(n − 1)

with equality if and only if G = Sn .
Proof. Let m be the number of edges, and k the number of vertices of degree n − 1 in G,

where 0 ≤ k ≤ n. Then ξ c (G ) ≥ 4m − k (n − 1) with equality if and only if all the n − k
vertices of degree less than n − 1 have eccentricity two.
If k = 0, then ξ c (G ) ≥ 2mr (G ) ≥ 4m ≥ 4(n − 1) > 3(n − 1). Suppose that k ≥ 1. Note
that all vertices of G except the ones with degree n − 1 are of degree at least k . We have

2m ≥ k (n − 1) + k (n − k ), and thus,

ξ c (G ) ≥ 2[k (n − 1) + k (n − k )] − k (n − 1) = k (3n − 2k − 1).
Obviously, the function f ( x) = x(3n − 2 x − 1) with 1 ≤ x ≤ n attains the minimum value for
x = 1 or n. Note that f (1) = 3(n − 1) < n(n − 1) = f (n). Hence, ξ c (G ) ≥ f (1) = 3(n − 1) with

equality if and only if k = 1 and m = n − 1, i.e., G = Sn .
Denote by G ∨ H the graph formed from vertex-disjoint graphs G and H by adding
edges between each vertex in G and each vertex in H . For positive integers n and m with
⎢ 2n − 1 − (2n − 1) 2 − 8m ⎥
⎛n⎞
n − 1 ≤ m < ⎜ ⎟ , let a = an , m = ⎢
⎥ . Then a < n. Let G ( n,m) be the set of
2
⎢⎣
⎥⎦
⎝2⎠

⎛a⎞
graphs K a ∨ H , where H is a graph with n − a vertices and m − ⎜ ⎟ − a (n − a ) edges. Note
⎝2⎠
that a is the largest integer satisfying 2m ≥ a ( n − 1) + a ( n − a ), i.e., h(a) ≥ 0 with

⎡
⎤
⎛a⎞
1
h(a) = a 2 − 2na + a + 2m, we have ⎢ m − ⎜ ⎟ − a(n − a ) ⎥ − (n − a − 1) = h(a + 1) < 0. Thus,
2
⎝2⎠
⎣
⎦
each vertex of H has eccentricity two in K a ∨ H .

Proposition 3. Let G be an n-vertex connected graph with m edges, where n − 1 ≤ m
⎢ 2n − 1 − (2n − 1) 2 − 8m ⎥
⎛n⎞
< ⎜ ⎟ . Let a = ⎢
⎥ . Then
2
⎢⎣
⎥⎦
⎝2⎠

ξ c (G ) ≥ 4m − a(n − 1)
with equality if and only if G ∈ G ( n ,m ) .

Proof. It may be easily checked that a ≥ 1. Let k be the number of vertices of degree n − 1
in G, where 0 ≤ k ≤ n − 1. If k = 0, then ξ c (G ) ≥ 4m > 4m − a(n − 1). Suppose that k ≥ 1.
Then ξ c (G ) ≥ 4m − k (n − 1) with equality if and only if all the n − k vertices of degree less
than n − 1 have eccentricity two. Note that 2m ≥ k (n − 1) + k (n − k ) and a is the largest
integer satisfying 2m ≥ a ( n − 1) + a ( n − a ). We have k ≤ a, and thus ξ c (G ) ≥ 4m − a (n − 1)
with equality if and only if G has exactly a vertices of degree n − 1 and all other vertices
have eccentricity two, i.e., G ∈ G ( n ,m ) .

Note that for n ≥ 4, an,n = 1 and G ( n ,n ) contains exactly the unicyclic graph formed
by adding an edge to the star S n , and for n ≥ 5, an , n +1 = 1 and G ( n , n +1) contains exactly two
bicyclic graphs formed by adding two edges to the star Sn . Thus, by Proposition 3, we have

Corollary 2. Let G be a unicyclic graph with n ≥ 4 vertices. Then

ξ c (G ) ≥ 3n + 1
with equality if and only if G is formed by adding an edge to the star Sn .
Corollary 3. Let G be a bicyclic graph with n ≥ 5 vertices. Then

ξ c (G ) ≥ 3n + 5

with equality if and only if G is formed by adding two edges to the star Sn .
Corollaries 2 and 3 also follow from Proposition 1: For a unicyclic graph G with
n ≥ 4 vertices, if r (G ) ≥ 2, then ξ c (G ) ≥ 4m = 4n > 3n + 1, and if r (G ) = 1, then G is

formed by adding an edge to the star S n , for which ξ c (G ) = (n − 1) ⋅1 + 2 ⋅ 2 + 2 ⋅ 2
+1⋅ 2 ⋅ (n − 3) = 3n + 1. This proves Corollary 2. For a bicyclic graph G with n ≥ 5 vertices, if

r (G ) ≥ 2, then ξ c (G ) ≥ 4m = 4(n + 1) > 3n + 5, and if r (G ) = 1, then G is formed by adding
two edges to the star S n , for which ξ c (G ) = (n − 1) ⋅1 + 2 ⋅ 2 ⋅ 2 + 3 ⋅ 2 + 1⋅ 2 ⋅ (n − 4) = 3n + 5 if
the added edges are adjacent, and ξ c (G ) = (n − 1) ⋅1 + 2 ⋅ 2 ⋅ 4 + 1⋅ 2 ⋅ (n − 5) = 3n + 5 if the added
edges are not adjacent. This proves Corollary 3.
For a connected graph G, let Du = DG (u ) =

∑

u∈V ( G )

∑

d (u , v | G ). Then D '(G ) =

v∈V ( G )

du Du is the degree distance of G [16,17], which is also a part of the Schultz molecular

topological index [18-20]. We give a relation between the eccentric connectivity index and
the degree distance.

Proposition 4. Let G be a connected graph with n ≥ 2 vertices. Then

ξ c (G ) ≥

1
D '(G )
n −1

with equality if and only if G = K n .

Proof.

Obviously, eu ≥

Du
with equality if and only if d (u, v | G ) is a constant for all
n −1

v ∈ V (G ) with v ≠ u. It follows that

ξ c (G ) ≥

∑

u∈V ( G )

Du
1
D '(G )
=
n −1 n −1

with equality if and only if d (u , v | G ) is a constant for all u , v ∈ V (G ) with u ≠ v, i.e.,
G = Kn .
Recall that the Wiener index of a connected graph G
W (G ) =

is defined as

1
∑ Du [21]. Let G be a connected graph with n ≥ 2 vertices and minimum
2 u∈V (G )

degree δ . By Proposition 4, it is easily seen that ξ c (G ) ≥

2δ
W (G ) with equality if and
n −1

only if G = K n .
The first Zagreb index of a graph G is defined as M 1 (G ) =

∑

u∈V ( G )

du2 [22-25]. Let

⎢n⎥
K n − ke be the graph formed by deleting k , where k = 1,… , ⎢ ⎥ , independent edges from
⎣2⎦
the complete graph K n . Let K n − 0e = K n . Obviously, K n − ke is actually a complete (n − k)partite graph with exactly n − 2k partite sets of cardinality one and k partite sets of
⎢n⎥
cardinality two, for k = 0,1,… , ⎢ ⎥ .
⎣2⎦

Proposition 5. Let G be a connected graph with n ≥ 3 vertices and m edges. Then

ξ c (G ) ≤ 2nm − M 1 (G )
⎢n⎥
with equality if and only if G = K n − ke, for k = 0,1,… , ⎢ ⎥ , or G = P4 .
⎣2⎦

Proof. Let d (u; i ) be the number of vertices that are of distance i from a vertex u in G,
i = 1, 2,… , eu . For u ∈ V (G ), it is easily seen that

eu

eu

i =2

i =2

n − 1 = du + ∑ d (u; i ) ≥ du + ∑1 = du + eu − 1,

and thus eu ≤ n − 1 − (du − 1) = n − du with equality if and only if eu = 1 (and then du = n − 1 )
or eu ≥ 2 with d (u; 2) =

= d (u; eu ) = 1. Then

ξ c (G ) =

u∈V ( G )

u∈V ( G )

d u (n − du ) = n

u∈V ( G )

du −

∑

u∈V ( G )

du2 = 2nm − M 1 (G ).

Suppose that equality holds in the above inequality. Then eu = n − du , and thus eu = 1
or eu ≥ 2 with d (u; 2) =

= d (u; eu ) = 1 for all u ∈ V (G ).

Suppose first that eu = 1 for some u ∈ V (G ). Then du = n − 1 and ev = 1 or 2 for all
v ≠ u. If ev = 1 for all v ≠ u , then G = K n . Suppose that ev = 2 for some v ∈ V (G ). Then

there exists a vertex w ∈ V (G ) such that d (v, w | G ) = 2. Since d (v; 2) = d ( w; 2) = 1, the
vertex w is unique for fixed v. Thus, d v = d w = n − 2, implying that G = K n − ke, for
⎢ n − 1⎥
.
k = 1,… , ⎢
⎣ 2 ⎥⎦

Now suppose that eu ≥ 2 for all u ∈ V (G ). Then d (u; 2) =

= d (u; eu ) = 1. If eu = 2

for all u ∈ V (G ), then du = n − 2 for all u ∈ V (G ), and since the sum of degrees n( n − 2) is
n
always even, n is even and thus G = K n − e. If eu ≥ 3 for some u ∈ V (G ), then D(G ) = 3
2

(otherwise, for a center z of a diametrical path, d ( z; 2) ≥ 2, a contradiction), and then it is
easily seen that G = P4 .
Conversely, it is easily checked that the upper bound for ξ c (G ) is attained for

G = K n − ke, for k = 0,1,… , ⎢ ⎥ , or G = P4 .

4. RESULTS FOR TREES

In this section, we study the eccentric connectivity index for trees in more detail. We
determine the trees of fixed diameter with the minimum eccentric connectivity index, and
then deduce the n-vertex trees with respectively the minimum, second-minimum, and thirdminimum eccentric connectivity indices for n ≥ 6. We also determine the trees of fixed

number of pendent vertices with the maximum eccentric connectivity index, and then deduce
the n-vertex trees with respectively the maximum, second-maximum, and third-maximum
eccentric connectivity indices for n ≥ 6.
Lemma 1. Let u be a vertex of a tree Q with at least two vertices. For integer a ≥ 1, let G1
be the tree obtained by attaching a star S a +1 at its center v to u of Q, G2 the tree obtained
by attaching a + 1 pendent vertices to u of Q (see Fig. 1). Then ξ c (G2 ) < ξ c (G1 ).

Proof. Denote by w a pendent neighbor of v in G1 and a pendent neighbor of u in G2

eG2 ( w) = eG1 (v) and

eG1 (u ) < eG1 ( w). Then

ξ c (G2 ) − ξ c (G1 ) =

and thus, ξ c (G2 ) < ξ c (G1 ). The result follows.
Let T(n, d ) be the set of n-vertex trees with diameter d , where 2 ≤ d ≤ n − 2. Let
T( n ,d ) be the set of n-vertex trees obtained from Pd +1 = v0 v1

vd by attaching n − d − 1 pendent

Suppose that d ≥ 3 and G is a tree in T(n, d ) with the minimum eccentric
connectivity index. Let P (G ) = v0 v1

vd be a diametrical path of G. By Lemma 1, all vertices

outside P(G ) are pendent vertices adjacent to vertices of P(G ). Suppose that there exists

double-stars (formed by adding an edge connecting the centers of two stars, each with at least
two vertices), and T( n ,4) contains a unique tree formed by attaching n − 5 pendent vertices to
the center of the path with five vertices. Then, we have
Proposition 7. Among the n-vertex trees with n ≥ 6, S n , n-vertex double-stars, and the tree
formed by attaching n − 5 pendent vertices to the center of the path with five vertices are
respectively the unique trees with the minimum, second-minimum, and third-minimum
eccentric connectivity indices, which are equal to 3(n − 1), 5n − 6, and 5n − 1, respectively.

Lemma 2.

Let G1 and G2 be the trees shown in Fig. 2, where vertices x and y are

connected by a path of length at least one (if the length is more than one, then vertices in this
path except x and y are of degree two), y has a unique neighbor in N , and dG1 ( x) ≥ 2. In
G1 , y has at least one neighbor in M , and all of such neighbors are switched to be
neighbors of x in G2 . If max{d ( y, u | G1 ) : u ∈ V ( M )} ≤ max{d ( y, u | G1 ) : u ∈ V ( N )} and N is
not a single vertex, then ξ c (G1 ) < ξ c (G2 ) .

Fig. 2. The trees in Lemma 2.

Proof.

Since

max{d ( y, u | G1 ) : u ∈ V ( M )} ≤ max{d ( y, u | G1 ) : u ∈ V ( N )},

we

have

eG2 (u ) ≥ eG1 (u ) for any u ∈ V (G1 ). Since N is a not single vertex, we have eG1 ( x) > eG1 ( y ).

Let s be the number of neighbors of

y

of G1 in M . Then dG1 ( y ) = s + 2,

dG2 ( x) = dG1 ( x) + s and s ≥ 1. We have

ξ c (G2 ) − ξ c (G1 ) =

∑

u∈V ( G1 )\{ x , y }

dG1 (u ) ⎡⎣ eG2 (u ) − eG1 (u ) ⎤⎦

+ dG2 ( x)eG2 ( x) − dG1 ( x)eG1 ( x) + dG2 ( y )eG2 ( y ) − dG1 ( y )eG1 ( y )

with equality if and only if G ∈ T ( n , p ) .

Proof. The case p = 2 is trivial. Suppose that 3 ≤ p ≤ n − 2 and G is a tree in T (n, p) with

the maximum eccentric connectivity index. There are some pendent paths (of length one or
more) in G as p ≥ 3.
Case 1. There is some pendent path with length at least two in G.

Let Q be a pendent path with length at least two in G. Let u1 be the neighbor of the
pendent vertex in Q and u2 the root in Q. Let G ′ be the graph obtained from G by deleting
the vertices in Q. If G ′ is not an empty graph, then making use of Lemma 2 to G1 = G by
setting x = u1 and y = u2 , we may get a tree in T (n, p ) with larger eccentric connectivity
index, a contradiction. Thus, G′ is an empty graph, i.e., G = T1n, p ∈ T (n , p ) .
Case 2. Every pendent path in G is a pendent edge.

In this case p ≥ 4. Let u be the neighbor of an end vertex and the neighbor of the
other end vertex of a diameter-achieving path of G. Then both u and v have at least two
pendent neighbors. Suppose that there exists a vertex on the path joining u and v with degree
more than two. Let w be such a vertex such that d (u, w | G ) is as small as possible. Making
use of Lemma 2 to G1 = G by setting x = u and y = w, we may get a tree in T (n, p ) with
larger eccentric connectivity index, a contradiction. Thus, either d (u , v | G ) = 1, or the vertices
in the path joining u and v are all of degree two, except u and v . In either case, G ∈ T ( n , p ) .
Combining Cases 1 and 2, we have G ∈ T ( n, p ) . Conversely, it is easily seen that

respectively.

For 2 ≤ p ≤ n − 3,

Proof.

T1n, p ∈ T ( n , p ) and T1n , p +1 ∈ T ( n , p +1) , by Lemma 1, we have

ξ c (T1n, p ) > ξ c (T1n , p +1 ). Note that T (n, 2) = T ( n ,2) = {Pn } and T ( n ,3) = {Tn,1}. Then, by
Proposition 8, Pn and Tn,1 are respectively the unique n-vertex trees with the maximum and
second-maximum eccentric connectivity indices.
Now suppose that G is an n-vertex tree different from Pn and Tn ,1. Let p be the
number of pendent vertices of G.
If p ≥ 4, then by the arguments as above, we have ξ c (G ) ≤ ξ c (T ( n ,4) ) with equality if
and only if G ∈ T ( n,4) .
Suppose that p = 3. Then G is a tree obtained by identifying three pendent vertices of
three paths. Denote by a, b and c respectively the lengths of the three paths. Assume that
⎢n − 4⎥
, it is easily
a ≥ b ≥ c. Suppose first that c = 1. Then G = Tn,i with i ≥ 2. For 2 ≤ i ≤ ⎢

= [ (n − 2 − i ) − (n − 1 − i) ] − (n − 2 − i ) + (n − 3 − i ) = −2 < 0,

and thus, ξ c (Tn , ⎣⎢( n − 2) / 2⎦⎥ ) <

< ξ c (Tn ,2 ). Now suppose that c ≥ 2. Let x1 be the common vertex

of the three paths, and x2 the neighbor of the pendent vertex of the path with length b.
Making use of Lemma 2 to G1 = G by setting y = x1 and x = x2 , we have ξ c (G ) < ξ c (Tn ,c )
≤ ξ c (Tn ,2 ). Hence, Tn ,2 is the unique tree with the second-maximum eccentric connectivity

index in T (n,3).

We are left to compare eccentric connectivity indices of Tn ,2 and graphs in T ( n ,4) .
Note that T1n ,4 = Tn ,2 − {v0 v1} + {v0 v2 } ∈ T ( n ,4) . By Lemma 1, we have ξ c (T1n ,4 ) < ξ c (Tn ,2 ). Thus,
Tn ,2 is the unique n-vertex tree with the third-maximum eccentric connectivity index.

5. CONCLUSION

In this paper, we deal with the eccentric connectivity index of a connected graph. We present
various lower and upper bounds for the eccentric connectivity index in terms of other graph
invariants including the number of vertices, the number of edges, the degree distance and the
first Zagreb index, determine the n-vertex trees of diameter d , 3 ≤ d ≤ n − 2, with the
minimum eccentric connectivity index, and the n-vertex trees of p pendent vertices,
3 ≤ p ≤ n − 2, with the maximum eccentric connectivity index. In addition, we determine the
n-vertex trees with the minimum, second-minimum and third-minimum eccentric connectivity

indices as well as with the maximum, second-maximum and third-maximum eccentric
connectivity indices for n ≥ 6.
A necessary condition for a molecular descriptor to be an acceptable measure of
branching is that within the set of all n-vertex trees, its values should be extremal for Pn and
Sn [e.g., 27]. Our result (in Propositions 7 and 9) shows that the eccentric connectivity index

satisfies this requirement.
Some topics for further research may be: To determine the n-vertex tree(s) of given
number of pendent vertices with the minimum eccentric connectivity index, the n-vertex
tree(s) of given maximum degree with the maximum eccentric connectivity index, and the n⎛n⎞
vertex connected graph(s) of m edges, n − 1 ≤ m < ⎜ ⎟ , with the maximum eccentric
⎝2⎠
connectivity index.
