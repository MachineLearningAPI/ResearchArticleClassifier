1. Introduction
The Minkowski problem concerns the existence, uniqueness, and stability of convex hypersurfaces whose Gauss curvature (possibly in a generalized sense) is prescribed as a function of the
outer unit normals. The Minkowski problem is one of the centerpieces of the classical Brunn–
Minkowski theory. The complete solution to the Minkowski problem (for arbitrary “data” —
with no smoothness assumptions) goes back exactly three-quarters of a century to the work of
Aleksandrov and Fenchel and Jessen (see Schneider [59] for references). Of course, when the
Minkowski “data” is discrete then the solution goes back to Minkowski’s work at the turn of the
19th into the 20th Century.
Almost a century after Minkowski’s original work, an Lp version of the Brunn–Minkowski
theory began to emerge, beginning largely with [33,34], and expanding rapidly thereafter (see,

e.g., [1–5,7–11,13,15–22,25–40,42–45,49,50,52–55,58,60–63,65–68]). The Lp Minkowski problem is also of central importance in this new Lp -Brunn–Minkowski theory.
For a given continuous function g : S n−1 → R (called the “data”), the regular Lp Minkowski
problem seeks solutions h : S n−1 → (0, ∞) to the partial differential equation
h1−p det(hij + hδij ) = g

on S n−1 ,

(1)

where (hij ) is the Hessian matrix of h with respect to an orthonormal frame on S n−1 . The case
p = 1 is classical with landmark contributions such as Cheng and Yau [6] and Pogorelov [56].
The general Lp Minkowski problem asks: Given a real p, what are the necessary and sufficient
conditions on a Borel measure μ on the unit sphere, S n−1 , such that there exists a convex body K
in Rn with support function hK and surface area measure SK (see Section 2 for definitions) so
that
1−p

hK

dSK = dμ.

The solutions to the general Lp Minkowski problem (2) may be viewed as weak solutions to
the regular Lp Minkowski problem (1). While regularity is a central focus in the fields of partial
differential equations and differential geometry, the existence and the uniqueness of weak solutions of the Minkowski problem are of paramount interest to those working in convex geometric
and functional analysis. This is because it is precisely these solutions that correspond to support
functions of polytopes or to Banach norms (which often have limited smoothness).
The even Lp Minkowski problem seeks solutions under the assumption that the data measure
μ is an even Borel measure on S n−1 (i.e. assumes the same values on antipodal Borel sets) or the
data function g is an even function (i.e. assumes the same values on antipodal points of S n−1 ).
The Lp Minkowski problem with even data is not only natural but of practical interest because
its solutions correspond to norms of Banach spaces.
In this paper the “Lp Minkowski problem” will always refer to the general Lp Minkowski
problem (2). The case p = 1 of the Lp Minkowski problem (2) is of course the classical
Minkowski problem. For p > 1, a solution to the even Lp Minkowski problem was given in
[33] under the assumption that p = n. In [41], it was shown that, for p = n, the Lp Minkowski
problem (2) has an equivalent volume-normalized formulation and a solution of the even volumenormalized Lp Minkowski problem was given for all p > 1. The regular even Lp Minkowski
problem was studied in [35].
In the plane (n = 2), the Lp Minkowski problem was treated by Stancu [61–63], Umanskiy
[65], Chen [5], and most recently by Jiang [24].
The Lp Minkowski problem (without the assumption that the data is even) was treated by
Guan and Lin [15] and later by Chou and Wang [7]. Hug et al. [23] gave an alternate approach to
some of the results of Chou and Wang [7].
The solution of the even Lp Minkowski problem was a critical ingredient that allowed the
authors of [40] to extend the affine Sobolev inequality [69] and obtain the Lp affine Sobolev
inequality and later enabled Cianchi et al. [8] to establish the affine Moser–Trudinger and the
affine Morrey–Sobolev inequalities.
Recent work of Haberl and Schuster [19,20], Haberl, Schuster, and Xiao [21], Ludwig and
Reitzner [32], and Ludwig [31], shows the need to take the next step in the evolution of the
Brunn–Minkowski theory towards an Orlicz Brunn–Minkowski theory. This is the third paper in

C. Haberl et al. / Advances in Mathematics 224 (2010) 2485–2510

2487

a series [46,47] that attempts to develop some of the elements of an Orlicz Brunn–Minkowski
theory.
Suppose ϕ : (0, ∞) → (0, ∞) is a fixed continuous function. The aim of this paper is to study
the even Lϕ Minkowski problem: If μ is an even finite Borel measure on S n−1 which is not
concentrated on a great subsphere of S n−1 , then does there exist an origin symmetric convex
body K in Rn such that
cϕ(hK ) dSK = dμ,
for some positive number c? We will show that under some mild assumptions on ϕ, the even Lϕ
Minkowski problem does have a solution. For example we shall establish:
Theorem. Suppose ϕ : (0, ∞) → (0, ∞) is a continuous decreasing function. If μ is an even
finite Borel measure on S n−1 which is not concentrated on a great subsphere of S n−1 , then there
exists an origin symmetric convex body K in Rn such that
cϕ(hK ) dSK = dμ,
1

where c is a power of the volume of K — specifically, c = V (K) 2n −1 .
When ϕ and the data μ are assumed to be sufficiently smooth, and under certain other restrictions, the existence of solutions to the Lϕ Minkowski problem was already demonstrated
by Chou and Wang [7]. For applications in analysis (such as in obtaining analytic inequalities
of the type presented in [69] and [40]) and for applications in geometry (such as in obtaining
affine isoperimetric inequalities), various Banach norms and convex bodies must be constructed.
These constructions amount to solving an Lϕ Minkowski problem — but usually with minimal
restrictions on ϕ and the measure μ. (Note that a polytopal solution of the Lϕ Minkowski problem corresponds to a measure μ whose support is a finite set.) In this paper we will establish the
existence of solutions to the Lϕ Minkowski problem with such minimal restrictions on ϕ and μ.
One interesting feature of our work is that it presents a new approach to the classical
Minkowski problem as well as the even Lp Minkowski problem for p > 0.
2. Preliminaries
For quick later reference we develop some notation and basic facts about convex bodies. Good
general references for the theory of convex bodies are provided by the books of Gardner [12],
Gruber [14], Schneider [59], and Thompson [64].
Our setting will be Euclidean n-space Rn where n 2. The standard inner product of the
vectors x, y ∈ Rn is denoted by x · y. We write S n−1 = {x ∈ Rn : x · x = 1} for the boundary of
the Euclidean unit ball B in Rn .
The set of continuous functions on the sphere S n−1 will be denoted by C(S n−1 ) and will
always be viewed as equipped with the max-norm metric:
f −g

∞

= max f (u) − g(u) ,
u∈S n−1

for f, g ∈ C(S n−1 ). The subspace of positive continuous functions will be denoted by C + (S n−1 )
and Ce+ (S n−1 ) will denote the subspace of C + (S n−1 ) consisting of only the even functions.

2488

Write V for n-dimensional Lebesgue measure and Hn−1 for (n − 1)-dimensional Hausdorff
measure. The letter μ will be used exclusively to denote a finite Borel measure on S n−1 . For
such a measure μ, we denote by |μ| its total mass, i.e. |μ| = μ(S n−1 ). The letter c (possibly
with subscripts or other distinguishing features) will be used exclusively to denote a positive real
number.
A convex body is a compact convex subset of Rn with non-empty interior. The set of convex
bodies in Rn containing the origin in their interiors is denoted by Kon . The set of convex bodies
in Rn that are symmetric about the origin will be denoted by Ken .
A compact, convex set K ⊂ Rn is uniquely determined by its support function hK : Rn → R,
where hK (x) = max{x · y: y ∈ K}, for each x ∈ Rn . For example, the support function of the
line segment v¯ joining the points ±v ∈ Rn is given by
hv¯ (x) = |x · v|,

x ∈ Rn .

We will need the trivial fact that for the support function of the dilate cK = {cx: x ∈ K} of a
compact, convex K we have
hcK = chK ,

c > 0.

(3)

Note that support functions are positively homogeneous of degree 1 and subadditive. It follows
immediately from the definition of support functions that for compact, convex K, L ⊂ Rn ,
K ⊆L

⇐⇒

hK

hL .

(4)

Consequently, the support function of a body K ∈ Kon is bounded from above and below by
positive reals.
The set Kon will be viewed as equipped with the Hausdorff metric and thus for a sequence {Ki }
of bodies in Kon and a body K ∈ Kon , we have limi→∞ Ki = K provided that
hKi − hK

∞

→ 0.

A boundary point x ∈ ∂K is said to have u ∈ S n−1 as an outer normal provided x · u = hK (u).
A boundary point is said to be singular if it has more than one unit normal vector. It is well known
(see, e.g., [59]) that the set of singular boundary points of a convex body has Hn−1 -measure equal
to 0.
For a convex body K and each Borel set ω ⊂ S n−1 , the inverse spherical image, τ (K, ω),
of K at ω is the set of all boundary points of K which have an outer unit normal belonging to
the set ω. Associated with each convex body K ∈ Kon is a Borel measure, SK , on S n−1 called the
Aleksandrov–Fenchel–Jessen surface area measure of K, defined by
SK (ω) = Hn−1 τ (K, ω) ,

(5)

for each Borel set ω ⊆ S n−1 . Observe that for the surface area measure of the dilate cK of K we
have
ScK = cn−1 SK ,

c > 0.

(6)

C. Haberl et al. / Advances in Mathematics 224 (2010) 2485–2510

2489

We will use the weak continuity of surface area measures; i.e., if {Ki } is a sequence of bodies
in Kon then
lim Ki = K ∈ Kon

⇒

i→∞

lim SKi = SK ,

i→∞

(7)

The mixed volume V1 (K, L) of the convex bodies K, L ∈ Kon may be defined by
V1 (K, L) =

hL dSK .

S n−1

The fact that
V (K) = V1 (K, K),
or equivalently,
V (K) =

1

hK dSK ,

(9)

S n−1

is of critical importance. The fundamental inequality for mixed volumes is Minkowski’s mixed
volume inequality: For K, L ∈ Kon ,
V1 (K, L)n

V (K)n−1 V (L)

(10)

with equality if and only if K and L are homothetic.
3. Aleksandrov bodies
A function h ∈ C + (S n−1 ) defines a family {Hu }u∈S n−1 of hyperplanes
Hu = x ∈ Rn : x · u = h(u) .
This family gives rise to concepts such as envelopes in classical differential geometry, generalized envelopes in convex geometric analysis (see, e.g., [51]), and hedgehogs (see, e.g., [48]).
We shall be interested in the intersection of the halfspaces that are associated to h by the
family {Hu }u∈S n−1 . This gives rise to the convex body
K=

x ∈ Rn : x · u

h(u) .

u∈S n−1

The body K is called the Aleksandrov body associated with h. Note that since h is both positive
and continuous its Aleksandrov body, K, must be an element of Kon . The Aleksandrov body
associated with h can alternatively be defined as the unique maximal element, with respect to set
inclusion, of the set
Q ∈ Kon : hQ

h .

2490

C. Haberl et al. / Advances in Mathematics 224 (2010) 2485–2510

For the Aleksandrov body K associated with h we now examine equality (in S n−1 ) in the inequality
hK

h

in some detail. Aleksandrov showed that each element of τ (K, ωh ), the inverse spherical image
of K of the set
ωh = u ∈ S n−1 : hK (u) < h(u) ,
must be a singular boundary point of K. Since the set of singular boundary points of a convex
body has Hn−1 -measure zero, and since by (5), we know that SK (ωh ) = Hn−1 (τ (K, ωh )), it
follows that SK (ωh ) = 0. Consequently, while hK h, in fact
hK = h,

a.e. with respect to SK .

(11)

We will make use of the following three basic properties of Aleksandrov bodies. First, if h is
the support function of a convex body K ∈ Kon , then K itself is the Aleksandrov body associated
with h. Second, as is easily shown, if h is an even function, then the Aleksandrov body associated
with h is origin symmetric. Third and critical, is Aleksandrov’s convergence lemma (see, e.g., [59,
Lemma 6.5.2]): If the functions hi ∈ C + (S n−1 ) have associated Aleksandrov bodies Ki ∈ Kon ,
then
hi → h ∈ C + S n−1

⇒

Ki → K,

where K is the Aleksandrov body associated with h.
The volume V (h) of a function h ∈ C + (S n−1 ) is defined as the volume of the Aleksandrov
body associated with h. Since the Aleksandrov body associated with the support function hK of
a convex body K ∈ Kon is the body K itself, we have
V (hK ) = V (K).

(12)

From Aleksandrov’s convergence lemma and the continuity of ordinary volume on Kon we see
that
V : C + S n−1 → R is continuous.
Let I ⊂ R be an interval containing 0 and suppose that ht (u) = h(t, u) : I × S n−1 → (0, ∞)
is continuous. For fixed t ∈ I , let
x ∈ Rn : x · u

Kt =

h(t, u)

u∈S n−1

be the Aleksandrov body associated with ht . The family of bodies {Kt }t∈I will be called the
family of Aleksandrov bodies associated with h. Obviously, from (11) we have
hKt
for each t ∈ I .

ht

and hKt = ht ,

a.e. with respect to SKt ,

Lemma 1. Let I ⊂ R be an interval containing 0 and some positive number and the function
h(t, u) : I × S n−1 → (0, ∞) be continuous and such that the convergence in
h+ (0, u) = lim

t→0+

h(t, u) − h(0, u)

Proof. The uniform convergence of (14) implies that ht → h0 , uniformly on S n−1 . Therefore,
the Aleksandrov convergence lemma (mentioned above) yields
lim Kt = K0 .

(15)

t→0+

By (7) we conclude that the SKt converge weakly to SK0 as t → 0+ . Since the measures SKt are
finite, converge weakly to SK0 and since the convergence in
lim

h(t, u) − h(0, u)
t

is uniform on S n−1 , we obtain

We shall require the following corollary of Lemma 1.
Corollary 1. Let I ⊂ R be an interval containing 0 in its interior and let the function
h(t, u) : I × S n−1 → (0, ∞) be continuous and such that the convergence in
h(t, u) − h(0, u)

t

h (0, u) = lim

is uniform on S n−1 . If {Kt }t∈I is the family of Aleksandrov bodies associated with h, then

To that end, define h(t,

family {K−t }t∈I of Aleksandrov bodies associated with h˜ we have K˜ −t = Kt and K˜ 0 = K0 .
Thus, by Lemma 1,

V (K˜ t ) − V (K˜ 0 )

h˜ (0, u) dSK0 (u).

Obviously, h˜ (0, u) = −h (0, u), which immediately implies (22).

✷

The following lemma is a slight variant of a standard result about differentiability under an
integral sign. For the sake of completeness, we include a proof.
Lemma 2. Let φ : (0, ∞) → (0, ∞) be continuously differentiable, I ⊂ R be an open interval,
and
h : I × S n−1 → (0, ∞),

∂t (t, u) exists for all (t, u) ∈ I × S

If ∂t is bounded and h is bounded from above and from below by positive numbers, then the
function H : I → (0, ∞) defined by

(φ ◦ h)(t, u) dμ(u),

H (t) =

for t ∈ I , is differentiable on I and
∂(φ ◦ h)
(t, u) dμ(u).

H (t) =

S n−1

Moreover, if ∂(φ ◦ h)/∂t is continuous with respect to t, then H is continuous.
Proof. Since φ , the derivative of φ, is assumed to be continuous and h is bounded from above
and from below by positive numbers, there exists a c1 ∈ (0, ∞) such that
φ ◦ h (t, u)

c1

for all (t, u) ∈ I × S n−1 . This, the chain rule, and the assumption that
there exists a c2 ∈ (0, ∞) such that

Let {ti } be a sequence such that limi→∞ ti = t ∈ I with ti = t for all i. Set
fi =

(φ ◦ h)(ti , ·) − (φ ◦ h)(t, ·)
.
ti − t

The mean value theorem shows that for each i and u ∈ S n−1 there exists a ti = ti (u) ∈ I such
that
fi (u) =

∂(φ ◦ h)
ti , u
∂t

c2 ,

where the last inequality follows from (24). Since the measure μ is assumed to be finite, we have
shown that all the |fi | are bounded from above by the same integrable function. The dominated
convergence theorem applied to the sequence {fi } gives the differentiability of H and (23).
The last assertion of the lemma is again an immediate consequence of (24) and the dominated
convergence theorem. ✷

4. Orlicz norms
Throughout this section, let φ : [0, ∞) → [0, ∞) be strictly increasing, continuously differentiable on (0, ∞) with positive derivative, and satisfy limt→∞ φ(t) = ∞. Note that under these
assumptions, φ has an inverse φ −1 : φ([0, ∞)) → [0, ∞) which is continuously differentiable
on φ((0, ∞)).
Let μ be a finite Borel measure on the sphere S n−1 . For a continuous f : S n−1 → [0, ∞), the
Orlicz norm f φ is defined by
f

φ

= inf λ > 0:

1
|μ|

(25)

S n−1

Observe that the Orlicz norm of a function depends not only on φ but also on μ although this
is not reflected in our notation. Moreover, since φ may not be convex, the Orlicz norm defined
above may not satisfy the triangle inequality. The usual Lp norm is obtained by taking φ(t) = t p .
The reader is referred to [57] for background on Orlicz norms.
Observe that for continuous f : S n−1 → [0, ∞),

In particular we have

Moreover, it follows immediately from the monotonicity of the function φ that for continuous
functions f, g : S n−1 → [0, ∞),

(28)

The following simple fact will prove useful.
Lemma 3. Suppose μ is a finite Borel measure on S n−1 and the function f : S n−1 → [0, ∞) is
continuous and such that μ({f = 0}) > 0. Then the Orlicz norm f φ of f is positive and

Proof. Define a function ψ : (0, ∞) → [0, ∞), for λ > 0, by

S n−1

Since φ is strictly increasing and μ({f = 0}) > 0, the function ψ is strictly decreasing. It therefore has an inverse ψ −1 : ψ((0, ∞)) → (0, ∞). The dominated convergence theorem and the
continuity of φ on (0, ∞), show that ψ is continuous, as well.

Since f is continuous on S n−1 , there exists a c ∈ (0, ∞) with f (u) < c for every u ∈ S n−1 . Thus,
the monotonicity of φ yields

Finally (30) and the strict monotonicity of ψ yield

This shows that f

The continuity of the Orlicz norm is contained in the following lemma.
Lemma 4. Suppose f ∈ C(S n−1 ) with μ({f = 0}) > 0 and {fi } is a sequence of non-negative
functions in C(S n−1 ). If
fi → f

in C S n−1 ,

then
fi

Proof. From the uniform convergence, it follows that there exists a real c > 0 such that fi (u)

we prove that every convergent subsequence converges to f φ . Denote an arbitrary convergent

To see that limi→∞ fi φ > 0, suppose the contrary; i.e., fi φ → 0. Then Lemma 3, the nonnegativity of φ, Fatou’s lemma, and the fact that limt→∞ φ(t) = ∞ would produce the desired

We will need the following basic fact.
Lemma 5. If μ is a finite Borel measure on the sphere S n−1 which is not concentrated on a great
subsphere of S n−1 , then there exists a real c > 0 such that hv¯ φ > c for every v ∈ S n−1 .
Proof. Note that since μ is not concentrated on a great subsphere of S n−1 , we have, for every
v ∈ S n−1 ,
μ {hv¯ > 0} = μ S n−1 \v ⊥ > 0,
where v ⊥ denotes the codimension 1 subspace orthogonal to v. Hence Lemma 3 shows that
hv¯ φ > 0 for every unit vector v. In order to establish the assertion of the lemma, it suffices to
show that the function v → hv¯ φ is continuous.
Suppose vi ∈ S n−1 and vi → v. That hv¯i → hv¯ , uniformly on S n−1 is easily seen. Thus hv¯i φ
converges to hv¯ φ by Lemma 4. This establishes the desired continuity of v → hv¯ φ . ✷

5. The even Orlicz Minkowski problem
The first of the two main results shows existence for the even Orlicz Minkowski problem
under some mild assumptions regarding ϕ.
Theorem 1. Suppose ϕ : (0, ∞) → (0, ∞) is a continuous decreasing function. If μ is an even
finite Borel measure on S n−1 which is not concentrated on a great subsphere of S n−1 , then for
each α ∈ (0, 1) there exists an origin symmetric convex body K in Rn such that
cϕ(hK ) dSK = dμ,
α

with c = V (K) n −1 .
Note that for ϕ ≡ 1, Theorem 1 provides a solution to the even Minkowski problem — by
appealing to (6).
Proof of Theorem 1. Define the function φ : [0, ∞) → [0, ∞) by
t

1
ds.
ϕ(s)

φ(t) =
0

Observe that since ϕ is decreasing and 0 < α < 1, it follows that for c > 0
lim φ(ct)/t α = ∞,

(34)

lim φ(t)/t α = 0.

(35)

t→∞

and
t→0+

Since ϕ is decreasing, the derivative of φ is increasing and therefore the function φ is convex.
Furthermore, for c > 0 let ψc : (0, ∞) → R be defined by

C. Haberl et al. / Advances in Mathematics 224 (2010) 2485–2510

ψc (t) =

α
n
|μ|φ(ct) α

V (B) n −
α
tα

From (34) we conclude that limt→∞ ψc (t) = −∞. In particular, for each c there exists a real
rc > 0 such that
⇒

t > rc

ψc (t) < 0.

(36)

Motivated by the work of Chou and Wang [7], we define the functional Φ : Ce+ (S n−1 ) → R
by
Φ(f ) =

α
n
V (f ) n −
α

φ ◦ f dμ,

S n−1

for f ∈ Ce+ (S n−1 ). Since, as seen in Section 3, the volume V : C + (S n−1 ) → R is continuous,
with respect to the max-norm metric, Φ is continuous as well.
Note that by (12), for every r > 0,
Φ(hrB ) =

α
n α
r V (B) n − φ(r)|μ| =
α

α
n
|μ|φ(r) α
V (B) n −
r .
α
rα

From this and (35) we see that Φ(hrB ) is positive for small positive r. Hence
there exists K ∈ Ken such that Φ(hK ) > 0.

(37)

We are searching for a function at which Φ attains a maximum. The search can be restricted
to support functions of origin symmetric convex bodies. To see this, recall from Section 3 that
the Aleksandrov body K associated with a given function h ∈ Ce+ (S n−1 ) is origin symmetric and
has a support function hK which satisfies 0 < hK h. Since φ is increasing and V (h) = V (hK )
by (12) we deduce Φ(h) Φ(hK ).
Next, we will show that the search for a function at which Φ attains a maximum can be further
restricted to support functions of origin symmetric convex bodies contained in some ball of fixed
radius. To this end, first note that the continuous function on S n−1 ,
v→

hv¯ dμ,

S n−1

is positive since μ is not concentrated on a great subsphere. Thus, there exists a c ∈ (0, ∞) such
that

S n−1

for every v ∈ S n−1 . Let K ∈ Ken and choose vK ∈ S n−1 such that for a suitable real rK > 0
the point rK vK is an element of K with maximal distance from the origin. Since K is origin

2500

C. Haberl et al. / Advances in Mathematics 224 (2010) 2485–2510

symmetric, the line segment with endpoints ±rK vK is contained in K. From (3) and (4) we
deduce rK hv¯K hK . The monotonicity of φ, Jensen’s inequality, and (38) therefore yield

From (36) we therefore conclude that there exists a real r = rc > 0 such that
rK > r

⇒

Φ(hK ) < 0.

(39)

It follows from (37) and (39) that in order to find a maximum of the functional Φ on Ce+ (S n−1 ),
it is sufficient to search among support functions of members of the set
F = K ∈ Ken : K ⊂ rB .
Let {Ki } be a maximizing sequence in F for Φ, i.e.
lim Φ(hKi ) = sup Φ(hK ): K ∈ F .

i→∞

Obviously, the sequence {Ki } is bounded. Blaschke’s selection theorem (see, e.g., [59]) guarantees the existence of a convergent subsequence, which we also denote by {Ki }, with
limi→∞ Ki = K0 . Since the Ki ∈ Ken , the body K0 is origin symmetric. Moreover, the continuity of volume, (12), and the positivity of limi→∞ Φ(hKi ) yield

Consequently, the body K0 has non-empty interior and thus K0 ∈ Ken . The continuity of Φ now

Suppose f ∈ Ce+ (S n−1 ) is arbitrary but fixed. For sufficiently small δ > 0 we can define a
function, h : (−δ, δ) × S n−1 → (0, ∞), which is bounded from above and below by positive
reals, by
ht (u) := h(t, u) = hK0 (u) + tf (u).
By Lemma 2 and Corollary 1, the function t → Φ ◦ ht is differentiable at 0. Since K0 is a
maximizer of the functional Φ and h0 = hK0 we have

In order to establish this theorem we first establish four lemmas.
First extend the definition of φ to [0, ∞) by
t

ϕ(s)

φ(t) =

and φ(0) = lim φ(t).
t→0+

The function φ is strictly increasing and continuously differentiable on (0, ∞), and φ > 0.
Thus φ has an inverse φ −1 : φ([0, ∞)) → [0, ∞) which is continuously differentiable on
φ((0, ∞)). Observe that limt→∞ φ(t) = ∞.
Suppose that f ∈ C + (S n−1 ) and K ∈ Kon . Recall that the function φ is strictly increasing.
There exists δ > 0 so that
φ(1) − tf (u) ∈ φ

,

for all (t, u) ∈ (−δ, δ) × S n−1 . Define the function h˜ : (−δ, δ) × S n−1 → (0, ∞), at (t, u), by
˜ u) =
h(t,

hK (u)
.
φ −1 (φ(1) − tf (u))

(43)

Clearly, h˜ is bounded from above and below by positive reals (dependent on f and K). From (27)
and (28) we therefore have that also h˜ t φ is bounded from above and below by positive reals.
The following lemma follows directly from the definitions.
Lemma 6. The function h˜ is continuous and the derivative
is given by

∂ h˜
∂t (t, u)

hK (u)f (u)(φ −1 ) (φ(1) − tf (u))
∂ h˜
(t, u) =
.
∂t
[φ −1 (φ(1) − tf (u))]2

(44)

Moreover, it is continuous and bounded from above and below by positive reals.
We now establish:
Lemma 7. The function t → V (h˜ t ) is differentiable at 0.
Proof. By Lemma 6, the function h˜ is continuous. So in order to apply Corollary 1 it remains to
show that the convergence in
h˜ t (u) − h˜ 0 (u)
t→0
t

(45)

is uniform on S n−1 . Let δ ∈ (0, δ). By the mean value theorem, for every t ∈ [−δ , δ ] we can
find a t ∈ [−t, t] such that

Since [−δ , δ ] × S n−1 is compact, Lemma 6 shows that the partial derivative ∂∂th (t, u) is uniformly continuous on [−δ , δ ] × S n−1 . Hence, the convergence in (45) is uniform on S n−1 . ✷
Also needed will be:
Lemma 8. The function t → h˜ t

φ

is differentiable on (−δ, δ) with bounded derivative.

˜ there exist c1 , c2 ∈ (0, ∞) such that
Proof. As previously mentioned (after the definition of h)
c1 < h˜ t (u) < c2 ,

for all (t, u) ∈ (−δ, δ) × S n−1 .

Define the function G : (−δ, δ) × (c1 , c2 ) → R at (t, λ) by
G(t, λ) =

Furthermore, for fixed λ ∈ (c1 , c2 ), define h1 : (−δ, δ) × S n−1 → (0, ∞) by
˜ u)/λ,
h1 (t, u) = h(t,
and, for fixed t ∈ (−δ, δ), define h2 : (c1 , c2 ) × S n−1 → (0, ∞) by
˜ u)/λ.
h2 (λ, u) = h(t,
Clearly, the functions h1 and h2 are bounded from above and below by positive reals. Moreover,
∂h2
1
by Lemma 6, the derivatives ∂h
∂t and ∂λ exist, are continuous, and bounded on their domains.
Thus, by applying Lemma 2 to h1 and h2 respectively, the partial derivatives ∂G/∂t, ∂G/∂λ
exist. Since ∂(φ ◦ h1 )/∂t and ∂(φ ◦ h2 )/∂λ are continuous by Lemma 6, another application of
Lemma 2 shows that ∂G/∂t and ∂G/∂λ are in fact continuous. Since by Lemma 2 interchanging
differentiation and integration are permitted, an elementary calculation shows that ∂G/∂t and
−∂G/∂λ are bounded from above and below by positive reals. In particular, ∂G/∂λ is always
nonzero.

Note that from the continuity of h,
˜h : [−δ , δ ] × S n−1 for arbitrary 0 < δ < δ. Thus the convergence in limε→0 h˜ t+ε = h˜ t is uniform
and hence, by Lemma 4, limε→0 h˜ t+ε φ = h˜ t φ . Hence xε → (t, h˜ t φ ) as ε → 0.
Since, as shown above, the partial derivatives of G are continuous and ∂G/∂λ is always
nonzero, we conclude from (46) that h˜ t φ is differentiable with

bounded, we therefore conclude that ∂ h˜ t /∂t is bounded as well. Lemma 2 yields the differentiability, at 0, of
φ ◦ h˜ t dμ,

t→

and together with (44), (49), and (50), the desired formula (48).

✷

We are now in a position to establish Theorem 2.
Proof of Theorem 2. For f ∈ Ce+ (S n−1 ), define the functional Φ : Ce+ (S n−1 ) → R by
Φ(f ) = f

1/n
.
φ /V (f )

Lemma 4, together with the fact that V : Ce+ (S n−1 ) → R is continuous, shows that Φ is continuous as well.
We are searching for a function at which Φ attains a minimum. As before, the search can
be restricted to support functions of origin symmetric convex bodies: Indeed, recall that the
Aleksandrov body K associated with a given function h ∈ Ce+ (S n−1 ) is origin symmetric and
has a support function hK which satisfies 0 < hK h. The fact that V (h) = V (hK ) together
with (28) shows that Φ(hK ) Φ(h).
Since Φ is positively homogeneous of degree 0, the search can be further restricted to support
functions of convex bodies of unit volume. Let c1 = Φ(hB ), where B is the dilate of B chosen
so that V (B ) = 1. It follows that in order to find a minimum of the functional Φ on Ce+ (S n−1 ),
it is sufficient to search among the support functions of the members of the set
F = K ∈ Ken : Φ(hK )

c1 and V (K) = 1 .

Let {Ki } be a minimizing sequence, of bodies in F , for the functional Φ, i.e.,
lim Φ(hKi ) = inf Φ(hK ): K ∈ F .

i→∞

We now show that the sequence {Ki } is bounded. For each i, let vi ∈ S n−1 be chosen such that
for suitable ri > 0 the points ri vi are elements of Ki with maximal distance from the origin. Since
each Ki is origin symmetric, the segments with endpoints ±ri vi are contained in Ki . From (3)
and (4) we deduce ri hv¯i hKi . Hence (26), (28), and the fact that the Ki belong to F imply
ri hv¯i

By Lemma 5, there exists a c2 ∈ (0, ∞) such that

for all i. Combining (51) and (52) we see that the ri are bounded from above and hence the
sequence {Ki } is bounded.

2506

C. Haberl et al. / Advances in Mathematics 224 (2010) 2485–2510

Now Blaschke’s selection theorem guarantees the existence of a convergent subsequence of
{Ki }, which we also denote by {Ki }, with limi→∞ Ki = K0 . Clearly, the body K0 is again an
origin symmetric compact, convex set. Since obviously V (K0 ) = 1, we see that K0 ∈ Ken . The
continuity of Φ now implies that K0 ∈ F and thus that
Φ(hK0 )

h(t,

hK0 (u)
.
φ −1 (φ(1) − tf (u))

Lemma 9 shows that the function t → Φ ◦ h˜ t is differentiable at 0. Since hK0 is a minimizer of
the functional Φ and h˜ 0 = hK0 we have

We first prove (i). Take ϕ(t) = t 1−p . From (41) we have (54) and from (42) that hK satisfies

We now show that a dilation of K gives the desired constant. By using (9), integration in (41)
gives

From (57) and (58) it follows that 1/c = nV (K)/|μ|. To complete the proof, let K = λK, where
