Abstract
Whether or not classical solutions of the 2D incompressible MHD equations without full dissipation and
magnetic diffusion can develop finite-time singularities is a difficult issue. A major result of this paper
establishes the global regularity of classical solutions for the MHD equations with mixed partial dissipation
and magnetic diffusion. In addition, the global existence, conditional regularity and uniqueness of a weak
solution is obtained for the 2D MHD equations with only magnetic diffusion.

1. Introduction
This paper concerns itself with the fundamental issue of whether classical solutions of the 2D
incompressible MHD equations can develop finite-time singularities. The 2D MHD equations
under consideration assume the form
ut + u · ∇u = −∇p + ν1 uxx + ν2 uyy + b · ∇b,

where (x, y) ∈ R2 , t
0, u = (u1 (x, y, t), u2 (x, y, t)) denotes the 2D velocity field, p =
p(x, y, t) denotes the pressure, b = (b1 (x, y, t), b2 (x, y, t)) denotes the magnetic field, and ν1 ,
ν2 , η1 and η2 are nonnegative real parameters.
When ν1 > 0, ν2 > 0, η1 > 0 and η2 > 0, (1)–(4) has a unique global classical solution for
every initial data (u0 , b0 ) ∈ H m with m 2 (see e.g. [4,9]). However, if any one of these parameters is zero, the global regularity issue has not been settled. This paper establishes the global
regularity of classical solutions of (1)–(4) with either ν1 = 0, ν2 = ν > 0, η1 = η > 0 and η2 = 0
or ν1 = ν > 0, ν2 = 0, η1 = 0 and η2 = η > 0. More precisely, we have the following theorem.
Theorem 1. Consider the 2D MHD equations (1)–(4) with ν1 = 0, ν2 = ν > 0, η1 = η > 0 and
η2 = 0. Assume u0 ∈ H 2 (R2 ) and b0 ∈ H 2 (R2 ) with ∇ · u0 = 0 and ∇ · b0 = 0. Then (1)–(4) with
the initial data (u0 , b0 ) has a unique global classical solution (u, b). In addition, (u, b) satisfies
(u, b) ∈ L∞ [0, ∞); H 2 ,

ωy ∈ L2 [0, ∞); H 1 ,

jx ∈ L2 [0, ∞); H 1 ,

(5)

where ω = ∇ × u and j = ∇ × b represent the vorticity and the current density, respectively.
A similar global regularity result can also be stated for (1)–(4) with ν1 = ν > 0, ν2 = 0, η1 = 0
and η2 = η > 0.
Attention is also paid to the 2D MHD equations without dissipation but with magnetic diffusion, namely (1)–(4) with ν1 = ν2 = 0 but with η1 = η2 = η > 0. In this case, we obtain the
following global a priori bound for ω = ∇ × u and j = ∇ × b,

for t

where C(η) is a constant depending on η only. One consequence of this global bound is the
existence of a global H 1 -weak solution. It is not clear if such weak solutions are unique or can
be improved to global classical solutions. However, if we know the velocity field u of a solution
obeys
T

(6)

then this solution actually becomes a classical solution on [0, T ] and two weak solutions with
one of their velocities satisfying this bound must coincide on [0, T ]. We remark that (6) is weaker
T
than the standard condition 0 ∇u(t) ∞ dt < ∞ and, as some preliminary evidence shows, is
more likely to be proven true for (1)–(4) with η1 = η2 = η > 0.
This work is partially motivated by the recent progress made by Chae [2], Hou and Li [7] and
Danchin and Paicu [3] on the 2D Boussinesq equations,

C. Cao, J. Wu / Advances in Mathematics 226 (2011) 1803–1822

1805

ut + u · ∇u = −∇p + ν u + θ e2 ,

(7)

∇ · u = 0,

(8)

θt + u · ∇θ = η θ,

(9)

where the 2D vector u represents the velocity field, the scalar θ the temperature, and e2 = (0, 1).
Chae [2], and Hou and Li [7] established the global regularity of (7)–(8) with either dissipation
or thermal diffusion. Further improvement was recently made by Hmidi, Keraani and Rousset,
1
who reduced the Laplacian − to (− ) 2 [5,6]. Danchin and Paicu [3] constructed global solutions of (7)–(8) with either η = 0 and ν u replaced by νuxx or ν = 0 and η θ by ηθxx . We
remark that the global regularity issue for the 2D MHD equations (1)–(4) is more sophisticated.
The equations of u and b in (1)–(4) are both nonlinearly coupled vectors equations and the approaches in [2,3] and [7] do not appear to apply. In fact, it is not clear if (1)–(4) with η1 = η2 = 0
or (1)–(4) with ν2 = η2 = 0 has global classical solutions.
The rest of this paper is divided into two sections. The second section is devoted to the global
regularity of (1)–(4) with either ν1 = 0, ν2 = ν > 0, η1 = η > 0 and η2 = 0 or ν1 = ν > 0, ν2 = 0,
η1 = 0 and η2 = η > 0. The third section handles (1)–(4) with ν1 = ν2 = 0 and η1 = η2 = η > 0.
Throughout these sections the Lp -norm of a function f is denoted by f p , the H s -norm by
f H s and the norm in the Sobolev space W s,p by f W s,p .
2. Mixed partial dissipation and magnetic diffusion
This section proves Theorem 1 as well as a parallel result for the case when ν1 = ν > 0,
ν2 = 0, η1 = 0 and η2 = η > 0. The proof of Theorem 1 is achieved through two stages. The first
stage establishes a global bound for ω(t) 2 and j (t) 2 while the second obtains a bound for
∇ω(t) 2 and ∇j (t) 2 . The following elementary lemma will play an important role.

jt + u · ∇j = ηjxx + b · ∇ω + 2∂x b1 (∂x u2 + ∂y u1 ) − 2∂x u1 (∂x b2 + ∂y b1 ),

2.4. Proof of Theorem 1
This subsection presents the proof of Theorem 1.
Proof of Theorem 1. With the a priori bounds of Propositions 2 and 3 at our disposal, the
proof of this theorem can be achieved through a parabolic regularization process. Let > 0 be a
small parameter and consider a family of solutions (u , b ) satisfying the regularized system of
equations
∂t u + u · ∇u = −∇p + ν∂yy u + b · ∇b +
∂t b + u · ∇b = η∂xx b + b · ∇u +

b ,

u ,

(19)
(20)

∇ · u = 0,

(21)

∇ · b = 0,

(22)

u (x, 0) = ψ ∗ u0 ,

b (x, 0) = ψ ∗ b0 ,

(23)

C. Cao, J. Wu / Advances in Mathematics 226 (2011) 1803–1822

where ψ (x) =

−2 ψ(x/

1813

) with ψ satisfying
ψ ∈ C0∞ R2

0,

ψ

and

ψ

1

= 1.

Since u (x, 0) and b (x, 0) are smooth, the standard theory on the 2D viscous MHD equations
(see e.g. [9]) guarantees that (19)–(23) has a unique global smooth solution (u , b ). It is easy to
see that (u , b ) obeys the a priori bounds in Propositions 2 and 3 uniformly in . The solution
(u, b) of (1)–(4) is then obtained as a limit of (u , b ) and obeys the bounds in Propositions 2
and 3.
The uniqueness of the solutions follows from the elementary inequalities (see Lemma 14
of [3])

2.5. (1)–(4) with ν1 = ν > 0, ν2 = 0, η1 = 0 and η2 = η > 0
A global regularity result similar to Theorem 1 can be established for the 2D MHD equations
(1)–(4) with ν1 = ν > 0, ν2 = 0, η1 = 0 and η2 = η > 0.
Theorem 4. Consider the 2D MHD equations (1)–(4) with ν1 = ν > 0, ν2 = 0, η1 = 0 and
η2 = η > 0. Assume u0 ∈ H 2 (R2 ) and b0 ∈ H 2 (R2 ) with ∇ · u0 = 0 and ∇ · b0 = 0. Then (1)–(4)
has a unique global classical solution (u, b). In addition, (u, b) satisfies
(u, b) ∈ L∞ [0, ∞); H 2 ,

ωx ∈ L2 [0, ∞); H 1 ,

jy ∈ L2 [0, ∞); H 1 ,

(24)

where ω = ∇ × u and j = ∇ × b represent the vorticity and the current density, respectively.
Proof. Although this theorem can be proven in a similar fashion as that of Theorem 1, we provide
an alternative proof. The idea is to convert (1)–(4) with ν1 = ν > 0, ν2 = 0, η1 = 0 and η2 = η > 0
into a form dealt with by Theorem 1. Assume that (u, b) solves (1)–(4) with ν1 = ν > 0, ν2 = 0,
η1 = 0 and η2 = η > 0. Set
U1 (x, y, t) = u2 (y, x, t),

U2 (x, y, t) = u1 (y, x, t),

B1 (x, y, t) = b2 (y, x, t),

P (x, y, t) = p(y, x, t),

B2 (x, y, t) = b1 (y, x, t).

1814

C. Cao, J. Wu / Advances in Mathematics 226 (2011) 1803–1822

Then U = (U1 , U2 ), P and B = (B1 , B2 ) satisfy
Ut + U · ∇U = −∇P + νUyy + B · ∇B,

(25)

Bt + U · ∇B = ηBxx + B · ∇U,

(26)

∇ · U = 0,

(27)

∇ · B = 0.

(28)

The global regularity of (25)–(28) guaranteed by Theorem 1 allows us to obtain the global regularity for (1)–(4) with ν1 = ν > 0, ν2 = 0, η1 = 0 and η2 = η > 0. This completes the proof of
Theorem 4. ✷
3. The MHD with magnetic diffusion
This section focuses on (1)–(4) with ν1 = ν2 = 0 and η1 = η2 = η > 0. Two major results are
established. The first is the global existence of a weak solution and the second assesses the global
regularity and uniqueness of the weak solution under a suitable condition.
Theorem 5. Consider (1)–(4) with ν1 = ν2 = 0 and η1 = η2 = η > 0. Assume that (u0 , b0 ) ∈ H 1
with ∇ · u0 = 0 and ∇ · b0 = 0. Then (1)–(4) has a global weak solution (u, b) satisfying
b ∈ C [0, ∞); H 1 ∩ L2 [0, ∞); H 2 .

u ∈ C [0, ∞); H 1 ,

(29)

The proof of this result relies on a global a priori bound for ω = ∇ × u and j = ∇ × b.
Theorem 6. Assume the initial data (u0 , b0 ) ∈ H 3 , ∇ · u0 = 0 and ∇ · b0 = 0. Let (u, b) be the
corresponding solution of (1)–(4) with ν1 = ν2 = 0 and η1 = η2 = η > 0. If, for some T > 0,
T

then (u, b) is regular on [0, T ], namely
(u, b) ∈ C [0, T ]; H 3 .
˜ in the regularity class (29) must be identical on
In addition, two weak solutions (u, b) and (u,
˜ b)
the time interval [0, T ] if u satisfies (30).
The rest of this section is divided into four subsections. The first subsection presents a global a
priori bound for u H 1 and b H 1 and the second proves Theorem 5. The third subsection establishes a logarithmic Sobolev inequality, which serves as a preparation for the proof of Theorem 6.
The last subsection proves Theorem 6.

3.2. Proof of Theorem 5
Let > 0 be a small parameter and consider the regularized system of equations
∂t u + u · ∇u = −∇p +

u + b · ∇b ,

∂t b + u · ∇b = η b + b · ∇u ,
∇ · u = 0,
∇ · b = 0.
This system of equations admits a unique global solution (u , b ) that satisfies the global a
priori bound stated in Proposition 7 uniformly in terms of . By going through a standard limit
process, we conclude that (u , b ) converge to a weak solution of (1)–(4) with ν1 = ν2 = 0 and
η1 = η2 = η. This completes the proof of Theorem 5.
3.3. A logarithmic inequality
This subsection presents a logarithmic Sobolev inequality, which plays an important role in
the proof of Theorem 6. A similar inequality was previously obtained by P. Zhang [11] and
by Danchin and Paicu [3] and their proofs involve tools from Fourier analysis such as the
Littlewood–Paley decomposition. The proof presented here is different and remains valid for
a general domain other than the whole plane.

L1 = − D β , u · ∇ u, D β u ,

L2 =

D β , b · ∇ b, D β u ,

L3 = − D β , u · ∇ b, D β b ,

L4 =

D β , b · ∇ b, D β b .

To bound L1 , L2 , L3 and L4 , we recall the commutator estimate (see [8, p. 334])

Applying Lemma 8 with a = 1 to bound ∇u ∞ , we obtain the regularity part of Theorem 6.
To prove the uniqueness, we consider the difference
˜ − (u, b),
(W, B) = (u,
˜ b)
which satisfies the equations
Wt + u˜ · ∇W + W · ∇u = −∇P + b˜ · ∇B + B · ∇b,

(38)

Bt + u˜ · ∇B + W · ∇b = η B + b˜ · ∇W + B · ∇u,

(39)

where P is the difference between the corresponding pressures. Adding the inner products of
(38) with W and of (39) with B and integrating by parts, we obtain
