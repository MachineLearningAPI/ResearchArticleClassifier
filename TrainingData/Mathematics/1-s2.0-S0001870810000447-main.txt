Abstract
We consider nonlinear elliptic problems involving a nonlocal operator: the square root of the Laplacian in
a bounded domain with zero Dirichlet boundary conditions. For positive solutions to problems with power
nonlinearities, we establish existence and regularity results, as well as a priori estimates of Gidas–Spruck
type. In addition, among other results, we prove a symmetry theorem of Gidas–Ni–Nirenberg type.

where Ω is a smooth bounded domain of Rn and A1/2 stands for the square root of the Laplacian
operator − in Ω with zero Dirichlet boundary values on ∂Ω.
To define A1/2 , let {λk , ϕk }∞
k=1 be the eigenvalues and corresponding eigenfunctions of the
Laplacian operator − in Ω with zero Dirichlet boundary values on ∂Ω,
− ϕk = λk ϕk
ϕk = 0

The fractions of the Laplacian, such as the previous square root A1/2 , are the infinitesimal
generators of Lévy stable diffusion processes and appear in anomalous diffusions in plasmas,
flames propagation and chemical reactions in liquids, population dynamics, geophysical fluid
dynamics, and American options in finance.
Essential to the results in this paper is to realize the nonlocal operator A1/2 in the following
local manner. Given a function u defined in Ω, we consider its harmonic extension v in the cylinder C := Ω × (0, ∞), with v vanishing on the lateral boundary ∂L C := ∂Ω × [0, ∞). Then, A1/2
∂v
is given by the Dirichlet to Neumann map on Ω, u → ∂ν
|Ω×{0} , of such harmonic extension
in the cylinder. In this way, we transform problem (1.1) to a local problem in one more dimension. By studying this problem with classical local techniques, we establish existence of positive
solutions for problems with subcritical power nonlinearities, regularity and an L∞ -estimate of
Brezis–Kato type for weak solutions, a priori estimates of Gidas–Spruck type, and a nonlinear
Liouville type result for the square root of the Laplacian in the half-space. We also obtain a
symmetry theorem of Gidas–Ni–Nirenberg type.
The analogue problem to (1.1) for the Laplacian has been investigated widely in the last
decades. This is the problem

see [24] and references therein. Considering the minimization problem min{ u

u Lp+1 (Ω) = 1}, one obtains a positive solution of (1.3) in the case f (u) =
1<
since the Sobolev embedding is compact. Ambrosetti and Rabinowitz [1] introduced the mountain pass theorem to study problem (1.3) for more general subcritical nonlinearities. Instead, for
n+2
f (u) = u n−2 , Pohozaev identity leads to nonexistence to (1.3) if Ω is star-shaped. In contrast,
Brezis and Nirenberg [4] showed that the nonexistence of solution may be reverted by adding a
small linear perturbation to the critical power nonlinearity.
For the square root A1/2 of the Laplacian, we derive the following result on existence of
positive solutions to problem (1.1).

Theorem 1.1. Let n 1 be an integer and 2 = n−1
when n 2. Suppose that Ω is a smooth
n
p
2, or that
bounded domain in R and f (u) = u . Assume that 1 < p < 2 − 1 = n+1
n−1 if n
1 < p < ∞ if n = 1.
Then, problem (1.1) admits at least one solution. This solution (as well as every weak solution)
belongs to C 2,α (Ω) for some 0 < α < 1.

As mentioned before, we realize problem (1.1) through a local problem in one more dimension
by a Dirichlet to Neumann map. This provides a variational structure to the problem, and we
study its corresponding minimization problem. Here the Sobolev trace embedding comes into
2n
play, and its critical exponent 2 = n−1
, n 2, is the power appearing in Theorem 1.1. We
call p critical (respectively, subcritical or supercritical) when p = 2 − 1 = n+1
n−1 (respectively,
p < 2 − 1 or p > 2 − 1). In the subcritical case of Theorem 1.1, the compactness of the Sobolev
trace embedding in bounded domains leads to the existence of solution. Its regularity will be
consequence of further results presented later in this introduction.
Remark 1.2. In [26] the second author J. Tan establishes the nonexistence of classical solutions to
(1.1) with f (u) = up in star-shaped domains for the critical and supercritical cases. In addition,
an existence result of Brezis–Nirenberg type [4] for f (u) = up + μu, μ > 0, is also established.
Gidas and Spruck [14] established a priori estimates for positive solutions of problem (1.3)
when f (u) = up and p < n+2
n−2 . Its proof involves the method of blow-up combined with two
important ingredients: nonlinear Liouville type results in all space and in a half-space. The proofs
of such Liouville theorems are based on the Kelvin transform and the moving planes method or
the moving spheres method. Here we establish an analogue: the following a priori estimates of
Gidas–Spruck type for solutions of problem (1.1).

Theorem 1.3. Let n 2 and 2 = n−1
. Assume that Ω ⊂ Rn is a smooth bounded domain and
f (u) = up , 1 < p < 2 − 1 = n+1
n−1 .
Then, there exists a constant C(p, Ω), which depends only on p and Ω, such that every weak
solution of (1.1) satisfies

u

L∞ (Ω)

C(p, Ω).

To prove this result, we combine the blow-up method and two useful ingredients: a nonlinear
Liouville theorem for the square root of the Laplacian in all of Rn , and a similar one in the halfspace Rn+ with zero Dirichlet boundary values on ∂Rn+ . The first one in the whole space was
proved by Ou [22] using the moving planes method and by Y.Y. Li, M. Zhu and L. Zhang [18,17]
using the moving spheres method. Its statement is the following.

As we will see later, here (− )1/2 is the usual half-Laplacian in all of Rn , and problem (1.4)
n+1

is equivalent to problem v = 0 and v > 0 in Rn+1

ouville theorem for the square root of the Laplacian in R+ = {x ∈ R | xn > 0} was not available
and we establish it in this paper for bounded solutions.
Theorem 1.5. Let n

In an equivalent way, let

If n

The proof of this result combines the Kelvin transform, the moving planes method, and a
Hamiltonian identity for the half-Laplacian found by Cabré and Solà-Morales [5]. The result of
Theorem 1.5 is still open without the assumption of boundedness of the solution.
Gidas, Ni, and Nirenberg [13] established symmetry properties for solutions to problem (1.3)
when f is Lipschitz continuous and Ω has certain symmetries. The proof of these symmetry
results uses the maximum principle and the moving planes method. The moving planes method
was introduced by Alexandroff to study a geometric problem, while in the framework of problem
(1.3) was first used by Serrin. In the improved version of Berestycki and Nirenberg [3], it replaces
the use of Hopf’s lemma by a maximum principle in domains of small measure.
Here we proceed in a similar manner and obtain the following symmetry result of Gidas–Ni–
Nirenberg type for (1.1).
Theorem 1.6. Assume that Ω is a bounded smooth domain of Rn which is convex in the x1
direction and symmetric with respect to the hyperplane {x1 = 0}. Let f be Lipschitz continuous
and u be a C 2 (Ω) solution of (1.1).
Then, u is symmetric with respect to x1 , i.e., u(−x1 , x ) = u(x1 , x ) for all (x1 , x ) ∈ Ω. In

In particular, if Ω = BR (0) is a ball, then u is radially symmetric, u = u(|x|) = u(r) for
r = |x|, and it is decreasing, i.e., ur < 0 for 0 < r < R.
We prove this symmetry result by using the moving planes method combined with the following maximum principle for the square root A1/2 of the Laplacian in domains of small measure
(see Proposition 4.4 for a more general statement in nonsmooth domains).
Proposition 1.7. Assume that u ∈ C 2 (Ω) satisfies
A1/2 u + c(x)u
u=0

0 in Ω,
on ∂Ω,

where Ω is a smooth bounded domain in Rn and c ∈ L∞ (Ω). Then, there exists δ > 0 depending
only on n and c− L∞ (Ω) , such that if |Ω ∩ {u < 0}| δ then u 0 in Ω.
The above maximum principle in “small” domains replaces the use of Hopf’s lemma to prove
symmetry results for A1/2 in Lipschitz domains. We point out that Chipot, Chlebík, Fila, and
Shafrir [9] studied the related problem:

where f, g ∈ C 1 (R) and ν is the unit outer normal. They proved existence, nonexistence, and
axial symmetry results for solutions of (1.7). Following one of their proofs, we establish Hopf’s
lemma for A1/2 , Lemma 4.3 below. Finally, let us mention that singular solutions and extremal
solutions of similar problems to (1.7) have been considered by Davila, Dupaigne, and Montenegro [10,11].
As we mentioned, crucial to our results is that A1/2 is a nonlocal operator in Ω but which can
be realized through a local problem in Ω × (0, ∞). To explain this, let us start with the square
root of the Laplacian (or half-Laplacian) in Rn . Let u be a bounded continuous function in all
n
of Rn . There is a unique harmonic extension v of u in the half-space Rn+1
+ = R × (0, ∞). That
is,
n
v = 0 in Rn+1
+ = (x, y) ∈ R × (0, ∞) ,

v=u

on Rn = ∂Rn+1
+ .

Consider the operator T : u → −∂y v(·, 0). Since ∂y v is still a harmonic function, if we apply the
operator T twice, we obtain
(T ◦ T )u = ∂yy v|y=0 = −

x v|y=0

= − u in Rn .

Thus, we see that the operator T mapping the Dirichlet data u to the Neumann data −∂y v(·, 0)
is actually a square root of the Laplacian. Indeed it coincides with the usual half-Laplacian,
see [16].

Here we introduce a new analogue extension problem in a cylinder C := Ω × (0, ∞) in one
more dimension to realize (1.1) by a local problem in C. More precisely, we look for a function v
with v(·, 0) = u in Rn satisfying the following mixed boundary value problem in a half-cylinder:

in C,

where ν is the unit outer normal to C at Ω × {0}. If v satisfies (1.8), then the trace u on Ω × {0}
of v is a solution of problem (1.1). Indeed, since ∂y v is harmonic and also vanishes on the lateral
boundary ∂Ω × [0, ∞), we see as before that the Dirichlet to Neumann map u → −∂y v(·, 0) is
the unique positive square root A1/2 of the Dirichlet Laplacian in Ω.
The generators of Lévy symmetric stable diffusion processes are the fractional powers of the
Laplacian (− )s in all of Rn , 0 < s < 1. Fractional Laplacians attract nowadays much interest
in physics, biology, finance, as well as in mathematical nonlinear analysis (see [2]). One of the
few nonlinear results which is not recent is due to Sugitani [25], who proved blow up results for
solutions of heat equations ∂t u + (− )s u = f (u) in Rn , for all 0 < s < 1. It is important to note
that the fundamental solution of the fractional heat equation has power decay (or heavy) tails, in
contrast with the exponential decay in case of the classical heat equation. Lévy processes have
also been applied to model American options [2]. As recent nonlinear works for fractional diffusions, let us mention the following. Caffarelli and Silvestre [7] have given a new local realization
of the fractional Laplacian (− )s , for all 0 < s < 1, through the Dirichlet–Neumann map of an
appropriate degenerate elliptic operator. The regularity of the obstacle problem for the fractional
powers of the Laplacian operator was proved by Silvestre [23]. The optimal regularity for such
Signorini problem was improved in [6]. Moreover, the operator (− )s plays an important role
in the study of the quasi-geostrophic equations in geophysical fluid dynamics; see the important
recent paper [8] by Caffarelli and Vasseur. Cabré and Solà-Morales [5] studied layer solutions
(solutions which are monotone with respect to one variable) of (− )1/2 u = f (u) in Rn , where
f is of balanced bistable type.
To prove Theorem 1.1, in view of (1.8) being a local realization of (1.1), we consider the
Sobolev space

(C) = v ∈ H 1 (C) v = 0 a.e. on ∂L C = ∂Ω × [0, ∞) ,
H0,L

equipped with the norm v = ( C |∇v|2 dx dy)1/2 . Since problem (1.8) has variational structure,
we consider its corresponding minimization problem

We will prove that, for subcritical powers, there is a minimizer for this problem. Its trace on
Ω × {0} will provide with a weak solution of (1.1).
Thus, it is important to characterize the space V0 (Ω) of all traces on Ω × {0} of functions in
1 (C). This is stated in the following result—which corresponds to Proposition 2.1 of the next
H0,L
section.

precisely, we will have that the inverse B1/2 = A−1
1/2 —which maps V0 (Ω) into itself, and also
L2 (Ω) into itself—is the unique square root of the inverse Laplacian (− )−1 in Ω with zero
Dirichlet boundary values on ∂Ω; see the next section for details.
To establish the regularity of weak solutions to (1.1) obtained by the previous minimization
technique, we establish the following results of Calderón–Zygmund and of Schauder type for the
linear problem

Theorem 1.9. Let u ∈ V0 (Ω) be a weak solution of (1.10), where g ∈ V0∗ (Ω) and Ω is a C 2,α
bounded domain in Rn , for some 0 < α < 1.
If g ∈ L2 (Ω), then u ∈ H01 (Ω).
If g ∈ H01 (Ω), then u ∈ H 2 (Ω) ∩ H01 (Ω).
If g ∈ L∞ (Ω), then u ∈ C α (Ω).
If g ∈ C α (Ω) and g|∂Ω ≡ 0, then u ∈ C 1,α (Ω).
If g ∈ C 1,α (Ω) and g|∂Ω ≡ 0, then u ∈ C 2,α (Ω).
In this paper we will give full—and rather simple—proofs of these regularity results, specially
since we could only find references for some of them and, besides, in close statements to ours but
not precisely ours. Our proof of Theorem 1.9 uses the extension problem in Ω × (0, ∞) related
to (1.10), and transforms it to a problem with zero Dirichlet boundary in Ω × {0} by using
an auxiliary function introduced in [5]. Then, by making certain reflections and using classical
interior regularity theory for the Laplacian, we prove Hölder regularity for u and its derivatives.
To apply the previous Hölder regularity linear results to our nonlinear problem (1.1), we first
need to prove that g := f (u) is bounded, i.e., u is bounded. We will see that boundedness of weak
solutions holds for subcritical and critical nonlinearities; we establish this result in Section 5. We
will follow the Brezis–Kato approach using the bootstrap method. In this way, we establish the
following (see Theorem 5.2).
Theorem 1.10. Assume that g0 is a Carathéodory function in Ω × R satisfying
g0 (x, s)

C 1 + |s|p

for all (x, s) ∈ Ω × R,

for some constant C, 1 p n+1
2, or 1 p < ∞ if n = 1, where Ω is a smooth
n−1 if n
bounded domain in Rn . Let u ∈ V0 (Ω) be a weak solution of
A1/2 u = g0 (x, u)
u=0

in Ω,
on ∂Ω.

Then, u ∈ L∞ (Ω).
The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we study the appropriate function spaces
1 (C) and V (Ω), and we give the proof of Proposition 1.8 and other related results. The
H0,L
0
regularity results of Theorem 1.9 can be found in Section 3. Maximum principles, Hopf’s lemma,
and the maximum principle in “small” domains of Proposition 1.7 are proved in Section 4. The
complete proof of Theorem 1.1 is given in Section 5 by studying the minimization problem and
applying the previous results on regularity and maximum principles. We prove Theorem 1.10
also in Section 5, while Theorems 1.3 and 1.5 are established in Section 6, and Theorem 1.6 in
Section 7.

Let Ω be a bounded smooth domain in Rn . Denote the half-cylinder with base Ω by
C = Ω × (0, ∞)
and its lateral boundary by
∂L C = ∂Ω × [0, ∞).
To treat the nonlocal problem (1.1), we will study a corresponding extension problem in one
more dimension, which allows us to investigate (1.1) by studying a local problem via classical
nonlinear variational methods. We consider the Sobolev space of functions in H 1 (C) whose
traces vanish on ∂L C:

We have that trΩ v ∈ H 1/2 (Ω), since it is well known that traces of H 1 functions are H 1/2
functions on the boundary.
Recall the well known spectral theory of the Laplacian − in a smooth bounded domain Ω
with zero Dirichlet boundary values. We repeat each eigenvalue of − in Ω with zero Dirichlet
boundary conditions according to its (finite) multiplicity:

This completes the proof of the lemma. However, if one wants to avoid the use of the fractional
Sobolev space H 1/2 (Ω), the following is an alternative simple proof.
Considering the restriction of functions in C to Ω × (0, 1), it suffices to show that the embed1 (Ω × (0, 1)) := {v ∈

H 1 (Ω × (0, 1)) | v = 0 a.e. on ∂Ω × (0, 1)} such that vm
0 weakly in H0,L
m → ∞. We may assume by the classical Rellich’s theorem in Ω × (0, 1) that vm → 0 strongly
in L2 (Ω × (0, 1)), as m → ∞. We introduce the function wm = (1 − y)vm . It is clear that

wm |Ω×{0} = vm ,
By direct computations we have

wm |Ω×{1} = 0.

Therefore, since wm = (1 − y)vm is bounded in H 1 (Ω × (0, 1)) and wm → 0 strongly in L2 (Ω ×

vm (x, 0) → 0 strongly in L2 (Ω) and hence also in L1 (Ω).

We also need to establish a trace boundary Hardy inequality, which already appeared in a

Lemma 2.6. We have that

Proof. The first statement is clear since the traces of H 1 (C) functions belong to H 1/2 (∂C).
Regarding the second statement, we prove it in two steps.
Step 1. Assume first that n = 1 and Ω = (0, 1). For 0 < x0 < 1/2, consider the segment from
(0, x0 ) to (x0 , 0) in C = (0, 1) × (0, ∞). We have

Doing the same on (1/2, 1), this establishes inequality (2.10) of the lemma.
Step 2. In the general case, after straightening a piece of the boundary ∂Ω and rescaling the new
variables, we can consider the inequality in a domain D = {x = (x , xn ) | |x | < 1, 0 < xn < 1/2}
and assume that v = 0 on {xn = 0, |x | < 1} × (0, ∞), since the flatting procedure possesses

Finally we give a concrete expression for one such bi-Lipschitz map. First, consider the onedimensional case Ω = (0, ∞). Then simply take the bi-Lipschitz map

Next we consider, for a given function u ∈ V0 (Ω), the minimizing problem:

In functional analysis, the classical spectral decomposition holds for self-adjoint compact
operators, such as the Dirichlet inverse Laplacian (− )−1 : L2 (Ω) → L2 (Ω). This is the reason
why we now define, with the aid of the Lax–Milgram theorem, a compact operator B1/2 which
will be the inverse of A1/2 .

On the other hand, let us compute B1/2 ◦ B1/2 |L2 (Ω) . Here note that since V0 (Ω) ⊂ L2 (Ω),
we have L2 (Ω) ⊂ V0∗ (Ω). For a given g ∈ L2 (Ω), let ϕ ∈ H01 (Ω) ∩ H 2 (Ω) be the solution of

On the other hand, by using (2.21) with ξ = v and Lemma 2.5, we obtain that B1/2 is a positive
compact operator in L2 (Ω). Hence by the spectral theory for self-adjoint compact operators, we
have that all the eigenvalues of B1/2 are real, positive, and that there are corresponding eigenfunctions which make up an orthonormal basis of L2 (Ω). Furthermore, such basis and eigenvalues
are explicit in terms of those of the Laplacian with Dirichlet boundary conditions, since (− )−1
has B1/2 as unique, positive and self-adjoint square root, by Proposition 2.12. Summarizing:
Proposition 2.13. Let {ϕk } be an orthonormal basis of L2 (Ω) forming a spectral decomposition of − in Ω with Dirichlet boundary conditions, as in (2.3), with {λk } the corresponding
Dirichlet eigenvalues of − in Ω. Then, for all k 1,

In particular, {ϕk } is also a basis formed by the eigenfunctions of A1/2 , with eigenvalues {λk }.
Proof of Proposition 2.1. It follows from Lemma 2.7 and Lemma 2.10.

Proof of Proposition 2.2. It follows from Lemma 2.8, Lemma 2.10 and its proof, and Propositions 2.12 and 2.13. ✷
3. Regularity of solutions
In this section we study the regularity of weak solutions for linear and nonlinear problems
involving A1/2 . First we consider the linear problem
A1/2 u = g(x)
u=0

in Ω,
on ∂Ω,

(3.1)

where g ∈ V0∗ (Ω) and Ω is a smooth bounded domain in Rn . By the construction of the previous
1 (C) with
section, the precise meaning of (3.1) is that u = trΩ v, where the function v ∈ H0,L
v(·, 0) = u ∈ V0 (Ω) satisfies
⎧ v=0
⎪
⎨
v=0
⎪
⎩ ∂v = g(x)
∂ν

in C,
on ∂L C,

(3.2)

on Ω × {0}.

We will say then that v is a weak solution of (3.2) and that u is a weak solution of (3.1).
Most of this section contains the proof of the following analogues of the W 2,p -estimates of
Calderón–Zygmund and of the Schauder estimates.
1 (C)
Proposition 3.1. Let α ∈ (0, 1), Ω be a C 2,α bounded domain of Rn , g ∈ V0∗ (Ω), v ∈ H0,L
be the weak solution of (3.2), and u = trΩ v be the weak solution of (3.1). Then,

(i) If g ∈ L2 (Ω), then u ∈ H01 (Ω).
(ii) If g ∈ H01 (Ω), then u ∈ H 2 (Ω) ∩ H01 (Ω).
(iii) If g ∈ L∞ (Ω), then v ∈ W 1,q (Ω × (0, R)) for all R > 0 and 1 < q < ∞. In particular,
v ∈ C α (C) and u ∈ C α (Ω).
(iv) If g ∈ C α (Ω) and g|∂Ω ≡ 0, then v ∈ C 1,α (C) and u ∈ C 1,α (Ω).
(v) If g ∈ C 1,α (Ω) and g|∂Ω ≡ 0, then v ∈ C 2,α (C) and u ∈ C 2,α (Ω).
As a consequence, we deduce the regularity of bounded weak solutions to the nonlinear problem
A1/2 u = f (u)
u=0

in Ω,
on ∂Ω.

As before, the precise meaning for (3.3) is that v ∈ H0,L

⎨

⎪
⎩ ∂v = f v(·, 0)
∂ν

in C,
on ∂L C,

(3.4)

on Ω × {0}.

Here the weak solution u is assumed to be bounded. Regularity results for subcritical and critical
problems and for weak solutions which are not assumed a priori to be bounded will be proved in
Section 5.
By C0 (Ω) we denote the space of continuous functions in Ω vanishing on the boundary ∂Ω.
In the following result, f (0) = 0 is assumed to ensure the C 1 (Ω) regularity of solutions of (3.3).
Proposition 3.2. Let α ∈ (0, 1), Ω be a C 2,α bounded domain of Rn , and f be a C 1,α function
1 (C) ∩ L∞ (C) is
such that f (0) = 0. If u ∈ L∞ (Ω) is a weak solution of (3.3), and thus v ∈ H0,L
a weak solution of (3.4), then u ∈ C 2,α (Ω) ∩ C0 (Ω). In addition, v ∈ C 2,α (C).
Proof. By (iii) of Proposition 3.1 we have that u ∈ C α (Ω). Next, by (iv) of Proposition 3.1 and
since on ∂Ω × {0}, g := f (v(·, 0)) = f (0) = 0, we have u ∈ C 1,α (Ω). Finally, v ∈ C 2,α (C) and
u ∈ C 2,α (Ω) from (v) of Proposition 3.1 since g = f (u) vanishes on ∂Ω and it is of class C 1,α ,
since both f and u are C 1,α . ✷
Proof of Proposition 3.1. (i) and (ii). Both statements follow immediately from Propositions 2.1
1/2
and 2.2. Simply use that {ϕk } is an orthonormal basis of L2 (Ω) and that {ϕk /λk } is an orthonormal basis of H01 (Ω). For part (ii), note that if A1/2 u = g ∈ H01 (Ω), then we have u ∈ L2 (Ω).
(iii) Let v be a weak solution of (3.2). We proceed with a useful method, introduced by Cabré
and Solà-Morales in [5], which consists of using the auxiliary function
y

w(x, y) =

v(x, t) dt

for (x, y) ∈ C.

(3.5)

0

Since ( w)y = 0 in C, we have that w is independent of y. Hence we can compute it on
{y = 0}. On {y = 0}, since w ≡ 0, we have w = wyy = vy . Thus w is a solution of the Dirichlet
problem
− w(x, y) = g(x)
w=0

in C,
on ∂C.

(3.6)

We extend w to the whole cylinder Ω × R by odd reflection:
wod (x, y) =
Moreover, we put

w(x, y)

−w(x, −y) for y

0.

god (x, y) =

g(x)
for y > 0,
−g(x) for y < 0.

Then we obtain
− wod = god
wod = 0

in Ω × R,
on ∂Ω × R.

(3.7)

Since god ∈ Lq (Ω × (−2R, 2R)) for all R > 0 and 1 < q < ∞, regularity for the Dirichlet
problem (3.7) gives wod ∈ W 2,q (Ω × (−R, R)) for all R > 0 and 1 < q < ∞. In particular,
w ∈ C 1,α (C). Therefore, v = wy ∈ C α (C) and u ∈ C α (Ω).
(iv) Choose a smooth domain H such that Ω ⊂ H , and let
gH =

g
0

in Ω,
in H \ Ω.

We have that gH ∈ C α (H ), since g|∂Ω = 0, by assumption. Consider the weak solution vH of
⎧ v =0
H
⎪
⎨
vH = 0
⎪
⎩ ∂vH = g (x)
H
∂ν

in H × (0, ∞),

on H × {0}.

Consider also the auxiliary function
y

wH (x, y) =

vH (x, t) dt

in H × [0, ∞),

0

which solves problem (3.6) with Ω and g replaced by H and gH .
Using boundary regularity theory (but away from the corners of H × [0, ∞)) for this Dirichlet
problem, we see that wH is C 2,α (H × (0, ∞)) (again, here we do not claim regularity at the
corners ∂H × {0}). Thus, wH ∈ C 2,α (C) (here instead we include the corners ∂Ω × {0} of C).
Consider the difference ϕ = wH − w in C, where w is defined by (3.5). It is clear that
⎧
⎨ ϕ=0
ϕ = wH
⎩
ϕ=0

in C,
on ∂L C,

We extend ϕ to the whole cylinder Ω × R by odd reflection:
ϕod (x, y) =

ϕ(x, y)
−ϕ(x, −y)

for y
for y

0,
0.

Moreover, we put

for y > 0,
for y 0.

X. Cabré, J. Tan / Advances in Mathematics 224 (2010) 2052–2093

2075

Then we have
ϕod = 0
ϕod = wH,od

in Ω × R,
on ∂Ω × R.

(3.8)

Since wH ∈ C 2,α (C), wH ≡ 0 on ∂Ω × {0}, and ∂yy wH = ∂y vH = −gH = −g = 0 on ∂Ω ×
{0}, we deduce that wH,od ∈ C 2,α (∂Ω × R). It follows from elliptic regularity for (3.8) that
ϕod ∈ C 2,α (Ω × R). Thus, ϕ ∈ C 2,α (C), w ∈ C 2,α (C) and v = ∂y w ∈ C 1,α (C).
(v) Choose a smooth bounded domain B such that Ω ⊂ B. B could be the same as H in (ii),
for instance a ball, but we change its name for notation clarity. Since g ∈ C 1,α (Ω), there exists
an extension gB ∈ C 1,α (B); see [15]. Consider the solution vB of

Consider the auxiliary function

0

As before, from interior boundary regularity for the Dirichlet problem of the type (3.6)
satisfied by wB , we obtain that wB ∈ C 3,α (B × [0, ∞)) since gB ∈ C 1,α (B) (away from the
corners ∂B × {0}). Thus, vB ∈ C 2,α (B × [0, ∞)). Thus, vB ∈ C 2,α (C). Consider the difference
ψ = vB − v in C, where v is a weak solution of (3.2). We have that ψ = vB − v satisfies

ψ = vB on ∂L C,

We extend ψ to the whole cylinder Ω × R now by even reflection:

Moreover, we put
vB,ev (x, y) =
Then, since

ψev = 0

in Ω × R,
on ∂Ω × R.

2076

X. Cabré, J. Tan / Advances in Mathematics 224 (2010) 2052–2093

Since vB ∈ C 2,α (C), −∂y vB = gB = g = 0 on ∂Ω × {0}, we deduce that vB,ev ∈ C 2,α (∂Ω × R).
Therefore, it follows from classical regularity that ψev ∈ C 2,α (Ω × R). Thus, ψ ∈ C 2,α (C), and
v ∈ C 2,α (C). ✷
4. Maximum principles
In this section we establish several maximum principles for A1/2 . We denote by C0 (Ω) the
space of continuous functions in Ω vanishing on the boundary ∂Ω. For convenience, we state
the results for functions in C0 (Ω) ∩ C 2 (Ω) (a space contained in H01 (Ω) ⊂ V0 (Ω)), but this can
be weakened.
The first statement is the weak maximum principle.
Lemma 4.1. Assume that u ∈ C 2 (Ω) satisfies
A1/2 u + c(x)u
u=0
where Ω is a smooth bounded domain in Rn and c

0 in Ω,
on ∂Ω,
0 in Ω. Then, u

0 in Ω.

Proof. Consider the extension v = h-ext(u). If we prove that v 0 in C, then u 0 in Ω.
Suppose by contradiction that v is negative somewhere in C. Then, since v = 0 in C and v = 0
on ∂L C, we deduce that v is negative somewhere in Ω × {0} and that infC v < 0 is achieved at
some point (x0 , 0) ∈ Ω × {0}. Thus, we have
inf v = v(x0 , 0) < 0.
C

By Hopf’s lemma,
vy (x0 , 0) > 0.
It follows
∂v
= −vy (x0 , 0) = A1/2 v(x0 , 0) < 0.
∂ν
Therefore, since c

0,
A1/2 v(x0 , 0) + c(x0 )v(x0 , 0) < 0.

This is a contradiction with the hypothesis A1/2 u + c(x)u

0.

The next statement is the strong maximum principle for A1/2 .
Lemma 4.2. Assume that u ∈ C 2 (Ω) satisfies
⎧
⎨ A1/2 u + c(x)u
u 0
⎩
u=0

where Ω is a smooth bounded domain in Rn and c ∈ L∞ (Ω). Then, either u > 0 in Ω, or u ≡ 0
in Ω.
Proof. The proof is similar to that of Lemma 4.1. Consider v = h-ext(u). We observe that v 0
in C. Suppose that v ≡ 0 but u = 0 somewhere in Ω. Then there exists a minimum point (x0 , 0) ∈
Ω × {0} of v where v(x0 , 0) = 0. Then by Hopf’s lemma we see that A1/2 u(x0 ) = −vy (x0 , 0)
< 0. This implies that A1/2 u(x0 ) + c(x0 )u(x0 ) < 0, because of v(x0 , 0) = u(x0 ) = 0. ✷
Next we establish Hopf’s lemma for A1/2 , following the proof from [9].
Lemma 4.3. Let Ω be a bounded domain in Rn and c ∈ L∞ (Ω).
(i) Assume that Ω is smooth and that 0 ≡ u ∈ C 2 (Ω) satisfies
A1/2 u + c(x)u
u 0
u=0
Then,

(ii) Assume that P ∈ ∂Ω and that ∂Ω is smooth in a neighborhood of P . Let 0 ≡ v ∈ C 2 (C) ∩
L∞ (C), where C = Ω × (0, ∞), satisfy
⎧ v=0

v 0

⎩ ∂v + c(x)v

If v(P , 0) = 0, then

∂v(P ,0)
∂ν0

on ∂L C,
0 on Ω × {0}.

< 0, where ν0 is the unit outer normal in Rn to ∂Ω.

Proof. We follow the proof given in [9]. Note that statement (i) is a particular case of (ii). Thus,
we only need to prove (ii).
Step 1. We shall first prove the lemma in the case c ≡ 0. Without loss of generality we may
assume that (P , 0) = P1 = (b1 , 0, . . . , 0) ∈ ∂Ω × {0}, b1 > 0 and ν0 = (1, 0, . . . , 0). Hence we
need to prove
∂v(P1 )
< 0.
∂x1
Since Ω is smooth in a neighborhood of P , there is a half-ball in Rn+1
+ included in the domain C,
such that P1 is the only point in the closed half-ball belonging also to ∂L C. Let P2 ∈ Ω × {0} and
r > 0 be the center and radius of such ball. Then we have P2 = (b2 , 0, . . . , 0) ∈ Ω × {0}. Denote
Br+ (P2 ) := z = (x, y) |z − P2 | < |P1 − P2 | =: r, y > 0 ⊂ C,
+
Br/2
(P2 ) := z = (x, y) |z − P2 | < |P1 − P2 |/2, y > 0 ,
+
(P2 ).
A = Br+ (P2 ) \ Br/2

Recall that P1 ∈ ∂Br+ (P2 ) ∩ (∂Ω × {0}).

Consider the function on A:
ϕ(z) = exp −λ|z − P2 |2 − exp −λ|P1 − P2 |2 ,
with λ > 0 to be determined later. Note that
ϕ = exp −λ|z − P2 |2 4λ2 |z − P2 |2 − 2(n + 1)λ .
We can choose λ > 0 large enough such that ϕ 0 in A.
On the other hand, by Lemma 4.2, we see that v > 0 in A \ {P1 }. Hence, since ϕ ≡ 0 on
∂Br+ (P2 ) ∩ {y > 0}, we can take ε > 0 such that
v − εϕ
Since − (v − εϕ)

−∂y (v − εϕ) =

∂v
∂ν

0 on ∂A ∩ {y = 0}

(recall that c ≡ 0), by the maximum principle as in Lemma 4.1 we obtain
v − εϕ

in A.

Thus, from v − εϕ = 0 at P1 we see that ∂x1 (v − εϕ)(P1 )
0. Therefore, ∂x1 v(P1 )
2
ε∂x1 ϕ(P1 ) = −2λ(b1 − b2 )e−λ|P1 −P2 | < 0. Thus we have the desired result.
Step 2. In the case c ≡ 0, we define the function w = v exp(−βy) for some β > 0 to be
determined. From a direct calculation, we see that
− w − 2β∂y w = β 2 w
and, choosing β

Finally, we establish a maximum principle for A1/2 in domains of small measure. Note that
in part (ii) of its statement, the hypothesis on small measure is made only on the base Ω of the
cylinder C.

5. Subcritical case and L∞ estimate of Brezis–Kato type
In this section, we study the nonlinear problem (1.1) with f (u) = up in the subcritical and

by weak lower semi-continuity of the Dirichlet integral and by the compact embedding property
in Lemma 2.5. Finally, note that |v| 0 is a nonnegative minimizer if v is a minimizer. ✷
To establish the regularity of the minimizer just obtained, we prove an L∞ -estimate of Brezis–

Hence, by iterating β0 = 0, βi + 1 = (βi−1 + 1) n−1
if i 1 in (5.5), we conclude that v(·, 0) ∈
Lq (Ω) for all q < ∞. Finally, the proof of part (iii) in Proposition 3.1—which only uses g ∈
Lq (Ω) for all q < ∞ and not g ∈ L∞ (Ω)—applied with g(x) = g0 (x, v(x, 0)), which satisfies
|g| C(1 + |v(·, 0)|p ) ∈ Lq (Ω) for all q < ∞, leads to v(·, 0) ∈ C α (Ω) ⊂ L∞ (Ω). ✷

Proof of Theorem 1.1. Proposition 5.1 gives the existence of a weak nonnegative solution v to
(5.1) after multiplying the nonnegative minimizer of I0 by a constant to take care of the Lagrange
multiplier. Then, Theorem 5.2 gives that v(·, 0) ∈ L∞ (Ω). Next, Proposition 3.2 gives that u ∈
C 2,α (Ω), since f (s) = |s|p is a C 1,α function for some α ∈ (0, 1). Finally, the strong maximum
principle, Lemma 4.2, leads to u > 0 in Ω. ✷

(6.1)

on Ω × {0},
in C,

where Ω ⊂ Rn is a bounded smooth domain, n 2, and 1 < p < n+1
n−1 .
For this, we need two nonlinear Liouville theorems for problems involving the square root of
the Laplacian in unbounded domains—one in the whole space, another in the half-space. The
first one was proved by Y.Y. Li, Zhang and Zhu in [18,17] and Ou in [22]. Its statement is the
following—and it is equivalent to Theorem 1.4 in the Introduction.
Theorem 6.1. (See [18,17,22].) For n

We need to prove an analogue nonlinear Liouville type result involving the square root of
− with Dirichlet boundary value in the half-space. This is Theorem 1.5 of the Introduction and
Proposition 6.3 in this section. As we will see, this nonlinear Liouville theorem in Rn+ will be
first reduced to the one-dimensional case R+ , by using the moving planes method. After this,
we prove that there exists no positive bounded solution for the nonlinear Neumann boundary
problem in the quarter R2++ , which corresponds to the nonlinear Liouville theorem involving
the square root of − with Dirichlet boundary value in the half-line; see Proposition 6.4. To
complete the proof of Theorem 1.5 we will use the following Liouville theorem in dimension
n + 1 = 2.

Then, v is a constant.
As usual, very strong Liouville theorems (but quite simple to prove) hold in low dimensions,
but not in higher ones. Compare (6.3) in low dimensions for supersolutions of the homogeneous
linear problem with (6.2) for solutions of a precise nonlinear problem. The proof of Proposition 6.2 in [9] compared in an appropriate way the solution v with log(| · |). For completeness,
we give here an alternative proof.
Proof of Proposition 6.2. Replacing v by v − infR2 v

Then, v depends only on xn and y.

Since |¯z|p(n−1)−(n+1) is nonincreasing in the z¯ i direction for all i = 1, . . . , n − 1 (in fact, in any
direction orthogonal to the z¯ n -axis), the moving planes method used as in [9] gives that w is
¯ where z¯ =
symmetric about all the z¯ i -axis for i = 1, . . . , n − 1. This leads to w = w(|¯z |, z¯ n , y),
(¯z1 , . . . , z¯ n−1 ) and hence v = v(|x |, xn , y). Now, since we may perform the Kelvin’s transform
with respect to any point (−x0 , −1, 0)—and not only with respect to x0 = 0 as before—we
conclude that v = v(xn , y) as claimed. ✷
Proposition 6.4. Assume that f is a C 1,α function for some α ∈ (0, 1), such that f > 0 in (0, ∞)

(6.8)

in R2++ .

Proof. We use some tools developed in [5].
Suppose by contradiction that there is such solution v. First, we claim that v(x, 0) → 0 as
x → ∞. Suppose by contradiction that there exists a sequence am → ∞ (m → ∞) such that
v(am , 0) → α > 0. Let vm (x, y) := v(x + am , y). It is clear that vm is a solution of (6.8) in
Um := {(x, y) | x > −am , y > 0}. Moreover, vm (0, 0) = v(am , 0) → α. Therefore there exists a
2 (R2 ) as m → ∞, and w is a solution
subsequence, still denoted by vm , such that vm → w in Cloc

⎪
⎪
⎩ ∂ν
0 w C
in {y > 0}.
Notice that
w(0, 0) = α > 0.
On the other hand, by Proposition 6.2 we know that w is identically constant. This is impossible
due to the nonlinear Neumann condition, since f > 0 in (0, ∞) and f (w(0, 0)) = f (α) > 0. We
conclude the claim, that is, v(x, 0) → 0 as x → +∞.
Note that we can reflect the function v with respect to {x = 0, y > 0}, v(x,
˜ y) = −v(−x, y)
for x < 0, and obtain a bounded harmonic function v˜ in all R2+ = {y > 0}, since v ≡ 0 on {x =
0, y > 0}. Applying interior gradient estimates to the bounded harmonic function v˜ in the ball
Bt (x, t) ⊂ R2+ , we obtain

On the other hand, by the results of [5] applied to the solution v˜ in R2+ (or equivalently by the
proof of Proposition 3.2 of this paper; note that f (0) = 0), we have that |∇v| and |D 2 v| are
bounded in R2++ ∩ {0 y 1}. We conclude that |∇v| and |D 2 v| are bounded in R2++ and

Moreover, we have

By these facts, we see that the function

dx is also.
Using that limt→∞ |∇v(x, t)| = 0, we obtain, for F (v) =

= ∂y v∂x v + f (v)∂x v (x, 0) = 0,
thanks to the harmonicity of v and the Neumann boundary condition. This leads to the
Hamiltonian-type identity
Φ(·) + F v(·, 0) is identically constant in (0, +∞).
Furthermore, using that limx→+∞ v(x, 0) = 0, and that limx→+∞ v(x, y) = 0 uniformly in
compact sets in y (we can prove this by the same previous argument leading to limx→+∞ v(x, 0)
= 0), together with the above bounds for |∇v(x, y)| for y large, we deduce
lim Φ(x) = 0.

x→+∞

From all these we obtain
Φ(x) + F v(x, 0) ≡ 0,

for x > 0.

Since v = 0 and thus ∂y v = 0 along the y-axis, we see by the definition of Φ(0) that

This implies that ∂x v = 0 on {x = 0, y > 0}, which contradicts Hopf’s lemma. Thus, the contradiction means that there is no positive bounded solution of the problem. ✷
Before proving Theorems 1.5 and 1.3, let us make some comments.
Remark 6.5. Theorem 1.5 is still open without the boundedness assumption on v.
In this respect, let us give some examples of problems in the quarter plane R2++ . The function
v(x, y) = x is an unbounded solution of the problem

− v = 0, v

0 in R2++ ,
on {x = 0, y > 0},
on {x > 0, y = 0}.

This tells us that the result of Proposition 6.2 (which did not require boundedness of the solution
in the half-plane) does not hold in the quarter plane.
x
satisfies v = 0 and −∂y v|y=0 =
On the other hand, it is clear that v(x, y) = π2 arctan y+1

0 for x > 0. Hence, there exists a bounded harmonic function in the quarter plane R2++
2(1+x 2 )

Thus the nonlinear condition

Proof of Theorem 1.5. It follows from Propositions 6.3 and 6.4.

✷

Proof of Theorem 1.3. We know by Theorem 5.2 and Proposition 3.2 that all weak solutions u

Since vm = h-ext(um ) is a positive harmonic function in C vanishing on ∂L C, we have that vm

Rn+1

a contradiction with Theorem 1.5. ✷
Remark 6.6. From Theorem 1.3 we have a priori bounds for solutions of problem (1.1) with
f (u) = up , 1 < p < n+1
n−1 . As a consequence, by using blow-up techniques and topological degree theory, one can obtain existence of positive solutions for related problems—for instance,
for nonlinearities f (x, u) of power type, as well as other boundary conditions. See Gidas and
Spruck [14] for some of these applications when the operator is the classical Laplacian.
7. Symmetry of solutions
The goal of this section is to prove a symmetry result of Gidas–Ni–Nirenberg type for positive
solutions of nonlinear problems involving the operator A1/2 , as stated in Theorem 1.6, by using
the moving planes method. For this, we work with the equivalent local problem (1.8) and derive
the following.
Theorem 7.1. Assume that Ω is a bounded smooth domain of Rn which is convex in the x1
direction and symmetric with respect to the hyperplane {x1 = 0}. Let f be Lipschitz continuous
and let v ∈ C 2 (C) be a solution of (1.8), where C = Ω × (0, +∞). Then, v is symmetric with
∂v
respect to x1 , i.e., v(−x1 , x , y) = v(x1 , x , y) for all (−x1 , x , y) ∈ C. In addition, ∂x
< 0 for
1
x1 > 0.
Proof of Theorems 1.6 and 7.1. It suffices to prove Theorem 7.1. From it, Theorem 1.6 follows
immediately.
Let x = (x1 , x ) ∈ Ω and λ > 0. Consider the sets
Σλ =

x1 , x ∈ Ω x1 > λ

and Tλ =

x1 , x ∈ Ω x1 = λ .

For x ∈ Σλ , define xλ = (2λ − x1 , x ). By the hypotheses on the domain Ω we see that
{xλ | x ∈ Σλ } ⊂ Ω.
Recall that v ∈ C 2 (C) is a solution of

For (x, y) ∈ Σλ × [0, ∞), let us define
vλ (x, y) = v(xλ , y) = v 2λ − x1 , x , y
and

Let λ∗ = sup{λ | Σλ = ∅} and let ε > 0 be a small number. If λ ∈ (λ∗ − ε, λ∗ ), then Σλ has
small measure and we have, by part (ii) of Proposition 4.4 (applied with Ω replaced with Σλ ),
that
wλ

0 in Σλ × (0, ∞).

Note here that Σλ is not a smooth domain but that part (ii) of Proposition 4.4 does not require
smoothness of the domain. By the strong maximum principle, Lemma 4.2, for problem (7.1) we
see that wλ is identically equal to zero or strictly positive in Σλ × (0, ∞). Since λ > 0, we have
wλ > 0 in (∂Ω ∩ ∂Σλ ) × (0, ∞), and hence we conclude that wλ > 0 in Σλ × (0, ∞).
Let λ0 = inf{λ > 0 | wλ 0 in Σλ × (0, ∞)}. We are going to prove that λ0 = 0. Suppose that
λ0 > 0 by contradiction. First, by continuity, we have wλ0 0 in Σλ0 × (0, ∞). Then, as before,
we deduce wλ0 > 0 in Σλ0 × (0, ∞). Next, let δ > 0 be a constant and K ⊂ Σλ0 be a compact
set such that |Σλ0 \ K| δ/2. We have wλ0 (·, 0) η > 0 in K for some constant η, since K is
compact. Thus, we obtain that wλ0 −ε (·, 0) > 0 in K and that |Σλ0 −ε \ K| δ for ε small enough.
Now we apply again part (ii) of Proposition 4.4 in Σλ0 −ε × (0, ∞) to the function wλ0 −ε .
We know that wλ0 −ε (·, 0) 0 in K, and hence {wλ0 −ε < 0} ⊂ Σλ0 −ε \ K, which has measure at
most δ. We take δ to be the constant of part (ii) of Proposition 4.4. We deduce that
wλ0 −ε

0 in Σλ0 −ε × (0, ∞).

This is a contradiction to the definition of λ0 . Thus, λ0 = 0.
We have proved, letting λ ↓ λ0 = 0 that
v −x1 , x , y
and, since wλ = 0 on Tλ ,

v x1 , x , y

in Ω ∩ {x1 > 0} × (0, ∞)
