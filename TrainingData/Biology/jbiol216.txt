Abstract
Background: The TSC-22 domain family (TSC22DF) consists of putative transcription factors harboring a DNAbinding TSC-box and an adjacent leucine zipper at their carboxyl termini. Both short and long TSC22DF isoforms are
conserved from flies to humans. Whereas the short isoforms include the tumor suppressor TSC-22 (Transforming
growth factor-β1 stimulated clone-22), the long isoforms are largely uncharacterized. In Drosophila, the long isoform
Bunched A (BunA) acts as a growth promoter, but how BunA controls growth has remained obscure.
Results: In order to test for functional conservation among TSC22DF members, we expressed the human TSC22DF
proteins in the fly and found that all long isoforms can replace BunA function. Furthermore, we combined a
proteomics-based approach with a genetic screen to identify proteins that interact with BunA. Madm (Mlf1 adapter
molecule) physically associates with BunA via a conserved motif that is only contained in long TSC22DF proteins.
Moreover, Drosophila Madm acts as a growth-promoting gene that displays growth phenotypes strikingly similar to
bunA phenotypes. When overexpressed, Madm and BunA synergize to increase organ growth.
Conclusions: The growth-promoting potential of long TSC22DF proteins is evolutionarily conserved. Furthermore,
we provide biochemical and genetic evidence for a growth-regulating complex involving the long TSC22DF protein
BunA and the adapter molecule Madm.

Background
A prevalent model of carcinogenesis suggests that
sequential activation of oncogenes and inactivation of
tumor suppressor genes occur in a multistep process
leading to deviant growth. Over the past decades much
effort has been put into identifying tumor suppressor
genes and their pathways because they represent
attractive drug targets for cancer therapy. On the basis of
expression data derived from various human and murine
tumor tissues, Transforming growth factor-β1 stimulated
clone-22 (TSC-22) - originally identified as a TGF-β1responsive gene [1] - is believed to be a tumor suppressor
gene [2-5]. TSC-22 exhibits pro-apoptotic functions in
cancer cell lines [6,7], and a recent study reported that
genetic disruption of the TSC-22 gene in mice causes

higher proliferation and repopulation efficiency of
hematopoietic precursor cells, consistent with a role of
TSC-22 in tumor suppression [8]. However, TSC-22
knock­out mice do not display enhanced tumorigenesis.
Because TSC-22 possesses a leucine zipper and a novel
motif capable of binding DNA in vitro - the TSC-box [9] TSC-22 is likely to operate as a transcription factor.
Alter­natively, TSC-22 might act as transcriptional regu­
lator as it binds to Smad4 via the TSC-box and modu­lates
the transcriptional activity of Smad4 [10]. Further­more,
Fortilin (TCTP) binds to and destabilizes TSC-22,
thereby impeding TSC-22-mediated apoptosis [11].
Unraveling the precise mechanism by which TSC-22
acts is demanding because there are several mammalian
genes homologous to TSC-22 that could have, at least in
part, redundant functions. TSC-22 is affiliated with the
TSC-22 domain family (TSC22DF) consisting of putative
transcription factors that are characterized by a carboxyterminal leucine zipper and an adjacent TSC-box. This
protein family is conserved from Caenorhabditis elegans

to humans and is encoded by four separate loci in
mammals, TSC22D1 to TSC22D4. These loci produce
several isoforms that can be subdivided into a short and a
long class depending on the length of the isoformspecific amino-terminal sequences and depending on the
presence of two conserved, as-yet-uncharacterized motifs
in the amino-terminal part of the long isoforms [12,13].
In addition to the (partial) redundancy, synergistic and/
or antagonistic functions among TSC-22 (TSC22D1.2)
and its homologs are likely as TSC22DF proteins can
form heterodimers [13] and may compete for common
binding partners or target genes.
The short class of TSC22DF variants, including TSC-22
(TSC22D1.2), is well studied. In mice, TSC22D2 produces
several short transcripts that are important for the osmotic
stress response of cultured murine kidney cells [14].
TSC22D3v2, also known as Gilz (gluco­corticoid-induced
leucine zipper), is required in the immune system for
T-cell receptor mediated cell death [15-18]. Moreover, Gilz
is a direct target gene of the transcription factor FoxO3
[19], and several binding partners of the Gilz protein are
known, including NF-κB, c-Jun, c-Fos and Raf-1 [20-22].
In addition, short isoforms encoded by TSC22D3 have
differential functions in the aldosterone response, sodium
homeostasis and proliferation of kidney cells [23].
The function of long TSC22DF members is less well
understood. The long isoform TSC22D1.1, produced by
the TSC-22 locus, as well as the long human TSC22D2
protein are largely uncharacterized. TSC22D4 is impor­
tant for pituitary development [24] and can form hetero­
dimers with TSC-22 (TSC22D1.2) [13]. Functional in
vivo studies on TSC22DF, especially on the long isoforms,
are needed to clarify how TSC-22 (TSC22D1.2) can act
as a tumor suppressor.
Drosophila melanogaster is a valuable model organism
for investigating the function of TSC22DF proteins in
growth regulation for two reasons. First, many tumor
suppressor genes [25] and growth-regulating pathways
[26,27] have been successfully studied in the fly. Second,
the Drosophila genome contains a single locus, bunched
(bun), encoding three nearly identical long and five short
isoforms of TSC22DF members (FlyBase annotation
FB2009_05 [28]). Thus, the redundancy and complexity
of interactions among TSC22DF proteins are markedly
lower in Drosophila than in mammals. Drosophila bun is
important for oogenesis, eye development and the proper
formation of the embryonic peripheral nervous system
[29-31]. Furthermore, bun is required for the develop­
ment of α/β neurons of the mushroom body, a brain
structure involved in learning and memory [32]. It has
been proposed that bun acts as a mitotic factor during
the development of α/β neurons.
Two studies that we and others carried out [12,33] have
demonstrated that, in addition to its role in patterning

Page 2 of 15

processes, bun plays a crucial role in growth regulation.
Whereas the long Bun isoforms are positive growth
regulators, genetic disruption of the short transcripts
bunB-E and bunH does not alter growth. However, over­
expression of bunB and bunC does interfere in a
dominant-negative manner with normal bunA function.
These results on Drosophila bun apparently contradict
data describing mammalian TSC-22 as a growthsuppres­sing gene. To resolve this conflict, we hypothe­
sized that the as-yet-uncharacterized long TSC-22
isoform (TSC22D1.1) is a functional homolog of BunA in
growth regulation and that it is antagonized by the short
isoform TSC22D1.2.
Here we investigate the evolutionary functional conser­
vation between BunA and the human TSC22DF proteins.
We report that long TSC-22 (TSC22D1.1) as well as the
long human isoforms TSC22D2 and TSC22D4 can
substitute for BunA function but the short isoforms
cannot. In addition, we demonstrate that the growthpromoting function of BunA is - at least in part mediated by Mlf1 adapter molecule (Madm). We have
identified Madm in a genetic screen for growth regulators
as well as in a proteomic screen for BunA-interacting
proteins, and we show that BunA and Madm cooperate
in promoting growth during development.

Results
Long human TSC22DF proteins can substitute for BunA in
Drosophila

We hypothesized that the long isoform encoded by the
TSC-22 locus, TSC22D1.1, is a functional homolog of
BunA with growth-promoting capacity, and that it is
antagonized by the short isoform TSC22D1.2. Therefore,
we tested whether human TSC22D1.1 or any other
TSC22DF member is able to replace BunA function in
Drosophila. The UAS/Gal4 expression system [34] was
combined with a site-specific integration system [35] to
express the TSC22DF members. Ubiquitous expression
of the long - but not of the short - human TSC22DF
isoforms (Figure 1a) resulted in a rescue of the lethality of
bun mutants carrying a deletion allele (200B) that is likely
to be null for all bun isoforms [12] (Figure 1b). Thus,
TSC22D1.1 has the ability to replace BunA function in
the fly whereas TSC22D1.2 does not. Furthermore, all
long human TSC22DF isoforms can act in place of BunA
in Drosophila, suggesting that sequences conserved in the
long isoforms enable BunA to promote growth.
Madm (Mlf1 adapter molecule) interacts biochemically
with BunA

How BunA exerts its growth-regulating function is
unknown. It is conceivable that a protein specifically
binding to long TSC22DF isoforms accounts for the
growth-promoting ability. Therefore, we set out to identify

Figure 1. Long human TSC22DF isoforms can replace BunA
function in Drosophila. (a) Schematic drawing of human and
Drosophila TSC22DF proteins that were tested for their ability to
rescue the lethality of bun mutants. The long isoforms possess two
short conserved stretches named motif 1 and motif 2. Whereas
BunA represents the long TSC22DF isoforms in Drosophila, BunB and
BunC are two of the short isoforms. (b) Expression of long TSC22DF
isoforms restores the viability of bun mutants. The quality of the
rescue is indicated as a percentage of the expected Mendelian
ratio. The Gal4 driver lines are ordered according to the strength of
ubiquitous expression they direct during development, with armGal4 being the weakest and Act5C-Gal4 the strongest driver line.
In each experimental cross, n ≥ 200 progeny flies were analyzed.
Leaky expression, without Gal4; 1 c and 2 c, one or two copies of the
respective UAS construct. The ZH-attP-86Fb integration site seems to
mediate strong expression as the UAS-attB-bunA constructs (ORF and
cDNA) do not need to be driven by a Gal4 line for rescue, in contrast
to the UAS-bunA construct (cDNA) generated by standard P-elementmediated germline transformation (inserted non-site-specifically
on chromosome III). Note that too high expression of long TSC22DF
members is harmful to flies. In a wild-type background, Act5CGal4-directed expression (n ≥ 200) of TSC22D2 and of bunA ORF kills
the animals (0% survival). Expression from the bunA cDNA construct
produces few escapers (3%), whereas expression from the bunA cDNA
P-element construct and of TSC22D4 results in semi-viability (14% and
69%, respectively). Only TSC22D1.1 can be expressed by Act5C-Gal4
without compromising survival (>80%). Thus, there appears to be an
optimal range of long TSC22DF concentration for viability.

binding partners by means of pulldown experi­ments
combining affinity purification and mass spectrometry

(AP-MS) [36,37]. As baits, we expressed green fluores­
cent protein (GFP)- or hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged
versions of the full-length BunA protein (rather than
BunA-specific peptides, which might not preserve the
three-dimensional structure of BunA) in Drosophila S2
cells and affinity purified the protein complexes by means
of anti-GFP or anti-HA beads, respectively. The purified
complexes were analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry
(LC-MS/MS), and the proteins identified were judged as
good candidates if they satisfied the following three
criteria: they were not found in control experiments
(HA-tagged GFP was used as bait and affinity purified
using anti-GFP or anti-HA beads); they showed up in
several independent AP-MS experiments; and they had
an identification probability above an arbitrary threshold
(Mascot score 50). We identified the adapter protein
Madm as a good candidate in two independent experi­
ments [see Additional file 1].
To confirm the binding between Madm and BunA,
inverse pulldown assays using HA-Madm as bait were
carried out in S2 cells. Endogenous BunA co-immuno­
precipitated with HA-tagged Madm expressed under
the control of a metallothionein-inducible promoter
(Figure  2a). Moreover, BunA showed up as putative
Madm binding partner in an AP-MS experiment [see
Additional file 1].
Assuming that BunA and Madm interact, they should
at least partially co-localize. Immunofluorescence studies
in S2 cells revealed that GFP-BunA and HA-Madm
signals in fact largely overlapped (Figure 2b,c). Interest­
ingly, the HA-Madm signal was less dispersed when
GFP-BunA was expressed in the same cell, indicating that
the interaction with BunA altered the subcellular locali­
za­tion of HA-Madm (Figure 2c). A statistical analysis
(Materials and methods) revealed that HA-Madm was
only localized in punctae when co-overexpressed with
GFP-BunA (100%, n = 50) but not when co-overexpressed
with GFP (0%, n = 50). Moreover, when a mutated
HA-Madm protein (R525H, see below) was expressed,
the localization in punctae was lost in 66% of cells
co-overexpressing GFP-BunA (n = 50). The GFP-BunA
signal largely overlapped with the Golgi marker
GMAP210 [38] but not with an endoplasmic reticulum
(ER) marker (Figure 2d, and data not shown), indicating
that GFP-BunA localizes to the Golgi. The localization of
BunA and Madm was not dependent on their tag because
GFP- and HA-tagged BunA and Madm behaved similarly
(data not shown). Furthermore, GFP-tagged BunA and
Madm proteins were functional because they rescued the
lethality of bun and Madm mutants, respectively, when
expressed in the fly (Materials and methods). Taken
together, our AP-MS and co-localization studies demon­
strate that the adapter molecule Madm associates with
BunA.

GFP‑BunA in every cell was transiently transfected with a plasmid leading to expression of HA-Madm in a subset of cells (and vice versa in c-c”).
Co‑overexpression of GFP-BunA influences the localization of HA-Madm, resulting in a less dispersed pattern (c-c”). (d) GFP-BunA co-localizes with
the Golgi marker GMAP210 (Golgi microtubule-associated protein of 210 kDa) [38]. (e,f) Schematic drawing of BunA (e) and Madm (f ) constructs
tested in Y2H and co-IP assays for an interaction with full-length Madm and BunA, respectively. The results of the Y2H and co-IP experiments are
summarized on the left [see Additional files 2 and 3 for the primary results]. The physical interaction of BunA and Madm is mediated by a short
protein sequence encompassing the conserved motif 2 in BunA and a carboxy-terminal sequence in Madm, respectively [see Additional file 4 for
alignments].

Madm binds to a long-isoform-specific sequence in BunA

To investigate whether Madm binds to long-isoformspecific sequences, we mapped the Madm-binding region
in BunA, and vice versa, by means of co-immuno­
precipitation (co-IP) and yeast two-hybrid (Y2H)
experiments. The advantage of the Y2H system is that
Drosophila bait proteins are unlikely to form complexes
or dimers - in case of BunA via its leucine zipper - with
endogenous yeast proteins and therefore the observed
Y2H interactions are presumably direct. Our co-IP and
Y2H data indicated that a long-isoform-specific aminoterminal sequence of BunA (amino acids 475-553)
encom­passing motif 2 is sufficient for the interaction
with Madm (Figure 2e and Additional file 2). More­over,
one of the two point mutations isolated in a genetic
screen that affect motif 2 (the hypomorphic bun alleles
A-R508W and A-P519L; see Additional data file 4 and
[12]) weakened the binding to Madm.
The BunA-binding domain in Drosophila Madm was
reciprocally mapped by means of co-IP and Y2H
experiments to the carboxy-terminal amino acids 458566 (Figure 2f and Additional file 3). Furthermore, we
found that amino acids 530-566, including a nuclear

export signal (NES) and a predicted nuclear-receptorbinding motif (LXXLL) in mammals, were not dispen­
sable for the binding to BunA [see Additional file 4]. In
addition, a point mutation leading to the arginine to
histidine substitution R525H disrupted BunA-binding
(the point mutation derived from the Madm allele 4S3;
Figure 3e). Thus, Madm is a Bun-interacting protein that
specifically binds the long Bun isoforms.
Drosophila Madm is a growth-promoting gene

In a parallel genetic screen based on the eyFLP/FRT
recombinase system, we were searching for mutations
that cause growth phenotypes akin to the bunA pheno­
type [12]. A complementation group consisting of seven
recessive lethal mutations was mapped to the Madm
genomic locus (Materials and methods). The seven ethyl
methanesulfonate (EMS)-induced mutations caused a
small head (pinhead) phenotype; therefore, the affected
gene encodes a positive growth regulator (Figure 3b,c).
The rather compact genomic locus of Madm contains
two exons and produces a single protein isoform (Figure 3e).
The adapter protein Madm possesses a kinase-like
domain that lacks the conserved ATP-binding motif, thus

the genetic screen and the sites of their EMS-induced mutations are in red. Amino acid changes in the protein are indicated. In alleles 3Y2 and
7L2, the first nucleotide downstream of the first Madm exon is mutated, thus disrupting the splice donor site. In allele 2D2, a deletion causes a
frameshift after amino acid 385, resulting in a premature translational stop after an additional 34 amino acids. Alleles 3Y2, 4S3, and 7L2 lead to a
pinhead phenotype of intermediate strength (b) whereas 2D2, 2U3, and 3G5 produce a stronger pinhead phenotype (c). The hypomorphic allele
3T4 generates a weak pinhead phenotype (data not shown). Genotypes of the flies shown are: (a) y, w, eyFlp/y, w; FRT82B/FRT82B, w+, cl3R3; (b,c) y, w,

rendering it a non-functional kinase [39,40]. Moreover,
Drosophila Madm carries several conserved NESs and a
non-conserved nuclear localization signal (NLS; Figure 3e)
[40]. We identified molecular lesions in all seven EMSinduced mutations (six point mutations and one deletion;
Figure 3e) by sequencing the Madm open reading frame
(ORF). Expression of a genomic Madm as well as of a
UAS-Madm construct was sufficient to rescue the
lethality of the seven alleles and one copy of the genomic
Madm construct fully reverted the pinhead phenotype
(Materials and methods; Figure 3d), proving that Madm
mutations caused the growth deficit.
Allelic series of the EMS-induced Madm mutations

To characterize the Madm growth phenotype more closely,
we first attempted to order the Madm alleles according to
their strength. To determine the lethal phase of the recessive

lethal Madm EMS-alleles, they were combined with a
deficiency (Df(3R)Exel7283) uncovering the Madm locus
(see also Materials and methods). Development of mutant
larvae ceased mostly in the third larval instar and in the
prepupal stage. The onset of the prepupal stage was delayed
by 2 to 10 days. Alleles 2D2, 2U3, and 3G5 led to strong
growth deficits, most apparent in L3 larvae, whereas alleles
3Y2, 4S3, and 7L2 caused almost no reduction in larval size.
The allele 3T4 turned out to be a hypomorphic allele capable
of produc­ing few adult flies (less than 10% of the expected
Mendelian ratio). 3T4 is caused by a point mutation leading
to a premature translational stop (Figure 3e). However, it
has been reported that the translation machinery can use
alternative start codons in human Madm that are located
further downstream [39]. Alter­native start codons are also
present in Drosophila Madm and may account for the
hypomorphic nature of the allele 3T4.

Gluderer et al. Journal of Biology 2010, 9:9
http://jbiol.com/content/9/1/9

As a second measurement of the strength of the Madm
alleles, the severity of the pinhead phenotypes was
judged. Consistent with the first assay, alleles 2D2, 2U3,
and 3G5 produced the most severe pinhead phenotypes
(Figure 3c); alleles 3Y2, 4S3, and 7L2 displayed pinhead
phenotypes of intermediate strength (Figure 3b); and
allele 3T4 led to a very mild reduction in head and eye
size in the eyFLP/FRT assay (data not shown).
Like BunA, Madm regulates cell number and cell size

We further characterized the Madm growth phenotype
by testing effects on cell number and cell size. To assess
cell number, ommatidia were counted in scanning
electron microscope (SEM) pictures taken of mosaic eyes
largely homozygous mutant for Madm. Compared to
control mosaic eyes (Figure 4a), Madm mutant eyes
(Figure 4b,c) had significantly fewer ommatidia (Figure 4d).
To detect changes in cell size, we determined the size of
rhabdomeres - the light-sensing organelles of the photo­
receptors - in tangential eye sections containing homo­zy­
gous mutant clones (Figure 4a’-c’). In addition, we
measured the entire cell bodies of photoreceptor cells.
Madm mutant rhabdomeres and photoreceptor cell
bodies were smaller than the controls (by 29-56%;
Figure 4e, and data not shown). The reduction was cellautonomous because only homozygous mutant photo­
receptor cells (marked by the absence of pigmentation)
were affected.
Furthermore, the body size of rare hypomorphic
mutant flies (produced with allele 3T4) was reduced
(Figure  4f ), and females were almost 40% lighter than
controls (Figure 4g). Madm escapers also displayed mal­
for­mations such as eye and wing defects. Eye sections
revealed rotation defects, missing and extra photo­
receptors, fused ommatidia, and cell-fate transformations
(Figure 4h, and data not shown). Similar patterning
defects were observed in Madm mutant clones in the eye
(Figure 4b’,c’). The wing phenotypes ranged from no
defects to wing notches and an incomplete wing vein V
(Figure 4i). All the growth and patterning defects of
Madm mutant viable flies were reverted by a genomic
rescue construct (Figure 4f,g; data not shown).
Thus, Madm controls cell number and cell size and also
controls patterning processes in the eye and the wing.
These phenotypes strongly resemble phenotypes displayed
by bunA mutant cells and flies [12] [see Additional file 5
for wing notches], although the pinhead phenotype and
the eye-patterning defects caused by the strong Madm
alleles 2D2 and 3G5 are more severe.
Madm and BunA cooperate to enhance growth

Madm is a growth-promoting gene producing pheno­
types reminiscent of bunA phenotypes and its gene
product physically interacts with BunA. It is thus

Page 6 of 15

conceivable that the two proteins participate in the same
complex to enhance growth. We tested for dominant
genetic interactions between Madm and bunA in vivo.
However, we did not detect dominant interactions in
hypomorphic mutant tissues or flies (data not shown).
Thus, we hypothesized that Madm and BunA form a
molecular complex and, as a consequence, the phenotype
of the limiting complex component is displayed. This
hypothesis also implies that overexpression of Madm or
BunA alone would not be sufficient to enhance the
activity of the complex. As previously reported, over­
expres­sion of bunA from a UAS-bunA construct did not
produce any overgrowth phenotypes, unless co-over­
expressed with dS6K in a sensitized system in the wing
[12] (Figure 5b,g). Similarly, with a UAS-Madm trans­genic
line, no obvious overgrowth phenotypes were observed
(Figure 5c,h; Madm overexpression caused patterning
defects, Materials and methods). However, co-over­
expres­sion of bunA and Madm by means of GMR-Gal4
resulted in larger eyes due to larger ommatidia (Figure 5d,e).
Consistently, co-overexpression of UAS-Madm together
with UAS-bunA using a wing driver (C10-Gal4) caused
an overgrowth phenotype in the wing (Figure 5i,j). We
observed additional tissue between the wing veins,
resulting in crinkled wings. Thus, Madm and BunA
cooperate to increase organ growth when overexpressed
during eye and wing development.

Discussion
In the present study, we provide genetic evidence for an
evolutionarily conserved function of the long TSC22DF
isoforms in the control of cell and organ size. Because the
long TSC22DF proteins share two conserved motifs in
their amino-terminal parts, we set out to identify specific
binding partners that cooperate with the long isoforms to
promote cellular growth. The combination of AP-MS
experiments with a genetic screen for novel mutations
affecting growth [41] resulted in the identification of
Madm as a strong candidate for such an interactor,
illustrating the synergistic forces of the two approaches.
The long TSC22DF proteins promote growth in Drosophila
via an interaction with Madm

We found that all long - but none of the short - members
of the human TSC22DF are able to replace the function
of BunA in the fly. Thus, the potential of long isoforms to
positively regulate growth has been conserved through
evolution. Conceivably, the various long isoforms present
in mammals can, at least to some extent, substitute for
one another and hence act in a (partially) redundant
manner. However, our rescue experiments in Drosophila
only demonstrate the potential of the long human
TSC22DF proteins and do not allow us to draw any
conclusions about their endogenous function. Whether

Figure 4. The Madm loss- or reduction-of-function phenotypes strongly resemble bunA phenotypes. (a-c) Scanning electron micrographs
of eyFLP/FRT mosaic eyes. (d) Madm mosaic heads (b,c) contain significantly fewer ommatidia than control mosaic heads (a) (n = 6). (a’-c’) Images
of tangential eye sections showing that Madm mutant (unpigmented) ommatidia (b’,c’) display an autonomous reduction in rhabdomere size
relative to wild-type sized (pigmented) ommatidia. Furthermore, differentiation defects such as misrotation and missing photoreceptors are
observed in Madm mutant ommatidia. Clones were induced 24-48 h after egg deposition using the hsFLP/FRT technique. (e) Rhabdomere size
of Madm-mutant ommatidia is significantly reduced (by 29-56%). The area enclosed by rhabdomeres of photoreceptors R1-R6 in unpigmented
mutant ommatidia was compared to the area measured in pigmented wild-type sized ommatidia. For each genotype, three pairs of ommatidia
without differentiation defects from three different eye sections were measured (n = 9). Significant changes are marked by asterisks, **p < 0.01 and
***p < 0.001 (Student’s t-test) in (d) and (e). (f) Heteroallelic combinations of the hypomorphic Madm allele 3T4 produce few viable small flies (<10%
of the expected Mendelian ratio) that can be rescued by one copy of a genomic Madm rescue construct. (g) The dry weight of Madm hypomorphic
females is reduced by 37% compared to control flies (Df/+). One copy of a genomic rescue construct restores normal weight. The genomic rescue
construct has no significant dominant effect on dry weight (‘rescue Df/+’ females do not significantly differ from ‘Df/+’ females). n = 15, except for

TSC22D1.1 is indeed a functional homolog of BunA in
growth regulation and whether the short TSC22D1.2
protein antagonizes it need to be addressed in mam­
malian in vivo systems.
The potential of long human TSC22DF proteins to
replace BunA function is likely to reside in conserved

sequences shared by all long TSC22DF members.
Alignments with long TSC22DF proteins revealed two
short stretches of high conservation [12,13]. Intriguingly,
two EMS-induced mutations leading to amino acid
substitutions in the second conserved motif were isolated
in a genetic screen for mutations affecting growth [12].

Figure 5. Co-overexpression of Madm and bunA causes overgrowth. (a-d) Scanning electron micrographs of adult eyes as a readout for
the consequences of overexpression of bunA and Madm under the control of the GMR-Gal4 driver line late during eye development. Whereas
expression of (b) bunA or (c) Madm singly does not cause a size alteration compared to the control (a), overexpression of both leads to increased
eye size (d). (e) The size increase on bunA and Madm coexpression is due to larger ommatidia (Student’s t-test, n = 9, ***p < 0.001). (f-i) The growthpromoting effect of bunA and Madm co-overexpression is also observed in the wing. Single expression of either (g,g’) bunA or (h,h’) Madm during
wing development (by means of C10-Gal4) does not change wing size or curvature visibly. However, their combined expression causes a slight
overgrowth of the tissue between the wing veins, resulting in a wavy wing surface and wing bending (i’), manifested as folds between wing veins
in (i) (arrows). Genotypes are: (a) y, w; GMR-Gal4/UAS-eGFP; UAS-lacZ/+; (b) y, w; GMR-Gal4/UAS-eGFP; UAS-bunA/+; (c) y, w; GMR-Gal4/UAS-Madm;

The corresponding alleles behaved as strong bunA hypo­
morphs that were recessive lethal and caused severe
growth deficits. BunA binds via the second conserved
motif to Madm and at least one mutation weakens the
binding but does not abolish it. As the motif 2 is present
in all long TSC22DF isoforms, it is likely that all of them
can bind Madm. In fact, the long human isoform
TSC22D4 is able to do so, as uncovered in a large-scale
Y2H study [42,43]. So far, we could not assign any
function to the first conserved motif. Because this motif
is heavily phosphorylated [44], we speculate that it is
important for the regulation of BunA activity.
Because short isoforms can heterodimerize with long
isoforms, as reported for TSC-22 (TSC22D1.2) and
TSC22D4 [13], they may interact indirectly with Madm.
This could explain why human Madm was found to
interact with the bait protein TSC-22 (TSC22D1.2) in a
high-throughput analysis of protein-protein interactions
by immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry
(IP/MS) [43,45]. Moreover, we found that the short
isoform BunB interacts with Drosophila Madm in a co-IP
but not in a Y2H assay. Heterodimers of BunA and short
Bun isoforms exist in Drosophila S2 cells because we

found that a small fraction of endogenous BunA did
co-immunoprecipitate with tagged BunB and BunC
versions (data not shown). However, we failed to identify
short Bun isoforms as BunA heterodimerization partners
in the AP-MS experiments. One possible explanation is
that the peptides specific for short Bun isoforms are very
low abundant. This might also explain why they were not
detected when a catalog of the Drosophila proteome was
generated [46].
In mammalian cells, both IP/MS and Y2H experiments
provided evidence for a physical interaction between
Madm and TSC22DF proteins [42,43]. Our study extends
these findings in two ways. We demonstrate that only
long TSC22DF proteins directly bind to Madm, and we
also provide evidence for the biological significance of
this interaction in growth control.
Biological functions of Madm

Madm has been implicated in ER-to-Golgi trafficking
because overexpression of Madm affected the intra­
cellular transport of a Golgi-associated marker in COS-1
cells [47]. In addition, Madm localizes to the nucleus, the
cytoplasm and Golgi membranes in Drosophila, and an

Gluderer et al. Journal of Biology 2010, 9:9
http://jbiol.com/content/9/1/9

RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated knockdown of
Madm in cultured cells interfered with constitutive
protein secretion [46,48]. In Xenopus, Madm is important
for eye development and differentiation [49]. Thus, it is
apparent that Madm is involved in biological processes
other than growth control. As a consequence, disruption
of Madm leads to complex phenotypes partly different
from bunA phenotypes, and concomitant loss of Madm
and bunA causes an even stronger growth decrease than
the single mutants [see Additional file 5]. In addition to
the Madm growth phenotypes, we observed patterning
defects, for example in the adult fly eye and wing. Similar
phenotypes were detected when bunA function was
absent or diminished [12], yet the patterning defects
caused by Madm and the Madm pinhead phenotype
appeared to be more pronounced. Alternatively, these
more pronounced phenotypes could arise from a lower
protein stability of Madm compared with BunA, leading
to more severe phenotypes in the eyFLP/FRT assay.
However, in contrast to the effects of BunA over­expres­
sion, the overexpression of Madm early during eye and
wing development led to severe differentiation defects.
These phenotypes could be caused by Madm-interaction
partners other than BunA that function in different
biological processes.
Madm is an adapter molecule that has several inter­
action partners in mammals. Originally, it was proposed
that Madm - also named nuclear receptor binding
protein 1 (NRBP1) in humans - binds to nuclear receptors
because of the presence of two putative nuclear-receptorbinding motifs [39]. However, Madm has never been
experimentally shown to bind to any nuclear receptor.
Furthermore, the nuclear-receptor-binding motifs are
not conserved in Drosophila. From studies in mammalian
cells, it is known that Madm can bind to murine Mlf1
[40], Jab1 (Jun activation domain-binding protein 1) [50],
activated Rac3 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 3)
[47], Elongin B [51], and the host cellular protein NS3 of
dengue virus type 2 [52]. Indeed, in our AP-MS experi­
ment where HA-Madm was used as bait, we identified
Elongin B but not Mlf1 (dMlf in Drosophila), Jab1 (CSN5
in Drosophila) or Rac3 (RhoL in Drosophila). It is
possible that these interactions are not very prominent or
even absent in Drosophila S2 cells.
The Madm-BunA growth-promoting complex

Madm and BunA are limiting components of a newly
identified growth-promoting complex because genetic
disruptions of bunA and Madm both result in a reduction
in cell number and cell size. However, to enhance the
activity of the complex and thereby to augment organ
growth, simultaneous overexpression of both compo­
nents is required. In the reduction-of-function situation,
we did not detect genetic interactions between bunA and

Page 9 of 15

Madm. Thus, we hypothesize that both proteins are
essential components of a growth-promoting complex.
As a consequence, the phenotype of the limiting protein
will be displayed no matter whether the levels of the
other protein are normal or lowered.
It is not clear whether additional proteins are part of
the Madm-BunA growth-regulating complex. Hetero­
dimeri­zation partners of BunA or other Madm-binding
proteins are candidate complex members. Conversely,
Madm-binding partners could form distinct complexes
mediating different functions. These complexes may
negatively regulate each other by competing for their
shared interaction partner Madm. Indeed, we observed a
suppressive effect when dMlf or CSN5 were co-over­
expressed along with Madm and BunA in the developing
eye (data not shown). Thus, other Madm-binding
partners will directly or indirectly influence the growthpromoting function of the Madm-BunA complex.
We found that GFP-BunA co-localizes with the Golgi
marker GMAP210 in Drosophila S2 cells. Interestingly, it
has been suggested that mammalian as well as Drosophila
Madm plays a role in ER-to-Golgi transport, and it has
been reported that Madm localizes to the cytoplasm,
weakly to the nucleus, and to the Golgi in Drosophila S2
cells [48]. We observed a similar subcellular localization
of both HA-Madm and HA-Madm(R525H) when
expressed at low levels (data not shown). The Golgi
localization was lost in cells expressing higher levels of
HA-Madm, possibly because the cytoplasm was loaded
with protein. Intriguingly, the Golgi localization of
HA-Madm, but not of HA-Madm(R525H), was com­
pletely restored in cells coexpressing GFP-BunA and
HA-Madm at relatively high levels. Thus, BunA is able to
direct Madm to the Golgi, and the Golgi may be the site
of action of the Madm-BunA growth-regulating complex.
However, because our investigation was restricted to
overexpression studies, the subcellular localization of
endogenous Madm and BunA remains to be analyzed.
How could binding of Madm modulate the function of
BunA? Madm could have an impact on the stability, the
activity or the subcellular localization of BunA. We
analy­zed the amount of endogenous and overexpressed
BunA protein in cultured Drosophila cells with dimin­
ished or elevated Madm levels, produced by RNAi with
double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) or by over­expression,
respectively, but did not observe any effect (data not
shown). Thus, Madm does not fundamentally affect the
stability of BunA. The putative transcription factor BunA
localizes to the cytoplasmic and not to the nuclear
fractions in Drosophila [31,46]. Because Madm possesses
NES and NLS sequences, it is likely to shuttle between
the cytoplasm and the nucleus [52] and it might therefore
transport BunA to the nucleus, where BunA could act as
a transcription factor. So far, however, we have not

Gluderer et al. Journal of Biology 2010, 9:9
http://jbiol.com/content/9/1/9

detected nuclear translocation of BunA (data not shown).
The activity of BunA could be controlled by phosphory­
lation events, as it has been described for numerous
transcription factors. An attractive model is that a kinase
binding to Madm phosphorylates BunA. An analogous
model was proposed for murine Mlf1 as Madm binds to
an unknown kinase that phosphorylates Madm itself
and a 14-3-3zeta-binding site in Mlf1, possibly resulting
in 14-3-3-mediated sequestration of Mlf1 in the
cytoplasm [40].
Further studies will be required to solve the exact
mechanism by which Madm and BunA team up to
control growth. We anticipate that our findings will
encourage studies in mammalian systems on the function
of long TSC22DF members, in particular TSC22D1.1, in
growth control.

Conclusions
The mechanism by which the tumor suppressor TSC-22
acts has remained unclear, and the functional analysis of
TSC-22 is hampered because of redundancy and various
possible interactions among the homologous TSC22DF
proteins. In a previous study, we showed that the
Drosophila long class TSC22DF isoforms are positive
growth regulators. Here, we report that the long human
TSC22DF isoforms are able to substitute for BunA
function when expressed in the fly. To illuminate the
mechanism by which long TSC22DF isoforms promote
growth, we searched for BunA binding partners. A
combined proteomic and genetic analysis identified the
adapter protein Madm. Drosophila Madm is a positive
growth regulator that increases organ growth when
co-overexpressed with BunA. We propose that the BunAMadm growth-promoting complex is functionally con­
served from flies to humans.
Materials and methods
Breeding conditions and fly stocks

Flies were kept at 25°C on food described in [53]. For the
rescue experiment bun200B [12], UAS-bunA [31], armGal4, da-Gal4, and Act5C-Gal4 (Bloomington Drosophila
Stock Center), and vas-φC31-zh2A; ZH-attP-86Fb [35]
flies were used. For the genetic mosaic screen, y, w,
eyFLP; FRT82B, w+, cl3R3/TM6B, Tb, Hu flies [54] were
used. Clonal analyses in adult eyes were carried out with
y, w, hsFLP; FRT82B, w+, M/TM6B, Tb, Hu, y+. For rescue
experiments, allelic series, and the analysis of hypo­
morphic mutant Madm flies, Df(3R)Exel7283 (Blooming­
ton Drosophila Stock Center) was used. In hypomorphic
bunA flies displaying wing notches, the alleles bunA-P519L
[12] and bunrI043 [31] were combined. Madm, bunA
double-mutant mosaic heads were generated with y, w,
eyFLP; FRT40A, w+, cl2L3/CyO; FRT82B, w+, cl3R3/TM6B,
Tb, Hu [54] flies, bun allele A-Q578X [12], the UAS

hairpin line 19679 (RNAi bun) [55], and ey-Gal4 [56].
The overexpression studies in the eye and wing were done
with GMR-Gal4 [57] and C10-Gal4 [58], UAS-eGFP, and
UAS-lacZ (Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center).
Generation of transgenic flies

bunA cDNA was subcloned from a UAS-bunA plasmid
[31] into the pUAST-attB vector [35] using EcoRI sites.
The bunA ORF was PCR-amplified from a UAS-bunA
plasmid [31], cloned into the pENTR-D/TOPO vector
(Invitrogen) and subcloned into a Gateway-compatible
pUAST-attB vector (J Bischof, Institute of Molecular
Biology, University of Zurich; unpublished work) by
clonase reaction (LR clonase II enzyme).
The human ORFs TSC22D1.1, TSC22D1.2, TSC22D3v1-3
and TSC22D4 were derived from the cDNA of a normal
prostate tissue sample. This sample was derived from a
radical prostatectomy specimen at the Department of
Urology, University of Berne as described previously [4].
The ORF TSC22D2 was derived from the pOTB7 vector
carrying the TSC22D2 full-length cDNA (Open Bio­
systems, clone ID 5454441). ORFs were PCR-amplified,
cloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega) and
subsequently cloned into the pcDNA3.1/Hygro(+) vector
(Invitrogen). The ORFs TSC22D1.1 and TSC22D2 were
subcloned from pGEM-T Easy to pUAST-attB using
EcoRI. The ORF TSC22D1.2 was subcloned from
pcDNA3.1/Hygro(+) to the pBluescript II KS(+/-) vector
using HindIII and XhoI, then further subcloned into the
pUAST vector [34] using EcoRI and XhoI, and finally
cloned into the pUAST-attB vector with EcoRI and XbaI.
The ORFs TSC22D3v1-3 and TSC22D4 were PCRamplified from cDNA-containing pGEM-T Easy plasmids
and cloned into pUAST-attB using EcoRI and NotI (restric­
tion sites added by PCR). The pUAST-attB plasmids were
injected into vas-φC31-zh2A; ZH-attP-86Fb embryos [35].
Madm cDNA was cleaved by EcoRI and HindIII double
digestion from expressed sequence tag (EST) clone
LD28567 (Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project) and
subcloned into pUAST using the same restriction sites to
generate the UAS-Madm construct. Madm genomic
DNA (from 559 bp upstream of Madm exon 1 (containing
exon 1 of the neighboring gene CG2097) to 1,681 bp
downstream of Madm exon 2) was amplified by PCR
using forward primer GCT­CTA­GAA­G GC­GAT­G CG­
ATG­ACCAGCTC and reverse primer GAG­ATC­TTC­
ATG­ACGTTTTCCGCGCACTCGAGT. The PCR product
was digested with BglII and XbaI and subcloned into the
transformation vector pCaspeR.
Gateway cloning for Drosophila cell culture and yeast
two‑hybrid assays

The complete and partial ORFs of bunA and Madm were
PCR-amplified from a pUAST-bunA [31] and a UAS-Madm

Gluderer et al. Journal of Biology 2010, 9:9
http://jbiol.com/content/9/1/9

plasmid, respectively, and cloned into the pENTR/DTOPO vector. The point mutations in pENTR-D/TOPObunA and -Madm were introduced by substitution of a
BamHI/DraI and an FspI/SacI fragment that was PCRamplified using mutated primers. By clonase reaction (LR
clonase II) the inserts were transferred to the following
destination vectors: pMT-HHW-Blast (O Rinner, IMSB,
ETH Zurich, unpublished work), pMT-GW-Blast,
pDEST22, and pDEST32. Additionally, the GFP ORF was
cloned into the pMT-HHW-Blast vector, leading to the
production of HA-tagged GFP as a negative control for
co-IP experiments. The pMT-HHW-Blast vector is based
on the pMT-V5HisA vector (Invitrogen) carrying a
metallothionein-inducible promoter. The multiple
cloning site and tag sequences were replaced by the
Gateway cassette, including the coding sequence for a
triple HA-tag from the pAHW destination vector
(Invitro­gen). The blasticidin-resistance cassette was
cloned from the pCoBlast vector (Invitrogen) into the
pMT-V5HisA vector backbone. The pMT-HHW-Blast
vector was modified by exchanging an AgeI/EcoRI
fragment containing the GFP coding region derived from
the pAGW destination vector.
Cell culture conditions and cell transfections

Drosophila embryonic S2 cells were grown at 25°C in
Schneider’s Drosophila medium (Gibco/Invitrogen)
supple­mented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum
(FCS), as well as penicillin and streptomycin. S2 cells
were transfected according to the Effectene transfection
protocol for adherent cells (Qiagen). To generate stable
cell lines, transfected S2 cells were selected for 14-30 days
in Schneider’s medium containing 25 μg/ml blasticidin
and afterwards propagated in Schneider’s medium
containing 10 μg/ml blasticidin.
Pulldown experiments analyzed by LC-MS/MS

Before affinity purification, Drosophila S2 cells were
grown in shaking flasks. Bait expression was induced by
600 μM CuSO4 for at least 16 h. For affinity purification
the cell pellets were lysed on ice for 30 minutes in 10 ml
HNN (50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 5 mM EDTA, 250 mM
NaCl, 0.5% NP40, 1 mM PMSF, 50 mM NaF, 1.5 mM
Na3VO4, protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche)) in the
presence of 3 mM dithiobis-(succinimidyl propionate)
(DSP) with ten strokes using a tight-fitting Dounce
homogenizer. Reactive DSP was quenched by adding 1 ml
Tris pH 7.5. Insoluble material was removed by centrifu­
gation and the supernatant was precleared using 100 μl
Protein A-Sepharose (Sigma) for 1 h at 4°C on a rotating
shaker. After removal of the Protein A-Sepharose, 100 μl
Agarose anti-GFP beads (MB-0732) or Agarose mono­
clonal mouse anti-HA beads (Sigma A2095) were added
to the extracts and incubated for 4 h at 4°C on a rotating

Page 11 of 15

shaker. Immunoprecipitates were washed four times with
20 bed volumes of lysis buffer and three times with
20 bed volumes of buffer without detergent and protease
inhibitor. The proteins were released from the beads by
adding three times 150 μl 0.2 M glycine pH 2.5. Following
neutralization with 100 μl 1 M NH4CO3, the eluates were
treated with 5 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP)
to reduce S-S bonds and DSP crosslinkers for 30 minutes
at 37°C, and alkylated with 10 mM iodoacetamide for
30 minutes at room temperature in the dark. For tryptic
digestion, 1 μg trypsin was added to the eluate and
incubated at 37°C overnight.
Nanoflow-LC-MS/MS was performed by coupling an
UltiMate HPLC system (LC-Packings/Dionex) in-line
with a Probot (LC-Packings/Dionex) autosampler system
and an LTQ ion trap (Thermo Electron). Samples were
automatically injected into a 10-μl sample-loop and
loaded onto an analytical column (9 cm × 75 μm; packed
with Magic C18 AQ beads 5 μm, 100 Å (Michrom
BioResources)). Peptide mixtures were delivered to the
analytical column at a flow rate of 300 nl/minute of buffer
A (5% acetonitrile, 0.2% formic acid) for 25 minutes and
then eluted using a gradient of acetonitrile (10-45%;
0.5%/minutes) in 0.2% formic acid. Peptide ions were
detected in a survey scan from 400 to 2,000 atomic mass
units (amu; one to two μscans) followed by three to six
data-dependent MS/MS scans (three μscans each, isola­
tion width 2 amu, dynamic exclusion list 250, dynamic
exclusion time 240 sec, two repeats) in an automated
fashion. Following analysis, raw MS/MS data were
converted to Mascot generic format (MGF) files that
were used to identify the corresponding peptides using
the Mascot database search tool (MatrixScience) [59,60].
MS/MS spectra were searched against the Drosophila
protein database (dmel_r5.18_FB2009_05 released
20090529) [60] with the following criteria: requirement
for trypsin digestion; peptide mass tolerance 2 Da;
fragment mass tolerance 0.6 Da; missed cleavage for
trypsin 3; fixed modification carbamidomethyl (C);
variable modifications acetyl (N-term), oxidation (M),
CAM-thiopropanoyl (K) (derived from DSP crosslinker).
All peptide assignments with Mascot ion score larger
than the homology score and with Mascot expect score
smaller than 0.05 (significant ion score) were considered
as good hits.
Co-localization studies

For immunofluorescence Drosophila S2 cells were
stimu­lated for 4 h with 600 μM CuSO4 and spread on
concanavalin-A-treated slides and fixed with 4% para­
formaldehyde. Mouse anti-HA (1:200, Roche 166606),
rabbit anti-GMAP210 (1:200) [38], goat anti-mouse Cy3
(1:200, Amersham PA43002) and goat anti-rabbit Cy3
(1:200, Amersham PA43004) antibodies were used.

Nuclei were visualized by DAPI (100 ng/ml) staining.
For imaging, a Leica TCS SPE confocal microscope was
used.
Statistical analysis of the dependence of HA-Madm
localization on GFP-BunA was carried out in S2 cells
transiently transfected two days before analysis. Cells
were co-transfected with pMT-HA-Madm or pMT-HAMadm(R525H) and with either empty pMT-GW-Blast
(for control GFP expression) or with pMT-GFP-bunA.
Fifty cells were analyzed for each combination. The
expressed HA-Madm and HA-Madm(R525H) proteins
showed a similar diffuse localization in the cytoplasm of
cells strongly expressing GFP (50 out of 50 each). By
contrast, HA-Madm localized to dots (punctae) in cells
displaying a readily detectable GFP-BunA signal (50 out
of 50). In 17 out of 50 cells, GFP-BunA directed
HA-Madm(R525H) localization in punctae.
GPF-tagged versions of BunA and Madm

To generate flies expressing amino-terminally GFPtagged versions of BunA and Madm, the respective ORFs
were subcloned by clonase reaction from pENTR/DTOPO to pUAST-GW-AttB (the Gateway-compatible
pUAST-AttB vector was provided by I Pörnbacher, IMSB,
ETH Zurich; unpublished work). The plasmid containing
bunA was injected into vas-φC31-zh2A; ZH-attP-86Fb
embryos [35], and the Madm-containing plasmid into
vas-φC31-zh2A; ZH-attP-51D embryos [35]. Leaky
expression of UAS-GFP-bunA was sufficient to completely
rescue the lethality of bun200B/200B mutants. Expression of
UAS-GFP-Madm under the control of the arm-Gal4
driver line resulted in a rescue (approximately 50% of the
expected Mendelian ratio) of the lethality of Madm3Y2/
Df(3R)Exel7283 animals.
Co-immunoprecipitation and western blotting

Stable Drosophila S2 cell lines capable of producing GFP
(negative control) or GFP-tagged Bun versions were
transiently transfected with HA-Madm plasmids. Two
days after transient transfection, confluent Drosophila S2
cells (2.3 ml corresponding to one well of a 6-well-plate)
were induced for 4 h with CuSO4 (600 μM), harvested,
and washed with PBS. Cells were lysed in IP buffer (120
mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 20 mM NaF, 1 mM
benzamidine, 1 mM EDTA, 6 mM EGTA, 15 mM
Na4P2O7, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1x Complete Mini Protease
Inihibitor (Roche)). After incubation for 15 minutes on
an orbital shaker at 4°C, solubilized material was
recovered by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 15 minutes
and supernatants were collected. Cell lysates were incu­
bated for 4 h at 4°C under rotation either with 20 μl
Agarose anti-GFP beads (MB-0732) or Agarose mono­
clonal mouse anti-HA beads (Sigma A2095) that had
been equilibrated with IP buffer. Beads were then washed

Page 12 of 15

five times with IP buffer and boiled for 5 minutes at 95°C
in Laemmli buffer. Proteins contained in the supernatant
were separated by SDS-PAGE. For western blotting, the
Hybond ECL Nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham), the
ECL detection reagent (Amersham), and the following
antibodies were used: rabbit anti-Bun (1:1,000) [33],
rabbit anti-BunA (1:2,000), mouse anti-HA (1:3,000, Roche
166606), monoclonal mouse anti-GFP (1:1,000, Roche 11
814 460 001), monoclonal mouse anti-rabbit horseradish
peroxidase (HRP) (1:10,000, Jackson Lab), sheep antimouse HRP (1:10,000, Amersham NA931).
The rabbit anti-BunA antibody was generated using the
following peptide to immunize rabbits: H2NTNRKPKTTSSFEC-CONH2 (Eurogentec). The serum
was double-affinity purified against the peptide coupled
to a column. Specificity of the antibody was shown by
western blotting: Drosophila S2 cells were incubated for
2  days with dsRNA [61] that targets either the ORF of
bunA (500 bp long dsRNA) or of GFP as a control (700 bp
long dsRNA). Primer sequences are available on request.
Yeast two-hybrid experiments

For the Y2H experiments the Gateway-compatible
ProQuest Two-Hybrid System (Invitrogen) including the
pDEST32 and pDEST22 vectors was used. Trans­for­
mation of a MaV203 strain was achieved with the LiAc/
SS carrier DNA/polyethylene glycol (PEG) method. To
identify interactions, yeast cells were tested for HIS3
reporter gene expression under the control of the HIS
promoter. The competitive inhibitor 3-amino-1,2,4triazole (3-AT) was used to dampen leaky expression.
The 3-AT concentration needed to restrain leakiness was
determined to be 10 mM by almost suppressing the
growth of negative control strains that have been
transformed with an empty pDEST22 and/or pDEST32
vector (every combination of negative controls was
examined). For each interaction to be tested, five yeast
colonies were pooled and grown overnight in -Leu -Trp
medium. Seven microliters of dilutions of OD600 = 0.1,
0.01, and 0.001 with double-distilled H2O were spotted
on -Leu -Trp -His +3-AT (10 mM) plates and incubated
for 52-56 h at 30°C. As a control for a correct dilution
series they were also spotted on -Leu -Trp -His plates
without 3-AT (data not shown).
eyFLP/FRT screen, mapping of EMS mutations, and rescue
experiments

The eyFLP/FRT technique [54] was used to produce
mosaic flies with eyes and head capsules largely homo­zy­
gous for randomly induced mutations. The rest of the
body (including the germline) remained heterozygous
and was therefore phenotypically wild type (screen
described in [41]). The seven EMS alleles of a comple­
men­tation group on 3R were mapped using visible

Gluderer et al. Journal of Biology 2010, 9:9
http://jbiol.com/content/9/1/9

markers (P-elements) to the cytological region 83-84.
With deletions that failed to complement the lethality of
EMS alleles (Df(3R)ED5196, Df(3R)ED5197, Df(3R)
Exel7283, and Df(3R)Exel6145) the candidate region was
narrowed down to the cytological interval 83C1-4. The
EP-element EP3137 inserted in the 5’ untranslated region
of the Madm locus failed to complement the lethality of
the EMS alleles.
The UAS/Gal4 system [34] was used to test whether
ubiquitous expression of a UAS-Madm construct during
development - achieved by the arm-Gal4, da-Gal4, and
Act5C-Gal4 driver lines - rescued the recessive lethality
of the EMS alleles. Using arm-Gal4, the viability of
combinations of EMS alleles (2U3, 3G5, 3Y2, and 7L2)
with the deletion Df(3R)Exel7283 was completely
restored and the lethality of heteroallelic combinations
among EMS alleles was partially rescued. One copy of a
genomic Madm rescue construct (LCQ139) - comprising
559 bp of the upstream region, the two Madm exons and
the intron, and 1,681 bp of downstream sequences - was
sufficient to entirely rescue the lethality of heteroallelic
combinations of EMS alleles (2U3 and 3G5) and of the
hemizygous alleles (tested with the deficiency Df(3R)
Exel7283). In addition, the pinhead phenotypes of the
EMS alleles 2U3 and 3G5 were reverted by one copy of
the genomic construct.
Determination of allelic series

Animals were reared on apple agar plates supplemented
with yeast at 25°C. Allelic series was determined by
crossing Madm EMS alleles (y, w; FRT82B, Madm-/
TM6B, Tb, Hu) to a defi­ciency (y, w; Df(3R)Exel7283/
TM6B, Tb, Hu) uncovering the entire Madm locus. In
addition, the development of Madm2U3/3G5 and
Madm3Y2/7L2 animals was compared with the development
of Madm2U3 or 3G5/Df(3R)Exel7283 and Madm3Y2 or 7L2/
Df(3R)Exel7283 animals, respectively. Heteroallelic
combinations of the Madm EMS alleles, except for 3T4,
resulted in larval phenotypes that were as strong as the
phenotypes caused in the hemizygous condition.
Analysis of adult flies

Clones in the adult eyes were induced 24-48 h after egg
deposition (AED) by a heat shock for 1 h at 34°C in
animals of the genotype y, w, hsFLP/y, w; FRT82B, w+,
M/ FRT82B, Madm-. Adult fly heads were halved using
a razor blade and stored up to 1 h in Ringer’s solution
on ice. Eyes were then fixed and processed as described
in [62]. Pictures were taken with a Zeiss Axiophot
micro­scope. In tangential eye sections, the areas
enclosed by rhabdomeres and cell bodies from
photoreceptors R1-R6 were measured in mutant
ommatidia (lacking pigmenta­tion) and in neighboring
wild-type sized (pigmented) ommatidia using Adobe

Page 13 of 15

Photoshop. Student’s t-test was used to determine
significance.
For the analysis of the ommatidia number in mosaic
eyes and the analysis of ommatidia size in overexpression
studies, flies were frozen at -20°C before taking SEM
pictures. All ommatidia were counted and the area of
seven adjacent ommatidia (rosette) in the center was
measured using Adobe Photoshop.
Freshly eclosed hypomorphic mutant Madm flies were
kept on fresh food for 2 days. Flies were exposed to 95°C
for 5 minutes and air-dried at room temperature for 3
days. The dry weight of individual flies was determined
with a Mettler Toledo MX5 microbalance. Significance
was assessed using Student’s t-test.
Adult wings were mounted in Euparal after dehydration
in 70% and subsequently 100% ethanol. Pictures were
taken with a Zeiss Axiophot microscope. Significance
was assessed using Student’s t-test.
For the overexpression studies, a set of Gal4 driver lines
was crossed to a UAS-Madm transgenic line. No obvious
phenotypes were observed using arm-Gal4, da-Gal4,
ppl-Gal4, and sev-Gal4. Ubiquitous overexpression
achieved with Act5C-Gal4 resulted in lethality. Expres­
sion in the dorsal compartment of the developing wing
(ap-Gal4) led to deformed wings. MS1096-Gal4 directed
expression in the developing wing produced vein defects
and blisters in the adult wing. Expression of Madm
during early eye development (ey-Gal4) produced
pattern­ing defects (rough and small adult eyes) whereas
Madm expression later during eye development (GMRGal4) produced growth phenotypes when co-over­
expressed with UAS-bunA.
