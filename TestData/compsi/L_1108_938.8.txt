Abstract - The need for the protocols is increasing day by day as the protocols are becoming an important part of the network based computing.
Protocols are basically some set of rules defined for communication through which the network devices communicate with each other and
exchange information with each other. The protocols have been divided into different categories depending upon their functionality and usage.
There are wide varieties of protocols that currently exist which have been defined by some network based standard throughout the world. This
research paper presents a critical review of existing protocols with their functionalities usage and applications. This research paper points out the
limitations and variations in existing protocols and guides about the feasible methods to administer the issues.
Keywords – Computer Networks; Wireless Networks; Network Protocols; Network Layers; Network Topologies

I. INTRODUCTION
Networking is a very wide and complicated field that we
cannot exactly define its origin. But we can say that concept
of the networking was first time introduced in 1960s. In
1960s the networking was identical to the mainframe
computing and the telephonic services and also at that time
there was no division between the local area and the wide
area networks. Later on the work on the first network of the
history of networking the ARPANET began in the 1960s, and
later on in the year 1969 a four-node networking network
using primitive packet switching was created.
In the 1960 the mainframe technology was used, later
1970 was the era of Ethernet technology. Ethernet was
published in 1980. Similarly the Xerox networking system
was introduced known as X-wire was named after the
Xerox’s researcher and it was able to work at 2.94 Mbps
speed.
In the era of 1980, there was a wide increase in the use of
client/server environment while the mainframe computing
environments had got a decline. Similarly in 1985 a large
number of UNIX machines and LANS were connected to the
APRANET. Later on a lot many more developments were
made in the field of the networking and still a lot of
developments are made in the networking technology [1].
A network basically consists of system of computers,
terminals and the databases connected together by means of
communication lines. Networking is a process through which
two or more devices communicate with each other to share
the data and also to share resources with each other. As
shown in the following figure:

Protocols are basically some set of rules defined for
communication through which the network devices
communicate with each other and exchange information with
each other. The protocols of humans are for speaking,
listening, appearance and for the communication purpose.
This set of communication is called protocols of human
communications or conversation. A network protocol is a set
of rules must be followed by the two of the communication
devices in order to talk with each other.
A network protocol is formally defined as an agreed upon
set-up for the transmission between the two devices. A
network protocol determines the following:
Data formats for the data exchange of the data.
Detection for the transmission errors because no network is
error-free.

Acknowledgement for the correct transfers of the packets
of data by receiver are used to tell the sender that
retransmission of data is not needed.
Loss of the data. Sometimes the packets of the data are lost
on the network or may suffer with delay.

TCP/IP communication is basically point to point. TCP/IP
uses the client server environment for the communication
purpose in the network [5].

Designing of the protocols is done using different
software tools. The communication system always operates
parallel. Tools of programming and the techniques used for
dealing with parallel processes are called as "concurrency of
programming". This type of programming is an important
concept in the operating systems theories. Mathematical
approach for the studying of communication and concurrency
referred as the use of finite machines. This type is a bit
challenge for usage so therefore all of the things must be kept
simple. Basis for the protocol design is the internet protocol.
For the
cooperation purpose the protocols need to
communicate with one and other, for this a framework is
required.
Serial communications in-order to take place properly,
many functions has to be made possible for that. First
requirement is that, the receiver and the sender computers
must be made in such away so that they can control their
actions also can enable the flow control of the data [2], [3].
The process of the addressing helps to send the data packets to
the desired location. Lastly the management of connection is a
set of functions that are linked with the maintenance of the
connection. The receiver must know everything related to the
data packet that is being transmitted.
Figure.2 Network Layers and Used Protocols

II. TYPES OF PROTOCOLS
There are different types of the protocols that are
commonly used and some are yet to be developed for the
future usage. Some of the protocols that are commonly used
are:
A. TCP/IP PROTOCOL
This protocol is collection of different set of protocol
suites .TCP/IP was used to give birth to global internet.
TCP/IP name has been made out of two core protocols TCP
and IP [4]. Other core protocols in this suite are UDP and
ICMP all these protocols work in a collective manner to
attain similar goals but in a different way it is not only used
on the internet but they are also extensively used to construct
private networks with in a organization like “intranets”. TCP
and IP were made by the United States military to let two or
more computing communicate to each other at long distances
[4], [5]. IP has the responsibility to transfer packets of data
between two computing devices whereas TCP has the
responsibility of authentic delivery from any server to its
clients [5].TCP/IP is constructed in a way that that it provides
a base for the internet as it is been inherent in every existing
modern systems as well as UNIX, MAC and
WINDOWS.TCP/IP is a two layered program. The higher or
the upper layer is the TCP which assembles the messages or
the files into small packets of the data that are sent on the
internet and are received by the upper layer which than
retransform the data packets into original message [6]. The
second or the lower layer is the IP layer, which handles
address part of each of the data packets so that it is sent to its
right place. A gateway between the networks checks all the
addresses to check where the message is to be sent. The

FUNCTIONS OF TCP/IP:
A.

Multiplexing and Addressing:

One of the main functions of the TCP/IP is to perform the
multiplexing/addressing. The data is received from many
processes so that it can be sent through the network protocol
layer. Also all of the high level application processes are
managed through the TCP ports.

TCP/IP takes little
time in-order to
ensure consistency.

In UDP the

not
compulsory.

Assurance of
message
deliverance

TCP/IP sends
acknowledgement
when the packet of
data is received.

UDP cannot
tell whether
data is correct
sent or not.

Packet
sequence

The data packets are
transmitted in
proper order.

Data packets
are not send
properly in
order.

TCP/IP provides a set of rules that all of the devices must
follow in-order to begin and also settle a TCP/IP connection
through which the data can be sent. TCP/IP includes some
reasons for management of connection and also controlling
of problems that may occur. When a device gets TCP /IP
connection, some a particular procedure is used in-order to
stop the connection.
C.

Data Packages and their Handling:

The TCP/IP sets a procedure through which all of the
applications can send the data to the TCP/IP. Data is coded
into messages that are to be sent to the receiver which is the
TCP/IP software. The Receiving software un-codes the data
and sends it to the required application which is on the
receiving machine.
D.

Figure.3 Shows Data Transmission in TCP Protocol

Transfer of Data:
B. USER DATAGRAM PROTOCOL (UDP):

TCP/IP execution on a transmitting device is answerable
for the transfer of data packets to the TCP/IP process which
is on another device. It follows the procedure of layering
which is done by using
the TCP/IP software on the
receiving machine which than sends data packets to the
network-layer protocol that is the Internet Protocol.
ADVANTAGES OF TCP/IP PROTOCOL:
TCP/IP is used to set up connections between different
types of servers and computers.
TCP/IP is an open and also industry standard protocol.
It is operated separately without the interference of
operating system.
It also supports the routing protocols.
Sets up internal networking between the different
organizations.
DISADVANTAGES OF TCP/IP:
TCP/IP protocol is much slower than IPX.
It is very much complex in-order to administer and
establish.

UDP is a protocol which does not require any type of
connections. UDP
helps to do the host to host
communication.UDP (User Datagram Protocol) in the OSI
model belongs to the transport layer .The services UDP
provides or unpredictable, no assure about delivery and
defense against recurrence.UDP offers a negligible ,un
trusted but on the other hand offers a more trusted n best
messaging transporting service to the applications this
protocol is for communication purpose and it provides
restricted number of services when messages or the data is
exchanged or send between two or more computers within
the network. UDP can be deployed where TCP is already
deployed but as TCP assures about the reliability, sequence
of data transferred it does not. Data -grams can go missing
without any notifications. UDP collectively with IP is also
called as UDP/IP. The application program which uses UDP
must make clear that the message has reached in the
correct order. Network applications which have small data
packets for exchange and also all those which want to save
the time required for the processing of data do prefer to use
the UDP protocol instead of TCP.

ADVANTAGES OF UDP:
Over head in UDP is less.
Transmission of the data is fast.
UDP is very much useful in the applications that don’t
require any data fragment.
DISADVANTAGES OF UDP:
There is no guarantee that data is properly delivered or not
also data may get lost and may not be resent.
In UDP there is no proper ordering of data packets.
C. HYPER TEXT TRANSFER PROTOCOL (HTTP)
Figure.4 Flow of Data in TCP and UDP

FUNCTIONS OF UDP:
A.

Wireless Services:

In UDP no connection is required for transmission of data
packets; it provides wireless services for the data packets
transfer throughout the whole network. This means every
datagram sent by the UDP is an autonomous datagram. There
is no connection between any datagram being sent to the
receiver even though they are sent by the same source
program.
UDP does not establish any connection as already known
and also it does not establish ant termination connection as
TCP does so in reaction any datagram can travel on any path.
Due to its wireless service it sends short messages which are
sliced down to different related user datagram by UDP.
B.

HTTP is the protocol which is mainly used by the web
servers. HTTP tells how to format and transmit the messages
and what procedures to be used by the internet browsers and
all the Web servers for various actions to be performed.
HTTP is also known as stateless protocol because all of the
commands and actions are performed independently. It gives
the users a set of rules for exchange of the data. HTTP is
same like FTP. But on the other hand it is rather more similar
than the FTP for it only uses one TCP connection. The reason
of similarity between HTTP and SMTP is due to the data that
is being transmitted between users and sever. As SMTP
messages are not human readable so are the HTTP messages.
These messages are only interpretable by HTTP server and
its client i.e. (browsers). The commands sent by the user to
the server are in the embedded format of a request message.
The contents of the requested file are in embedded format of
a response message.

Flow control:

UDP doesn’t provide any flow control of data packets in
the network the receiver may overflow with incoming
messages.. Data is randomly sent without any sequence and
there is no option or service to re-transmit the data if it is not
sent due to any error or any other reason. Whenever the user
notices an error through the checksum, user datagram is
mutely removed or deleted.
C.

Operation of Queuing:

When a process is started an incoming and outgoing
queue is associated with each process by the client and is
differentiated by port ephemeral number of each process.
Whenever a process is terminated the queue associated with
that process is also terminated. UDP always checks whether
an incoming queue for the port number of user is created or
that otherwise the UDP discards that datagram of the user.

HTTP FUNCTIONS:

In HTTP protocol there is no security mechanisms.

Functions of HTTP are the combination of FTP and SMTP.
Table-2: Functions of HTTP

Figure.7 HTTP and TCP Protocol

D. FILE TRANSFER PROTOCOL (FTP):
FTP stands for File Transfer Protocol; it is particularly
used for the exchange of files or information on the internet.
It uses the TCP/IP protocol to enable the data transfer on the
internet. It is particularly used for uploading a file on the
server using the internet or for downloading the files from the
main computer by using the internet. Even the file
transferring from one system to other system appears too
easy but difficulties related to the functionality of FTP do
come. For example the two system or the host who are
exchanging or transferring files also these two systems can
have a separate conduct to embody the data. All these above
stated problems are solved in an easy and an elegant
approach by the FTP.
The FTP protocol is different from the normal server and
the user applications as this makes two handshakes between
the servers. One handshake is the connection establishment
which is used for data transmission.

Figure.6 HTTP Based Handshaking

ADVANTAGES OF HTTP:
HTTP is connectionless protocol.
HTTP not depends on media for data transmission.
In HTTP both the user and the server are well aware of
each other.
DISADVANTAGES OF HTTP:
HTTP is a stainless protocol.

FTP FUNCTIONS:
FTTP functions as both server and the client in the
internet or the network.
A.

Functions as Server:

The FTP server provides you the services that can be used
by us to install files on the server, manage all of the files and
download the files easily from the server when we require
them.
B.

Functions as Client:

The FTP client helps us to connect with the server of the
FTP on the port, so we can upload, download, delete, change
settings related to the files and also rename the files easily.
FTP ADVANTAGES:
Figure.9 Ethernet Protocol Working

File transfer protocol is the fastest protocol for
downloading of large files.
It's a very efficient protocol as it doesn’t require us to end
many tasks in-order to transfer the file or files.
FTP servers require a username and password.
FTP enables us to transfer files forth and back.
FTP DISADVANTAGES:
File contents and the passwords are sending in the form of
clear text, which allow some unwanted eavesdropping.
Its quiet difficult to filter the active mode of the FTP traffic
on the client using the firewall settings.
In FTP it is possible for us to send the data on a random
port of the any other computer.
E. ETHERNET:
This protocol is a part of structured based computer
networking technologies and is used in local area networks.
Ethernet protocol is most extensively used protocol. Ethernet
requires the twisted pair wires or coaxial cables for the
establishment of connection. This protocol is a cheap fast
speed local area network used now days. Ethernet has
replaced many other LANs due to its speed.

Figure Courtesy
http://www.hms.se/images/eip_overview.png
Ethernet is standard IEEE 802.3 protocol, which is made
up of combination of the twisted paired wires and are used to
connect or make them part of the network. Ethernet uses the
bus or the star topology for the data transmission in the
network. This protocol explains the lower two layers of the
OSI model. There are two media access controls present in
the Ethernet the half duplex and the full duplex.
FUNCTIONS OF ETHERNET:
Ethernet is a networking protocol used for local networks
Ethernet tells about the wiring necessary to be used for the
frame formats and for the protocols.
It also makes the computers to communicate by connecting
them all together.
ADVANTAGES OF ETHERNET:
Multiple computers can be connected together using the
Ethernet protocol.
It is quite faster to transfer large data packets and large
files on the network without any delay.
It’s very easy to install the Ethernet.
DISADVANTAGES OF ETHERNET:
In Ethernet for connecting to the internet you need hub.
Very difficult for us to install the Ethernet connection on
two or more computers that are within the network.
Difficult to establish internet for two or more computers
using the Ethernet.
F. POINT TO POINT PROTOCOL (PPP)

Maham Rabbani et al, International Journal of Advanced Research in Computer Science, 2 (2), Mar-Apr, 2011,40-48

Point-to-Point Protocol is mostly used for establishing a
direct linking among two nodes (servers, computers). PPP is
also able to link computers through telephones, phone lines,
cables, fiber optics etc. Many of the Internet Service Provider
(ISP) uses the PPP for the customer’s dial-up connection to
access the internet. Point –To-point was planned to be
designed in such manner that it can enable the
communication of many different protocols over one pointto-point connection by using the technique or process of
encapsulation. Encapsulation is a technique through which
packets are stored from various types of protocols present
within the Point-to-Point frames. PPP is able of working
transversely with every type of interfaces. It does not impose
any type of limit regarding transmission rate.

The data in the IP network is in the form of packets. .
Every IP data packet contains a header which contains source
and destination addresses and also other information about
the packet of the data and it also contains the message data
itself and also each packet of the data is processed separately.
The TCP/IP protocol is basically used as communication
medium for the transportation of the IP data packets over the
network. The IP protocol is most widely used.
TYPES OF IP PROTOCOL:
There are two main types of IP protocol including IPV4
and IPV6.
Table.III IPV4 and IPV6

Figure.10 Point-To-Point Protocol (PPP) Working

FUNCTIONS OF POINT-TO-POINT:
It is designed in-order to transport multiple protocol data
packets between two or more computers linked through
easy connections.
The links of PPP provide full duplex bi-directional
operations.
ADVANTAGES OF POINT-TO-POINT PROTOCOL:
One of the main advantages of PPP is that it is extensible
protocol suite.
It is can do operations in any type of interfaces.
There is no restriction related to transmission rate in the
point –to-point protocol.
DISADVANTAGES OF POINT-TO-POINT
PROTOCOL:
This protocol is not very much reliable for data
transmission at large scale.
Figure.11 IP Protocol

G. INTERNET PROTOCOL (IP):
IP is an important
network protocol which is being
used by the internet providers. The protocol was launched in
1970s. it is very important protocol of the internet and the
networking and is very much used. Internet Protocol is
basically a set of technical rules which tell that how the
computers interact with each other over the network. IP
functions as the networking layer of the internet.

Functions of the IP:
46

Maham Rabbani et al, International Journal of Advanced Research in Computer Science, 2 (2), Mar-Apr, 2011,40-48

Addressing:
IP data packet header include the addresses of the
sending and the receiving computers. The routing devices
use this data for guiding each of the data packet across the
communication networks and also connect the sender and
receiver.
FRAGMENTATION:
The IP data packets are fragmented, into smaller packets.
This does not allow a larger data packet to move over the
entire network which is capable to handle only smaller data
packets. IP fragments the data packets and reassembles all of
the data packets.
TIME OUT:
In the IP protocol each data packet is allocated a time slot
to travel or move across the network. When this time slot
gets expired than that data packet is discarded.
Figure.12 WI-MAX Protocol

ADVANTAGES OF IP:
1. The IP provides
information related to the clients
/servers that can access the Internet.
2. IP checks the addressing of the data packets or the
message so that it is sent to the right destination.
3. This protocol is capable of handling the errors.

WORKING OF WI-MAX:
Wi-MAX working requires following two things [7]:

DISADVANATGES OF IP:
Wi-MAX Base Station:
1. The data packets are not sent in proper order.
2. The packet is divided into number of different small
packets.
3. Data packet is lost if time gets expired.
H. WI-MAX PROTOCOL:
In mid 1990s different communication companies decided
to introduce an approach to use wire-less networks for the
communication purpose so that it is possible to send and
receive the data at a larger distance without the use of cables,
wires etc. so in this way many different wireless technologies
were introduced and in the last wi-max or wi-fi was
introduced in 2001. Later on much advancement was made in
the Wi-max and its speed as well as quality was enhanced.
Wi-max is integrated as the 3G technology used now-days.

The base station consists of electronics which are used indoor also it requires a Wi-MAX tower for the connection.
Base station is capable of covering up to 10 km radius. If
wireless node is present within that coverage area it can
access the internet [8].
Wi-MAX receiver:
Both the antenna and the receiver can be a box or wimax card that is used to access the internet. Wi-MAX has a
base station which is similar to that of the Wireless Access
Point present in the Wi-Fi network, but the range of the wimax is more.

Wi-max is an IP based protocol which performs a similar
to the IEEE 802.11. Wimax is standard protocol used now
days. The data transmission using the Wi-MAX is very much
easy because it does not require any cables or wires for the
transmission of the data rather it uses waves for the
transmission of data. For accessing of internet using the wi-fi
technology we do not need any cable or wire. Different wi-fi
technologies are used now a day for accessing the internet
like wi-fi cards which are capable to catch the signals from
the antenna.

The application of networking value added networks
which can be public or private give a leased connection
to all of their clients [9], [10].
Due to networking the Automated ATM machines allow
customers to access their accounts and to do transactions
from any corner of the world
IV. CONCLUSION
This research paper is basically about the network
protocols. It enables the reader to know about all of the
important networking protocols, how these protocols
function and all other information which is very much
necessary for the protocols. The paper is providing an
analysis of all the core protocols of the networking. The
different design and application oriented characteristics of
different protocoles have been disscussed in detail. The
working flow of each of these protocoles have also been
explained with the help of internal working concepts.

Advantages of Wi-max:
An important advantage of wi-max is that it is completely
wi-free i.e. it does not require any wiring or cables.
Wi-max supports roaming i.e. it can be accessed from any
where.
It has contains a global standard i.e. the user can access the
internet from any where.

[2]

[3]

Disadvantages of Wi-max:
One of the main disadvantages is the problem of security
in the wi-max.
Wi-max is not helpful when any interface comes due to
waves such as microwaves or the phones which have the
same frequency that is used by 802.11g and 802.11b i.e.
2.4GHZ
III. APPLICATION AREAS
There are wide ranges of applications of the networking.
Networking is very much used in every field of life now a
day. The use of the networking is increasing day-to-day at a
very high speed. Some applications are:
Groupware is new networking application developed
which allows the groups of different users to share their
files, databases schedules.
Due to networking the scheduling of the programs allow
the users to easily access the network and schedule there
meetings, appointments and other important tasks.
Teleconferencing application of the networking allows the
users to attend their meetings or conferences using the
telephone lines [9].
The Internet service providers can easily assign IP’s to the
users with the help of the networking.
The remote accessing of the networking allows the persons
to easily manage their office works form any corner of the
world.
