ON THE UNICITY OF THE HOMOTOPY THEORY OF HIGHER
CATEGORIES
CLARK BARWICK AND CHRISTOPHER SCHOMMER-PRIES

Abstract. We propose four axioms that a quasicategory should satisfy to be
considered a reasonable homotopy theory of (∞, n)-categories. This axiomatization requires that a homotopy theory of (∞, n)-categories, when equipped
with a small amount of extra structure, satisfies a simple, yet surprising, universal property. We further prove that the space of such quasicategories is
homotopy equivalent to (RP∞ )n . In particular, any two such quasicategories
are equivalent. This generalizes a theorem of To¨
en when n = 1, and it verifies two conjectures of Simpson. We also provide a large class of examples of
models satisfying our axioms, including those of Joyal, Kan, Lurie, Rezk, and
Simpson.

1. Introduction
The chaotic prehistory of higher category theory, whose origins can be traced to
an assortment of disciplines, has borne a diverse subject with a range of apparatuses intended to formalize the imagined common themes in the notions of operad,
monoidal category, n-category, homotopy algebra (of various flavors), higher stack,
and even aspects of manifold theory. The rush to put the ideas of higher category
theory on a firm foundational footing has led to a rich landscape — but also to
a glut of definitions, each constructed upon different principles. Until now, there
has been very little machinery available to compare the various notions of higher
category that have been proposed.
The search for a useful comparison of the various notions of higher category
has been an elusive and long-standing goal [31]. In their proposal for the 2004
IMA program on n-categories, Baez and May underlined the difficulties of this
Comparison Problem:
It is not a question as to whether or not a good definition exists. Not
one, but many, good definitions already do exist [. . . ]. There is growing general agreement on the basic desiderata of a good definition
of n-category, but there does not yet exist an axiomatization, and
there are grounds for believing that only a partial axiomatization
may be in the cards.
In what follows we provide just such an axiomatization for the theory of (∞, n)categories. We propose simple but powerful axioms for a homotopy theory to be
considered a reasonable homotopy theory of (∞, n)-categories [Df. 6.8]. We are then
able to address the Comparison Problem very precisely:

• We show that these axioms uniquely characterize the homotopy theory of
(∞, n)-categories up to equivalence. [Rk. 6.9]
• We show that the topological group of self-equivalences of this homotopy
theory is homotopy equivalent to the discrete group (Z/2)n [Th. 8.12].
• We provide a recipe with which one may generate models of (∞, n)-categories
satisfying these axioms [Th. 9.2], and we apply it to show that two of the
best-known models of (∞, n)-categories satisfy our axioms [Th. 11.15 and
Th. 12.6].
For the theory of (∞, n)-categories, we regard this as a complete solution to the
Comparison Problem. Our result verifies two conjectures proposed by Simpson [40,
Conjectures 2 and 3] and also permits us to generalize beautiful and difficult theorems of Bergner [11] and To¨en [42].
The Comparison Problem when n = 1. The Comparison Problem for (∞, 1)categories has already received a great deal of attention, and by now there is a
solution that is both elegant and informative. The theory of (∞, 1)-categories, otherwise known as the homotopy theory of homotopy theories, admits a number of
different descriptions. The most popular of these are the Quillen model categories

depicted in Fig. 1. These model categories are connected by the intricate web of
Quillen equivalences depicted,1 but this diagram fails to commute, even up to natural isomorphism; so although these model categories are all Quillen equivalent, there
is an overabundance of ostensibly incompatible Quillen equivalences available.
This unpleasant state of affairs was resolved by To¨en’s groundbreaking work [42],
inspired by conjectures of Simpson [40]. To¨en sets forth seven axioms necessary for
a model category to be regarded as a model category of (∞, 1)-categories, and he
shows that any model category satisfying these axioms is Quillen equivalent to
1The dotted arrow connecting the simplicial categories with the relative categories is not a
Quillen equivalence, but it is an equivalence of relative categories. See [20, 3, 21]

Rezk’s theory of complete Segal spaces (CSS). More importantly, To¨en shows that
these Quillen equivalences are unique up to coherent homotopy in a sense we now
describe.
Any model category A gives rise to a simplicial category LH A via the Dwyer–Kan
hammock localization [18]. This is a functorial construction under which Quillen
equivalences are carried to equivalences of simplicial categories [19]. Consequently,
Fig. 1 can be regarded as a diagram of equivalences in the model category Cat∆ .
As such, its commutativity (up to coherent homotopy) is governed by the derived
space of automorphisms of any one of the objects involved. To¨en computes [42,
Th. 6.3] that the derived automorphism space of LH (CSS) in Cat∆ is equivalent to
the discrete group Z/2.
Thus To¨en’s theorem immediately implies that, modulo a potential Z/2 ambiguity, Fig. 1 commutes up to higher coherent homotopy. A more careful consideration
shows that this Z/2-ambiguity is not a problem; To¨en’s theorem also shows that the
action of Z/2 arises from the formation of the opposite homotopy theory, and so the
two possibilities are distinguished by considering the restriction to the subcategory
consisting of the terminal object and the 1-cell.
Our results. One lesson drawn from the Comparison Problem for n = 1 is that
the essential structure of a homotopy theory is best captured by working within
one of the six models from Fig. 1. As a matter of convenience we employ the language of quasicategories as our chosen model of the homotopy theory of homotopy
theories. We do this primarily because Joyal and Lurie have thoroughly developed
the necessary technology of limits, colimits, and presentability in this setting, and
this material has appeared in print [32]. We do not use the quasicategory model in
any essential way; in fact, if this technology were transported to any of the other
models in Fig. 1, our results could be proven there with no more difficulty.
Within a quasicategory is a distinguished class of objects: the 0-truncated objects; these are objects X such that for any object A the mapping space Map(A, X)
is homotopy equivalent to a discrete space. The 0-truncated objects in the quasicategory S of spaces are precisely the spaces that are homotopy equivalent to sets.
Put differently, the 0-truncated spaces are precisely the spaces whose homotopy
theory is trivial. Furthermore, the homotopy theory of spaces is in a strong sense
controlled by a single 0-truncated object — the one-point space. To be more precise, S is freely generated under homotopy colimits by the one-point space, so that
any homotopy-colimit-preserving functor S → C is essentially uniquely specified by
its value on the one-point space. As we presently explain, the homotopy theory
of (∞, n)-categories is similarly controlled by a small collection of its 0-truncated
objects.
Historically, the passage from the strict theory of n-categories to a weak theory
thereof is concerned with allowing what were once equations to be replaced with
coherent isomorphisms. Thus the n-categories for which all k-isomorphisms are
identities must by necessity have a trivial weak theory, regardless of the form that
this weak theory will ultimately take. In §3 we define the gaunt n-categories to be
precisely those n-categories in which all k-isomorphisms are identities.2 We observe
[Rk. 4.7] that the monoidal category of auto-equivalences of the category Gauntn
is equivalent to the discrete category (Z/2)n .
2Gaunt n-categories were called rigid in [38], but alas this conflicts with standard terminology.

The homotopy hypothesis is a basic desideratum for any good theory of higher
categories. It asks that the homotopy theory of n-groupoids (those n-categories
in which all morphisms are equivalences) inside the homotopy theory of weak ncategories be equivalent to the homotopy theory of n-types. Or, more generally,
that inside the homotopy theory (∞, n)-categories the the theory of ∞-groupoids
is equivalent to the homotopy theory of spaces. In light of this principle one may
think of the gaunt n-categories as what is left of higher category theory after one
strips away all traces of topology.
Any purported homotopy theory C of weak n-categories must necessarily include
the gaunt n-categories among the 0-truncated objects. In fact, the subcategory
τ≤0 C of 0-truncated objects must be equivalent to the category Gauntn of gaunt
n-categories; however, perhaps unsurprisingly, this property alone is not enough to
determine the homotopy theory of (∞, n)-categories. We are then presented with
the problem of finding further properties that characterize this homotopy theory.
The existence of internal mapping objects in the quasicategory of (∞, n)-categories
is an obviously desirable property. One of the fundamental results pertaining to
Rezk’s theory of complete Segal Θn -spaces is that, in this model, these internal
homs exist at the model category level [38] (i.e., it is a cartesian model category).
So it is reasonable to require the existence of internal homs at the quasicategory
level. In fact, we will go further and demand the existence of internal homs for the
quasicategory of correspondences.
Correspondences serve several roles both in classical category theory and in the
theory of (∞, 1)-categories. Also called a profunctor, distributor, or module, a correspondence between categories A and B is defined to be a functor
A × Bop → Set .
The existence of internal homs for Cat readily implies the existence of internal
homs for the categories of correspondences. While the above is the more common
definition, a correspondence may equivalently be understood as a single functor
M → C1 to the 1-cell (a.k.a. free walking arrow). The categories A and B may
then be recovered as the fibers of M over the objects 0 and 1. Both this description
and the existence of internal homs holds for the theory of (∞, 1)-categories [29,
Th. 7.9]. Moreover there is an analogous higher theory of correspondences for gaunt
n-categories, with the role of the 1-cell played by any higher cell Ck (0 ≤ k ≤ n)
[§ 5].
As the 0-truncated objects in any quasicategory are closed under fiber products, any purported homotopy theory C of weak n-categories must also necessarily
contain this theory of higher correspondences, at least for τ≤0 C the 0-truncated
objects. The category Υn — which is defined [Df. 5.6] as the smallest subcategory
containing the cells that is closed under retracts and fiber products over cells — is
the minimal subcategory of gaunt n-categories for which there is a good theory of
higher correspondences, and as such should have an important role in any potential weak theory of n-categories. Moreover, the building blocks of higher category
theory — various kinds of cells and pasting diagrams — are themselves objects of
Υn .
These considerations go some distance toward motivating our axiomatization,
which consists of four axioms and is given in Df. 6.8. Our first axiom, the axiom
of strong generation, requires that a homotopy theory C of (∞, n)-categories be
generated under canonical homotopy colimits by an embedded copy of Υn . This

ON THE UNICITY OF THE HOMOTOPY THEORY OF HIGHER CATEGORIES

5

generalizes the case in which n = 0, where C = S and Υ0 consists of the single
one-point space.
Now, as Υn contains the cells, one may define the k-correspondences of C as the
overcategory C/Ck over the k-cell. The next axiom is that correspondences have
internal homs. As we have seen, this extends the theory of correspondences to
the (∞, n)-categorical context.
These two axioms can be understood to provide C with a set of generators and
relations in the ∞-categorical sense. Our third axiom, the axiom of fundamental
pushouts, imposes further relations by demanding that a finite list of very simple
homotopy pushouts of objects in Υn do not create unexpected homotopy theory.
These pushouts are just enough to express the fiber products of cells (Ci ×Cj Ck )
as iterated colimits of cells (Axiom (C.3.a-c)) and to ensure the proper notion of
equivalence (Axiom (C.3.d)).
We then define, somewhat optimistically, a homotopy theory of (∞, n)-categories
as any homotopy theory that is freely generated by Υn , subject only to the requirement that these two classes of relations hold. In other words the homotopy
theory of (∞, n)-categories is universal with respect to the first three properties.
Employing techniques discussed by Dugger [15] in the context of model categories,
we are able to show that such a universal homotopy theory exists [Th. 7.6].
Of course a homotopy theory C is unique up to a contractible choice once the
generators have been identified; it turns out that such a choice amounts to an identification of its subcategory τ≤0 C of 0-truncated objects with the category Gauntn
[Cor. 8.6]. This identification is not unique, but it is unique up to the action of
(Z/2)n on Gauntn via the formation of the opposite in each degree [Lm. 4.6],
whence we deduce that the space of quasicategories that satisfy our axioms is
B(Z/2)n [Th. 8.12]. We may informally summarize the situation by saying that
our axioms uniquely characterize the homotopy theory of (∞, n)-categories, up to
orientation of the k-morphisms for each 1 ≤ k ≤ n.
To lend credence to our axioms, we must show that some widely accepted models
of (∞, n)-categories satisfy them. In § 9 we begin this task by studying models of the
homotopy theory of (∞, n)-categories that arise as localizations of the homotopy
theory of simplicial presheaves on a suitable category. We present a very general
recognition principle [Th. 9.2] for these sorts of models, and use it to show that the
complete Segal Θn -spaces of [38] and the n-fold complete Segal spaces of [2] are
each homotopy theories of (∞, n)-categories [Th. 11.15 and Th. 12.6]. These proofs
are rather technical, but as a consequence, we find that these homotopy theories
are equivalent [Cor. 12.7], reproducing a key result of Bergner and Rezk [13].
In the final section § 13, we show that our uniqueness result also guarantees
that the combinatorial model category of (∞, n)-categories is unique up to Quillen
equivalence. Using a range of results of Bergner, Lurie, and Simpson (some of which
remain unpublished), we describe how many of the remaining purported homotopy
theories of (∞, n)-categories may also be shown to satisfy our axioms.
The (∞, n + 1)-category of (∞, n)-categories. Since early preprint versions of
this work were first distributed, we were asked what these results tell us about the
(∞, n + 1)-category of (∞, n)-categories. We would like to take the opportunity to
address this point now.
As a consequence of our axiomatization it follows that the quasicategory of
(∞, n)-categories is cartesian closed. This means that it admits products and that

6

for each object X ∈ Cat(∞,n) the functor X×(−) admits a right adjoint, the internal
hom. Suppose, for the sake of argument, that there exists a process which produces
a quasicategory V Cat of ‘categories weakly enriched in V’ for any ‘monoidal quasicategory’ V. Suppose further that this process satisfies the following requirements:
(a) A cartesian closed quasicategory is in particular a monoidal quasicategory.
Moreover for each cartesian closed quasicategory there exists a distinguished
object V ∈ V Cat (V is enriched in itself);
(b) The construction of V Cat and, when it makes sense, V are functorial in V;
and
(c) If V is a homotopy theory of (∞, n)-categories (with the categorical product), then V Cat is a homotopy theory of (∞, n + 1)-categories.
Such a process, paired with the results of this paper, would immediately specify the
(∞, n + 1)-category of (∞, n)-categories as well. It seems immensely plausible that
such a process should exist, though we do not address that in this paper. At the time
of this writing the authors know of no general theory of enriched higher categories
which is shown to satisfy all of these requirements, though the very recent work of
Haugseng appears extremely promising [25]. However there are such constructions
which apply to a limited class of quasicategories V, such as those which arise from
sufficiently nice monoidal model categories. Some of these are touched upon in the
final section § 13.
Acknowledgments. We hope that the preceding paragraphs have highlighted the
tremendous influence of the ideas and results of Carlos Simpson and Bertrand To¨en
on our work here. Without the monumental foundational work of Andr´e Joyal and
Jacob Lurie on quasicategories, it would not be possible even to state our axioms,
let alone prove anything about them. We thank Charles Rezk for his remarkably
influential work on complete Θn -spaces, which lead to the discovery of the importance of the class of gaunt n-categories, and, moreover, for spotting critical mistakes
in earlier versions of this paper. We would also like to extend special thanks to Ricardo Andrade, Dimitri Ara, David Carchedi, Moritz Groth, and Javier Guti´errez,
whose careful reading uncovered several smaller errors.
2. Strict n-categories
Definition 2.1. A small strict 0-category is a set. Proceeding recursively, for any
positive integer n, a small strict n-category is a small category enriched in small
(n − 1)-categories. A functor between strict n-categories will mean a functor in the
enriched sense. We denote by Catn the category of small strict n-categories and
functors.
For the rest of this paper we will hold the convention that, unless otherwise
stated, all strict n-categories are small (see also Rk. 5.5). A set can be regarded
as a 1-category with only identity morphisms, and this gives an inclusion functor
Set ֒→ Cat = Cat1 . By induction this yields an inclusion Cat(n−1) ֒→ Catn for
any positive integer n. Strict n-categories in the image of Cat0 = Set will be called
discrete.
If idempotents split in a given ambient category C with pullbacks, then internal
category objects admit the following equivalent single sorted description: a category
internal to C consists of an object C together with a category structure (∗, s, t),

ON THE UNICITY OF THE HOMOTOPY THEORY OF HIGHER CATEGORIES

consisting of self maps s, t : C → C satisfying equations
s2 = ts = s

t2 = st = t

together with an associative partial multiplication (the composition)
∗ : C ×s,t
C C →C
over C × C admitting units. This last means that ∗ ◦ (s × id) = pr2 : C ×s,t
C C →C
and ∗ ◦ (id ×s) = pr1 : C ×s,t
C
→
C.
If
C
is
concrete
—
so
that
we
may
speak of
C
elements of C — these equations would be written x ∗ f = f and g ∗ x = g where
x is in the image of s (or equivalently in the image of t).
A strict n-category is a category that is not internal to but enriched in strict
(n− 1)-categories. This means that a strict n-category may be viewed as an internal
category which satisfies an additional globularity condition ensuring that the image
of the source (or target) map consists of a discrete (n − 1)-category. Unraveling this
we see that a strict n-category consists of a single set C of cells together with a
family of category structures (∗i , si , ti ) for 1 ≤ i ≤ n. Whenever i < j, the maps
(∗i , si , ti ) preserve the category structure (∗j , sj , tj ); they are functors. Moreover
the images of si and ti consist of identity cells with respect to the j th composition
(this last requirement is the globularity condition).
Example 2.2. The following are some important examples of strict n-categories:
• The 0-cell C0 is the singleton set, viewed as a strict n-category. This is also
the terminal strict n-category.
• The the empty n-category ∅. Later it will be convenient to denote this
category by ∂C0 = ∅.
• The 1-category E is the “walking isomorphism”, that is the groupoid, equivalent to the terminal category, with two objects.
• By induction the k-cell Ck is a strict k-category (and hence a strict ncategory for any n ≥ k) defined as follows: The k-cell Ck has two objects
⊤ and ⊥. These objects only have identity endomorphisms. The remaining
hom (k − 1)-categories are homCk (⊥, ⊤) = ∅, and homCk (⊤, ⊥) = Ck−1 .
There is a unique composition making this a strict k-category.
• The maximal sub-(k − 1)-category of the k-cell, denoted ∂Ck , is the (k − 1)category of “walking parallel (k − 1)-morphisms”.
• A finite ordinal S gives rise to a 1-category ∆S , whose object consist of the
elements of S and where there is a unique morphism s → s′ if and only if
s ≤ s′ . The simplex category of finite ordinals will be denoted ∆, as usual.
Generalizing the fourth example, let C be a strict n-category. We obtain a strict
(n + 1)-category σC, the suspension of C, as follows. As a set we have σC =
C ∪ {⊤, ⊥}. The first category structure on σC has constant source and target
maps, s1 = const⊤ and t1 = const⊥ . There is a unique composition making this a
category structure (∗1 , s1 , t1 ). For j > 1, the j th category structure on σC is the
unique one which agrees with the (j − 1)th category structure on C and makes
σC into a strict n-category. The k-fold suspension of the zero cell C0 is the k-cell
σ k (C0 ) = Ck .
The suspension functor preserves both pullback and pushout squares in Cat.
We have σ(∅) ∼
= ∂C1 , and hence by induction the k-fold suspension of
= C0 ⊔ C0 ∼
k
∼
∅ is σ (∅) = σ k−1 (C0 ∪∅ C0 ) ∼
= ∂Ck . From this description
= Ck−1 ∪∂Ck−1 Ck−1 ∼

8

CLARK BARWICK AND CHRISTOPHER SCHOMMER-PRIES

the canonical functor ∂Ck → Ck−1 arises as the suspension of the unique functor
C0 ⊔ C0 → C0 .
There are many other functors relating the categories Catk for various k. We
describe a few. The fully-faithful inclusion i of strict k-categories into strict ncategories gives rise to a sequence of adjoint functors: π ⊣ i ⊣ j. The right adjoint
jk : Catn → Catk associates to a strict n-category X the maximal sub-k-category
jk X.
Proposition 2.3. The following two properties are equivalent and characterize the
maximal sub-k-category jk X:
• For all k-categories Y , every functor Y → X factors uniquely through jk X.
• For all cells Ci with 0 ≤ i ≤ k, every functor Ci → X factors uniquely
through jk X.
The following proposition is standard.
Proposition 2.4. The cells (Ci , 0 ≤ i ≤ n) generate Catn under colimits, i.e. the
smallest full subcategory of Catn containing the cells and closed under colimits is
all of Catn .
3. Gaunt n-categories
Definition 3.1. A strict n-category X is gaunt if for all 1 ≤ k ≤ n X is local with
respect to the functor σ k−1 E → σ k−1 (∗) = Ck−1 , that is, the following natural
map is a bijection,
Catk (Ck−1 , X) → Catk (σ k−1 E, X).
Equivalently, for any k ≤ n, the only invertible k-morphisms of X are the identities.
Lemma 3.2 ([38, Pr. 11.23]). In a gaunt n-category, any equivalence is an identity.
Remark 3.3. The suspension σX of a gaunt n-category is gaunt. Since the truncation πE = C0 , if X is gaunt, then so is jk X for all k.
Rezk observed [38, § 10] that E may be formed in Cat as a pushout of more
elementary n-categories, namely as the pushout
K := ∆3 ∪(∆

{0,2}

⊔∆{1,3} )

(∆0 ⊔ ∆0 ).

Thus a strict n-category is gaunt if and only if for each k ≥ 0 the following natural
map is a bijection:
Fun(Ck , X) → Fun(σ k (∆3 ), X) ×Fun(σk (∆{0,2} ⊔∆{1,3} ),X) Fun(σ k (∆0 ⊔ ∆0 ), X).
Corollary 3.4 (of the definition). The inclusion of the gaunt n-categories into all
strict n-categories admits a left adjoint LG that realizes the full subcategory Gauntn
of Catn spanned by the gaunt n-categories as a localization.
It follows from this corollary that gaunt n-categories form a presentable category
Gauntn . In fact, we have the following result.
Lemma 3.5. The category Gauntn is finitely presentable.

Proof. It is enough to show that the inclusion Gauntn ֒→ Catn commutes with
filtered colimits. To this end, suppose Λ a filtered category, and suppose D : Λ →
Catn a diagram such that for any object α ∈ Λ, the n-category Dα is gaunt. We
claim that the colimit D = colimα∈Λ Dα (formed in Catn ) is gaunt as well. This
claim now follows from the fact that both Ck and σ k (E) are compact objects in
Catn .
Remark 3.6. As a consequence of the previous result, the category Gauntn can be
identified with the category of Ind-objects of the full subcategory Gauntω
n ⊂ Gauntn
spanned by the compact objects of Gauntn . That is [35, Cor. 2.1.9′ ], for any category
D that admits all filtered colimits, if Funω (Gauntn , D) denotes the full subcategory
of Fun(Gauntn , D) spanned by those functors that preserve filtered colimits, then
the restriction functor
Funω (Gauntn , D) → Fun(Gauntω
n , D)
is an equivalence.
Corollary 3.7. The smallest full subcategory of Gauntn closed under colimits and
containing the cells of dimension ≤ k is Gauntk .
Proof. The inclusion of gaunt k-categories commutes with colimits (as it admits a
right adjoint, see Rk. 3.3) and so it is enough to consider just the case k = n. This
now follows readily from Cor. 3.4 and Pr. 2.4.
4. Automorphisms of the category of gaunt n-categories.
We now demonstrate that the category of auto-equivalences of the category of
gaunt n-categories is the discrete group (Z/2)n .
Lemma 4.1. There is a unique natural endo-transformation of the identity functor
on the category of gaunt n-categories.
Proof. Such a natural transformation consists of component maps (i.e. functors)
ηX : X → X for each gaunt n-category X. We will show that ηX = idX for all X.
The functor ηX induces, for all 0 ≤ k ≤ n a map on sets of k-cells, (ηX )k : Xk → Xk ,
and since a functor is completely determined by the map on cells, it is enough to
show that each (ηX )k is the identity. By naturality of η it is enough to show that
the single functor ηCn = idCn . We will prove that ηCk = idCk by inducting on k.
When k = 0 there is a unique such functor, so ηC0 = idC0 . By induction ηCk is a
functor which restricts to the identity functor on ∂Ck . There is only one functor
with this property, namely ηCk = idCk .
Definition 4.2. The globular category Gn consists of the full subcategory of Gauntn
consisting of the i-cells Ci for i ≤ n. An n-globular set is a presheaf of sets on Gn .
The k-cells Xk of a globular set is the set obtained by evaluating the presheaf X
on Ck .
Remark 4.3. The globular sets considered here are sometimes called reflexive globular sets, the difference being that our globular category Gn includes degeneracies
Ck → Ck−1 . We will have no use for non-reflexive globular sets in this paper, and
so drop the distinction.

Let C be a set with a category structure (∗, s, t). By reversing the order of
composition, we may obtain a new category structure on C, the opposite (∗op , t, s).
This operation leaves the identity cells unchanged, and so is compatible with the
globularity condition. This implies that for each element I ∈ (Z/2)n we obtain an
auto-equivalence rI of the category of strict n-categories. The strict n-category rI C
is that whose underlying set is the same and whose ith -category structure either
agrees with that of C or is the opposite of that of C, according to whether the
ith -coordinate of I is trivial or not. Composition of the rI corresponds to the group
structure in (Z/2)n , and each functor restricts to an equivalence rI : Gn → Gn .
Proposition 4.4. Every auto-equivalence of Gn is isomorphic to rI for some element I ∈ (Z/2)n .
Proof. First we observe that the k-cell Ck ∈ Gn is the unique object such that, up
to isomorphism, there exists precisely k other objects of Gn which occur as proper
retracts (namely all the cells Ci with 0 ≤ i < k). Thus every auto-equivalence F of
Gn must fix the objects identically, F (Ck ) = Ck .
Next we observe that for i < j, there exists precisely one epimorphism Cj ։ Ci .
Since epimorphisms are preserved by any equivalence of categories, this unique
epimorphism is also preserved by F . Similarly for each 0 ≤ i < n, there exist
precisely two monomorphisms Ci ֒→ Cn ; these are either preserved identically by F
or permuted. Thus every auto-equivalence determines a symbol I ∈ (Z/2)n which
records wether the ith pair of monomorphisms Ci ֒→ Cn is permuted or not. The
symbol corresponding to rI is, of course, I.
Finally, we observe that the symbol I in fact determines the functor F . Indeed,
every morphisms Ci → Cj in Gn admits a factorization
Ci ։ Ck ֒→ Cn ։ Cj
for some Ck ∈ Gn . Thus F = rI .
Lemma 4.5. Let F be an auto-equivalence of the category of gaunt n-categories.
Then F restricts to an equivalence between Gn and its essential image in the gaunt
n-categories, i.e. F (Ck ) ∼
= Ck for all 0 ≤ k ≤ n.
Proof. The proper retracts of Cn are precisely the cells Ck for 0 ≤ k < n and,
as before, each Ck is distinguished as the unique such retract such that, up to
isomorphism, there exists precisely k other objects which occur as further proper
retracts (the cells of even lower dimension). Thus it is enough to show that F (Cn ) ∼
=
Cn for the n-cell alone, as this implies the analogous statement F (Ck ) ∼
= Ck for all
0 ≤ k ≤ n.
Recall that a generator of a category C is an object X such that C(X, −) : C → Set
is faithful [34, pg. 127]. The collection of generators is preserved under any autoequivalence. The n-cell Cn is a generator for Catn and hence also Gauntn , however
the k-cells Ck for k < n are not generators. Thus no proper retract of Cn is a
generator. This property characterizes the n-cell (up to isomorphism) among all
generators: it is the unique generator such that every proper retract fails to be
a generator. If this characterization holds, then any auto-equivalence necessarily
preserves the n-cell up to automorphism and the lemma follows.

ON THE UNICITY OF THE HOMOTOPY THEORY OF HIGHER CATEGORIES

11

In fact we will prove a stronger statement, that the n-cell itself is a retract of
every generator. For this consider the gaunt n-category ∂Cn+1 . This is the freewalking-pair-of-parallel-n-morphisms, and may be written as
∂Cn+1 = Cn ∪∂Cn Cn .
There are exactly two non-identity n-morphisms in ∂Cn+1 and this gives rise to
two morphism from Cn to ∂Cn+1 (which send the non-trivial n-morphism of Cn
to one or the other of these n-morphisms). These two functors differ only on the
non-identity n-morphism of Cn , the induce the identical functor on the maximal
(n − 1)-subcateogry ∂Cn .
Suppose that X is a generator. Then there must exist a functor X → Cn whose
image includes the non-trivial cell of Cn , for otherwise C(X, −) would not be able
to distinguish the above pair of maps Cn → ∂Cn+1 , contradicting the fact that X
is a generator. Thus there exists a functor X → Cn , and an n-cell of X which maps
via this functor to the non-trivial n-cell of Cn . Since Cn is the free n-category on
an n-cell, there is a section Cn → X, which hits this n-cell of X. In other words we
have exhibited Cn as a retract of X.
Remark. At this point we would like to take the opportunity to thank Dimitri Ara
who pointed out an error in an earlier version of the above lemma. As Dimitri
observed, this earlier version used an incorrect characterization of the cells which
was based on a similarly incorrect characterization of the 1-cell in Freyd’s Abelian
Categories [23]. It wasn’t until its most recent reprinting [24] that this error was
found and corrected. The above proof is inspired from remarks in the forward of
[24]. Dimitri also pointed out errors in a previous version of the following lemma,
and for that we are equally grateful. Alternative proofs of both these lemmas have
recently appeared in work of Dimitri Ara, Moritz Groth, and Javier Guti´errez [1].
Lemma 4.6. Any auto-equivalence of the category Gauntn is isomorphic to a functor of the form rI for some I ∈ (Z/2)n .
Proof. By the previous lemma, every auto-equivalence F restricts to an autoequivalence of Gn , which by Pr. 4.4 is necessarily of the form rI for some I ∈ (Z/2)n .
It suffices to prove that F ◦ rI ≃ rI ◦ rI ≃ id, and so without loss of generality we
may assume rI = id, that is, that F restricts to the identity functor on Gn . Now in
this case, the isomorphisms
Gauntn (Ck , X) ∼
= Gauntn (F (Ck ), F (X)) = Gauntn (Ck , F (X))
∼
are natural in both Ck and X, whence one obtains a natural isomorphism γ : U =
U ◦ F , where U : Gauntn → Fun(Gop
,
Set)
is
the
forgetful
functor
from
gaunt
nn
categories to globular sets. It thus remains to show that this natural isomorphism
is compatible with the compositions ∗j .
For this, write
wj : Cj → Cj ∪Cj−1 Cj

12

CLARK BARWICK AND CHRISTOPHER SCHOMMER-PRIES

for the morphism that corepresents the composition law ∗j . Since F preserves
pushouts, one obtains a commutative diagram
Cj

Cj ∪Cj−1 Cj
F (Cj ) ∪F (Cj−1 ) F (Cj )
∼
=

F (Cj )

Cj−1

F (wj )

F (Cj ∪

Cj ).

Hence for any gaunt n-category X, we obtain a commutative diagram

Gauntn (F (Cj ∪Cj−1 Cj ), F (X))

Gauntn (Cj ∪Cj−1 Cj , F (X))

Gauntn (Cj , F (X))

in which the top and bottom morphisms are exactly the composition functors.
Hence the natural isomorphism γ is compatible with compositions, whence it lifts
to a natural isomorphism id ∼
= F , as desired.
Remark 4.7. It follows from the results of this section that the category of autoequivalences of Gauntn is equivalent to the discrete group (Z/2)n .
Combining these results with Rm. 3.6 we obtain:
Corollary 4.8. For each regular cardinal κ, the automorphisms of the category
Gauntκn of κ-compact gaunt n-categories is the diescrete group (Z/2)n .
5. Correspondences and the category Υn
The category of of gaunt n-categories is cartesian closed. Consequently, Gauntn
is a category enriched in strict n-categories, hence a (large) strict (n + 1)-category.
In fact any skeleton of Gauntn is a (large) gaunt (n + 1)-category.
A correspondence between ordinary categories A and B has several equivalent
definitions. The two of most relevance here are:
(a) a functor m : Aop × B → Set;
(b) a category M with a functor M → C1 , together with equivalences A ≃ M0
and B ≃ M1 , where Mi denotes the fiber over the object i ∈ C1 .
Consequently we regard the category Cat /C1 as the category of correspondences.
The notion of correspondence generalizes to gaunt n-categories in a manner we now
describe.
Definition 5.1. A correspondence (or k-correspondence, for clarity) of gaunt ncategories is an object of Gauntn /Ck , that is a gaunt n-category M equipped with
a functor M → Ck .

ON THE UNICITY OF THE HOMOTOPY THEORY OF HIGHER CATEGORIES

13

Example 5.2. If X is a gaunt (n − k)-category, then σ k (!) : σ k (X) → σ k (pt) = Ck
is naturally a k-correspondence.
Proposition 5.3. There is a canonical equivalence of categories between the category of k-correspondences Gauntn /Ck and the category of triples (Ms , Mt , m) where
Ms , Mt ∈ Gauntn /Ck−1 are (k − 1)-correspondences and
m : Msop ×Ck−1 Mt → σ k−1 (Gauntn−k )
is a functor of (k − 1)-correspondences, where Gauntn−k is regarded as a (large)
gaunt (n − k + 1)-category via the internal hom.
The equivalence is implemented by sending M → Ck to the fibers Ms and Mt
over the inclusions s, t : Ck−1 → Ck . The functor m may be obtained by considering
certain associated lifting diagrams. We leave the details as an amusing exercise for
the interested reader, as they will not be needed here.
Corollary 5.4. The categories of correspondences, Gauntn /Ck , are cartesian closed.
Proof. When k = 0 this is merely the statement that Gauntn is cartesian closed. For
general k, the result follows from induction, using the equivalence from Pr. 5.3.
Remark 5.5. If desired it is possible to avoid the use of large n-categories in the
above. Instead of considering all correspondences, one considers only those correspondences in which the size of M is bounded by a fixed cardinality κ. A similar
version of the above preposition holds with Gauntn−k replaced by a small gaunt
(n − k + 1)-category of gaunt (n − k)-categories whose size is similarly bounded by
κ. Allowing κ to vary, one still recovers the above corollary.
We regard the existence of internal homs for correspondences as one of the key
defining properties of the theory of n-categories, and an analog of this forms one
of our main axioms for the the theory of (∞, n)-categories. A weak theory of ncategories should contain the cells and a similar theory of correspondences. This
suggests that the following category Υn should have an important role in any potential weak theory of n-categories.
Definition 5.6. The category Υn is the smallest full subcategory of Gauntn containing the globular category Gn of cells that is closed under retracts and fiber
products over cells, (X, Y ) → X ×Ck Y .
Example 5.7. The simplex category ∆ is a subcategory of Υ1 . To see this first
observe that [0] = C0 , [1] = C1 , and that [2] is a retract of C1 × C1 . Hence
[0], [1], [2] ∈ Υ1 . From this we see that [n] ∈ Υ1 from either the formula
[n] = [2] ×[1] [2] ×[1] · · · ×[1] [2],
n−1 times

or by observing that [n] is a retract of [1]×n . More generally, one may show that
Joyal’s category Θn of “n-disks” (Df. 10.2) is a subcategory of Υn .
We will now examine the fiber products of cells in detail. We aim to express
these fiber products as simple iterated colimits of cells. Let ϕ : Ci → Cj and
ψ : Ck → Cj be a pair of maps (i, j, k ≥ 0). A map of cells ϕ : Ci → Cj either
factors as a composite Ci → C0 → Cj or is a suspension ϕ = σ(φ) for some map
φ : Ci−1 → Cj−1 . This leads to several cases. We will first consider the case in

14

CLARK BARWICK AND CHRISTOPHER SCHOMMER-PRIES

which ϕ fails to be the suspension of a map of lower dimensional cells. In this case
we have a diagram of pullback squares
Ci × F

F

Ck
ψ

Ci

C0

Cj

Here F is the fiber of ψ : Ck → Cj over the unique object in the image of ϕ. There
are four possibilities:
• The image of ψ may be disjoint from the image of ϕ, in which case F =
∂C0 = ∅. Hence F and also Ci × F are the empty colimit of cells.
• The fiber may be a zero cell, F = C0 , in which case Ci × F ∼
= Ci is trivially
a colimit of cells.
• The fiber may be an m-cell F ∼
= Cm for some 1 ≤ m ≤ k, but we have
i = 0. In this case Ci × F ∼
=F ∼
= Cm is again trivially a colimit of cells.
• The fiber may be an m-cell F ∼
= Cm for some 1 ≤ m ≤ k, and we have
i ≥ 1. In this case we have (cf. [38, Pr. 4.9])
Ci × Cm ∼
= (Ci ∪C0 Cm ) ∪σ(Ci−1 ×Cm−1 ) (Cm ∪C0 Ci )
where for each pushout Cx ∪C0 Cy , the object C0 is included into the final
object of Cx and the initial object of Cy .
As the suspension functor σ commutes with pullback squares, a general pullback
of cells is the suspension of one of the three kinds just considered. Moreover, as the
suspension functor also commutes with pushout squares, the above considerations
give a recipe for writing any fiber product of cells as an iterated pushout of cells.
This will be made precise in Lm. 5.10 below by considering presheaves on Υn .
The inclusion Υn → Gauntn induces a fully-faithful nerve functor
ν : Gauntn → Fun(Υop
n , Set).
In particular we may regard gaunt n-categories as particular presheaves of sets on
the category Υn (precisely which presheaves is determined in Cor. 8.6). The nerve
functor commutes with all limits, hence in particular fiber products.
Notation 5.8. Let S00 consist of the union of the following four finite sets of maps
of presheaves on Υn :
νCi−1 ∪ν(∂Ci−1 ) νCi−1 → ν(∂Ci ) | 0 ≤ i ≤ n − 1
(when i = 0, we interpret this as the empty presheaf mapping to the nerve of the
empty n-category),

Let S0 be the smallest class of morphisms U → V in Fun(Υop
n , Set), closed under
isomorphism, containing S00 , and closed under the operation H ×Ci (−) for all
H ∈ Υn , H → Ci , and V → Ci .
Lemma 5.9. Let X ∈ Gauntn . Then the presheaf of sets νX is local with respect
to the morphisms of S0 .
Proof. Forming each of the pushouts of S00 in Gauntn yields an equivalence, so X is
local with respect to S00 . Let S0′ ⊆ S0 consist of those morphisms (f : U → V ) ∈ S0
such that νX is local with respect to f for all gaunt X. We have observed that S0′
contains S00 . It is also closed under isomorphism. We claim that it is closed under
the operation H ×Ci (−) for all H ∈ Υn .
Let (U → V ) ∈ S0′ . For each G ∈ Υn , we have
Hom(H ×C G, X) ∼
= HomC (H ×C G, X × Ci )
i

∼
= HomCi (G, HomCi (H, X × Ci ))
where HomCi denotes functors of i-correspondences and HomCi (A, B) denotes the
internal hom of Gauntn /Ci . As HomCi (H, X × Ci ) is gaunt, it is local with respect
to U → V . The result now follows easily by comparing the morphism sets in Gauntn
and Gauntn /Ci .
−1
Lemma 5.10. Let S00
Fun(Υop
n , Set) denote the full subcategory of presheaves of
sets which are local with respect to the the morphisms of S00 . Let ϕ : Ci → Cj
and ψ : Ck → Cj be an arbitrary pair of maps (i, j, k ≥ 0). Then ν(Ci ×Cj Ck )
−1
is contained in the smallest full subcategory of S00
Fun(Υop
n , Set) containing the
nerves of cells and closed under isomorphism and the formation of colimits.

Proof. Recall that ν commutes with limits. Let m (≤ i, j, k) be the largest integer
such that ϕ = σ m (g) and ψ = σ m (f ) are both m-fold suspensions of maps, g :
Ci−m → Cj−m and f : Ck−m → Cj−m . Suppose, without loss of generality, that ϕ
is not an (m + 1)-fold suspension of a map. Our previous considerations have shown
that there exists a diagram of pullback squares

In this case the collection of morphisms (a) in S00 provide an iterative construction

is again already a cell. Finally let us suppose that F ∼
= Cℓ with ℓ > 0 and i = m + p
for p > 0. In this case we have,
Ci ×Cj Ck ∼
= Cp+m ×Cm Cℓ+m
is precisely the fiber product considered in the set of morphisms (c) among S00 . One
readily observes that morphisms (b) and (c) in S00 provide an inductive construction
−1
of this fiber product as an iterated colimit of cells in S00
Fun(Υop
n , Set).
Remark 5.11. In the above considerations we have not made use of the collection of
morphisms (d) in S00 . These morphisms are unnecessary for the above arguments
and we only include them in S00 (and hence also in S0 ) for notational consistency
in later sections. (See Not. 7.5 and Df. 6.8 (C.3)).
6. Axioms of the homotopy theory of (∞, n)-categories
Definition 6.1 ([33, 4.4.2]). A functor f : C → D between quasicategories is said
to strongly generate the quasicategory D if the identity transformation id : f → f
exhibits the identity functor idD as a left Kan extension of f along f .
Remark 6.2 ([33, 4.4.4]). Suppose C a small quasicategory, and suppose D a locally
small quasicategory that admits small colimits. Then a functor f : C → D factors
as C → P(C) → D, where P(C) denotes the quasicategory of functors Cop to the
quasicategory S of spaces [32, Df. 5.1.0.1]. Now f strongly generates D if and only
if the functor P(C) → D exhibits D as a localization of P(C).
Moreover, a right adjoint to P(C) → D is given by the composite
j

f⋆

D → P(D) → P(C),
where j denotes the Yoneda embedding.
Lemma 6.3. Suppose C a small quasicategory, and suppose D a locally small quasicategory that admits small colimits. Suppose f : C → D a functor that strongly generates D. For any quasicategory E admitting all small colimits, let FunL (D, E) ⊂
Fun(D, E) denote the full sub-quasicategory consisting of those functors that preserve small colimits. Then the natural functor Fun(D, E) → Fun(C, E) restricts to
a fully faithful functor
FunL (D, E) → Fun(C, E).
Proof. By Remark 6.2, D is a localization of P(C), whence we obtain a fully faithful
embedding FunL (D, E) → FunL (P(C), E). Now by [32, 5.1.5.6], left Kan extension
induces an equivalence Fun(C, E) ≃ FunL (P(C), E). See [32, 5.5.4.20].
Remark. An earlier preprint version of the previous lemma was too strong. We
would like to extend our gratitude to David Carchedi, who first brought this to
our attention, and also to Dimitri Ara, Moritz Groth, and Javier Guti´errez who
independently noticed this error in a preprint version of this lemma.
Notation 6.4. For any quasicategory C, denote by τ≤0 C the full subcategory of C
spanned by the 0-truncated [32, 5.5.6.1] objects. This quasicategory is in fact the
nerve of an ordinary category.

ON THE UNICITY OF THE HOMOTOPY THEORY OF HIGHER CATEGORIES

17

Remark 6.5. Suppose C a presentable quasicategory. Then the inclusion τ≤0 C ֒→
C admits a left adjoint (also denoted τ≤0 ), which exhibits τ≤0 C as an accessible
localization of C [32, 5.5.6.18]. Consequently, for any finite category K, any colimit
functor f : K ⊲ → τ≤0 C, any colimit diagram F : N K ⊲ → C, and any homotopy
η : f |K ≃ F |K , the canonical map r : τ≤0 F (+∞) → f (+∞) is an equivalence in C.
Definition 6.6. Let κ be a regular cardinal. We shall say that a presentable quasicategory C is κ-reduced if C is κ-compactly generated [32, Df. 5.5.7.1] and if the
full subcategory (τ≤0 C)κ ⊆ C of κ-compact 0-truncated objects strongly generates
C. We will say C is reduced if it is κ-reduced for some κ.
Recall [32, Rk. 5.5.6.21] that the 0-truncation τ≤0 C of a presentable ∞-category
C is an accessible localization; consequently, τ≤0 C is itself presentable. It therefore
follows from [32, Rk. 5.4.2.13] that for any regular cardinal κ, the ∞-category
(τ≤0 C)κ is essentially small.
Example 6.7. The quasicategory S of spaces is reduced (even ω-reduced); more
generally, any 1-localic ∞-topos [32, Df. 6.4.5.8] is reduced. The quasicategory of
quasicategories is shown to be reduced in [33, Ex. 4.4.9].
Definition 6.8. We shall say that a quasicategory C is a homotopy theory of (∞, n)categories if there is a fully faithful functor f : Υn ֒→ τ≤0 C such that the following
axioms are satisfied.
(C.1) Strong generation. The composite
Υn ֒→ τ≤0 C ֒→ C
strongly generates C. In particular C is presentable.
(C.2) Correspondences have internal homs. For any morphism η : X →
f (Ci ) of C, the fiber product functor
η ∗ : C/f (Ci ) → C/X
preserves colimits. Since C is presentable this is equivalent to the existence
of internal homs for the categories of correspondences C/f (Ci ) . (hence admits a right adjoint, the internal hom).
(C.3) Fundamental pushouts. Each of the finite number of maps comprising
S00 (see Not. 5.8) is an equivalence, that is:
(a) For each integer 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1 the natural morphism
f (Ci−1 ) ∪f (∂Ci−1 ) f (Ci−1 ) → f (∂Ci )
is an equivalence, as is the natural map from the empty colimit to
f (∅).
(b) For each pair of integers 0 ≤ i < j ≤ n, the natural morphism
f (Cj ) ∪f (Ci ) f (Cj ) → f (Cj ∪Ci Cj )
is an equivalence.
(c) For each 0 ≤ i ≤ n, each 0 < j, k ≤ n − i, and every nondegenerate
morphism Ci+j → Ci and Ci+k → Ci , the natural morphism
(f (Ci+j ∪Ci Ci+k )) ∪f (σ

i+1

(Cj−1 ×Ck−1 ))

is an equivalence.

(f (Ci+k ∪Ci Ci+j )) → f (Ci+j ×Ci Ci+k ),

18

CLARK BARWICK AND CHRISTOPHER SCHOMMER-PRIES

(d) For any 0 ≤ k ≤ n, the natural morphism
(f (Ck ) ⊔ f (Ck )) ∪(f (σ

k

C1 )⊔f (σk C1 ))

f (σ k [3]) → f (Ck )

in C is an equivalence.
(C.4) Universality. For any quasicategory D and any fully faithful functor
g : Υn ֒→ τ≤0 D satisfying the conditions above, there exist a localization
L : C → D and an equivalence L ◦ f ≃ g.
In this situation, we say that the functor f exhibits C as a homotopy theory of
(∞, n)-categories.
We denote by Thy(∞,n) the maximal Kan simplicial set contained in the full
subcategory of the quasicategory of quasicategories [32, 3.0.0.1] spanned by the
homotopy theories of (∞, n)-categories.
Remark 6.9. Clearly any homotopy theory of (∞, n)-categories is reduced. Axioms
(C.1) ensures that the localization in axiom (C.4) is essentially unique, from which it
follows that any two homotopy theories of (∞, n)-categories are equivalent. Consequently, the space Thy(∞,n) is either empty or connected. In the following sections,
we show that not only is the space Thy(∞,n) nonempty, but it contains a class of
familiar quasicategories.
7. A construction of the homotopy theory of (∞, n)-categories
By Rk. 6.2, it follows from Axiom (C.1) that a homotopy theory of (∞, n)categories C may be exhibited as an accessible localization of the quasicategory of
presheaves of spaces on Υn ⊆ Gauntn . Many well-known examples of homotopy theories of (∞, n)-categories are exhibited as an accessible localizations of presheaves
of spaces on smaller categories. Thus, although this section is primarily concerned
with the construction of a universal quasicategory satisfying axioms (C.1-4), we
also consider this more general situation.
Notation 7.1. Let i : R → Υn be a functor, and let T be a strongly saturated
class of morphisms in P(R) of small generation. Denote by i∗ : P(Υn ) → P(R) the
precomposition with the functor i; denote by i! : P(R) → P(Υn ) the left adjoint,
given by Kan extension along i; and denote by i∗ : P(R) → P(Υn ) the right adjoint,
given by right Kan extension along i.
We now wish to formulate conditions on (R, T, i) that will guarantee Axioms
(C.1-4) for the quasicategory C = T −1 P(R). We begin with the following trivial
observation.
Lemma 7.2. The quasicategory C = T −1 P(R) is strongly generated by the composite Υn → τ≤0 C → C.
It is now convenient to have a formulation of the troublesome Axiom (C.2) that
can be verified exclusively in the presheaf quasicategory P(R). To this end, we
introduce the following.
Definition 7.3. Suppose Z ∈ P(R). For some integer 0 ≤ k ≤ n, we say that a
morphism Z → Ck is degenerate if it factors through an inclusion Cj ֒→ Ck for
j < k; otherwise, we say that it is nondegenerate.
Proposition 7.4. For C = T −1 P(R) as above, Axiom (C.2) is equivalent to the
following condition.

ON THE UNICITY OF THE HOMOTOPY THEORY OF HIGHER CATEGORIES

19

(C.2-bis) There is a subset T0 ⊂ T that generates T as a strongly saturated
class for which the following condition holds. For any object W of R,
any functor i(W ) → Ck of Υn , any morphism U → V of T0 , and any
nondegenerate morphism V → Ck of P(R), the induced morphism
U ×Ck i(W ) → V ×Ck i(W )
lies in T .
Proof. For any T -local object X of P(R), a morphism Y → X represents an object
of (T −1 P(R))/X if and only if, for any morphism U → V of T0 , the square
Map(V, Y )

Map(U, Y )

Map(V, X)

Map(U, X).

is homotopy cartesian, since the horizontal map at the bottom is an equivalence.
For this, it suffices to show that the induced map on homotopy fibers over any
vertex of Map(V, X) is an equivalence. Unpacking this, we obtain the condition
that for any morphism V → X, the map
Map/X (V, Y ) → Map/X (U, Y )
is a weak equivalence. We therefore deduce that (T −1 P(R))/X may be exhibited as
−1
a localization TX
(P(R)/X ), where TX is the strongly saturated class generated by
the set of diagrams of the form
φ

U

V

X
in which φ ∈ T0 .
Now suppose η : Z → Ck a morphism of T −1 P(R). Since colimits are universal
in P(R) [32, § 6.1.1], the functor
P(R)/Ck → P(R)/Z
given by pullback along η preserves all colimits, and the universal property of
localizations guarantees that the composite
P(R)/Ck → P(R)/Z → TZ−1 (P(R)/Z ) ≃ (T −1 P(R))/Z
descends to a colimit-preserving functor
(T −1 P(R))/Ck ≃ TC−1
(P(R)/Ck ) → TZ−1 (P(R)/Z ) ≃ (T −1 P(R))/Z
k
(which then must also be given by the pullback along η) if and only if, for any

in which 0 ≤ k ≤ n and φ ∈ T0 , the induced morphism U ×Ck Z → V ×Ck Z lies in
T.
It is clear that it suffices to check this only for nondegenerate morphisms V → Ck .
It now remains only to show that it suffices to check this for objects Z among the
essential image of R. This follows from the fact that the class T is strongly saturated
and the fact that R generates P(R) under colimits.
Pr. 7.4 now suggests an approach to defining a strongly saturated class S of
morphisms of P(Υn ) such that the localization S −1 P(Υn ) will satisfy axioms (C.14); this will yield our first example of a homotopy theory of (∞, n)-categories.
Notation 7.5. We consider the quasicategory P(Υn ) and the Yoneda embedding
f : Υn ֒→ τ≤0 P(Υn ) ֒→ P(Υn ).
Let S00 denote the image of the finite set of morphisms of the same name as defined
in Not. 5.8, which also represent the morphisms that appeared in (C.3). Let S0 be
the smallest class of morphisms of P(Υn ), closed under isomorphism, containing
S00 , and closed under the operation X ×Ci (−) for all X ∈ Υn . One may check that
S0 has countably many isomorphism classes of maps and agrees with the essential
image of the class, also called S0 , introduced in Not. 5.8. Let S be the strongly
saturated class of morphisms of P(Υn ) generated by the class S0 .
Theorem 7.6. The quasicategory Cat(∞,n) := S −1 P(Υn ) satisfies axioms (C.1-4);
that is, it is a homotopy theory of (∞, n)-categories.
Proof. By construction, and Pr. 7.4, Cat(∞,n) satisfies axioms (C.1-3). Any quasicategory satisfying axiom (C.1) must be a localization of P(Υn ). By the above
proposition, any strongly saturated class of morphisms in P(Υn ) resulting in a localization satisfying axioms (C.2) and (C.3) must contain S, hence must be a further
localization of Cat(∞,n) . Therefore Cat(∞,n) also satisfies (C.4).
8. The Space of theories of (∞, n)-categories
Th. 7.6 implies in particular that the space Thy(∞,n) is nonempty (and thus
connected). We now compute the homotopy type of this space precisely. We begin
by computing the subcategory τ≤0 Cat(∞,n) of 0-truncated objects of Cat(∞,n) .
Lemma 8.1. The Yoneda embedding factors through a fully-faithful inclusion
Υn ֒→ τ≤0 Cat(∞,n) .
This induces a fully-faithful nerve functor
ν : Gauntn ֒→ τ≤0 Cat(∞,n) .
Proof. The 0-truncated objects of P(Υn ) consist precisely of those presheaves of
spaces taking values in the 0-truncated spaces, i.e. those presheaves which are
equivalent to ordinary set-valued presheaves on Υn . The 0-truncated objects of
Cat(∞,n) = S −1 P(Υn ) consist of precisely those 0-truncated objects of P(Υn ) which
are S-local. By Lm. 5.9, the nerve of every gaunt n-category is S-local, and so the
result follows.

Notation 8.2. Now let Υn = Gn be the globular category of cells and inductively
(k)
define Υn to be the full subcategory of Υn spanned by the set
X ∈ Υn

there exists a colimit diagram f : K ⊲ → Cat(∞,n)
such that f (+∞) ≃ X and f (K) ⊂ Υn(k−1)

.

(k)

That is, Υn ⊂ Υn consists of colimits, formed in Cat(∞,n) , of diagrams of objects
of

(k−1)
Υn
.
(k)

Proposition 8.3. The collection {Υn } forms an exhaustive filtration of Υn .
Proof. In any quasicategory, retractions of 0-truncated objects are the same as
retractions inside the ordinary category of 0-truncated objects. This follows as a
retract (in the sense of a weak retraction diagram [32, Df. 4.4.5.4]) of a 0-truncated
object is automatically 0-truncated, and moreover any strong retraction diagram
[32, Df. 4.4.5.4] of such objects factors essentially uniquely through the 0-truncated
(k)
subcategory. By [32, Pr. 4.4.5.13] it then follows that a retract of an object of Υn
(k+1)
(k)
is an object of Υn
. Thus the union ∪k Υn ⊆ Υn contains the cells and is closed
under retracts.
It now suffices to show that this union is closed under fiber products over cells.
To prove this, we induct on the statement:
(k)

(k+n+1)

for all X → Ci and Y → Ci .
• If X, Y ∈ Υn then X ×Ci Y ∈ Υn
Since Cat(∞,n) satisfies Axiom (C.2), the above statement for k = i implies the
statement for k = i + 1. The base case (k = 0) follows from the proof of Lm. 5.10,
which is essentially an induction argument using Axiom (C.3).
Corollary 8.4. The quasicategory Cat(∞,n) is generated under colimits by the cells
Ck ∈ Υn ; that is, the smallest subcategory of Cat(∞,n) containing the cells and closed
under colimits is Cat(∞,n) itself.
Proof. As Cat(∞,n) is strongly generated by Υn , it suffices to show that the representables are generated by the cells under colimits in Cat(∞,n) . This follows again
(k)

by induction on the filtration of Pr. 8.3: by definition Υn is generated by the cells
(k−1)
(0)
if Υn
is generated by them, and Υn = Gn consisting of precisely the cells, is
trivially generated by them.
Corollary 8.5. The cells detect equivalences in Cat(∞,n) , that is f : X → Y is
an equivalence in Cat(∞,n) if and only if it induces equivalences Map(Ck , X) →
Map(Ck , Y ) for all 0 ≤ k ≤ n.
Proof. Since Cat(∞,n) is a localization of P(Υn ), a map f : X → Y is an equivalence
in Cat(∞,n) if and only if it induces an equivalences of mapping spaces
Map(H, X) → Map(H, Y )
for every H ∈ Υn . In particular, an equivalence induces equivalences for H = Ck
for all 0 ≤ k ≤ n.
Conversely, suppose that f : X → Y induces equivalences of cellular mapping
spaces. Then we claim that it induces equivalences of mapping spaces for all H.
(k)
This follows from induction on the following statement using the filtration {Υn }:
(k)

• If H ∈ Υn , then Map(H, X) → Map(H, Y ) is an equivalence.

22

CLARK BARWICK AND CHRISTOPHER SCHOMMER-PRIES

The inductive statement for k = i follows the statement for k = i − 1, as H is a
(k−1)
colimit of objects of Υn
. The base case k = 0 is precisely the assumption that
f : X → Y induces equivalences of cellular mapping spaces.
Corollary 8.6. τ≤0 Cat(∞,n) ≃ Gauntn . In particular a presheaf of sets on Υn is
isomorphic to the nerve of a gaunt n-category if and only if it is S-local.
Proof. The nerve of a gaunt n-category is S-local (cf. Lm. 5.9). Conversely, for any
X ∈ τ≤0 Cat(∞,n) ⊆ Fun(Υop
n , Set), we may restrict to Gn to obtain a globular
set HX . For 0 ≤ j < i ≤ n, apply X to the unique nondegenerate i-cell µ : Ci →
Ci ∪Cj Ci connecting the initial and terminal vertices; this gives rise to the various
compositions
X(Ci ) ×X(Cj ) X(Ci ) ∼
= X(Ci ∪Cj Ci ) → X(Ci ).
By examining the maps
X(Ci ) ×X(Cj ) X(Ci ) ×X(Cj ) X(Ci ) ∼
= X(Ci ∪Cj Ci ∪Cj Ci ) → X(Ci )
corresponding to the unique nondegenerate i-cell
Ci → Ci ∪Cj Ci ∪Cj Ci
connecting the initial and terminal vertices, we find that these compositions are
associative, and by examining the maps X(Cj ) → X(Ci ) induced by the nondegenerate cell Ci → Cj , we find that these compositions are unital. From this we
deduce that HX forms a strict n-category. Finally, since X is local with respect
to Kk → Ck , it follows that HX is gaunt. Now map A → X, with A ∈ Υn induces a map A → νHX , and hence we have a map X → νHX in τ≤0 Cat(∞,n) . By
construction this is a cellular equivalence, whence X ≃ νHX .
Definition 8.7. For any nonnegative integer n, an n-categorical pair (C, F ) consists
of a reduced quasicategory C (Df. 6.6), along with an equivalence
F : τ≤0 C ≃ Gauntn .
When such an equivalence F exists, we shall say that the reduced quasicategory C
admits an n-categorical pair structure.
Remark 8.8. One can easily employ Lm. 4.6 to show that the space of n-categorical
pairs whose underlying quasicategory is fixed is a torsor under (Z/2)n .
Now write Aut(C) for the full sub-quasicategory of Fun(C, C) spanned by the
auto-equivalences.
Proposition 8.9. For any quasicategory C that admits an n-categorical pair structure, the quasicategory Aut(C) is equivalent to the (discrete) group (Z/2)n .
Proof. Let κ be a regular cardinal such that C is strongly generated by the κcompact 0-truncated objects (τ≤0 C)κ . We observe that the existence of an equivalence τ≤0 C ≃ Gauntn , Lm. 4.1, Lm. 4.6, and Cor. 4.8 guarantee that Aut((τ≤0 C)κ )
in Fun((τ≤0 C)κ , (τ≤0 C)κ ) is equivalent to the discrete group (Z/2)×n . It therefore
suffices to exhibit an equivalence of quasicategories Aut(C) ≃ Aut((τ≤0 C)κ ).
Clearly Aut(C) is a full sub-quasicategory of the the full sub-quasicategory
FunL (C, C) of Fun(C, C) spanned by those functors that preserve small colimits.

ON THE UNICITY OF THE HOMOTOPY THEORY OF HIGHER CATEGORIES

Since (τ≤0 C)κ strongly generates C, it follows from Lemma 6.3 that the inclusion
(τ≤0 C)κ ֒→ C induces a fully faithful functor
FunL (C, C) ֒→ Fun((τ≤0 C)κ , C).
Moreover, any auto-equivalence of C restricts to an auto-equivalence of τ≤0 C and
hence an autoequivalence of (τ≤0 C)κ . Thus restriction furnishes us with a fully
faithful functor from Aut(C) to Aut((τ≤0 C)κ ) ≃ (Z/2)n .
It remains to show that the restriction functor is essentially surjective. For this,
suppose (τ≤0 C)κ → (τ≤0 C)κ an auto-equivalence. One may form the left Kan extension Φ : C → C of the composite
φ : (τ≤0 C)κ → (τ≤0 C)κ ֒→ C
along the inclusion (τ≤0 C)κ ֒→ C. One sees immediately that Φ is an equivalence,
and moreover its restriction to (τ≤0 C)κ coincides with φ.
Remark 8.10. If C is a quasicategory that admits an n-categorical pair structure,
the choice of an equivalence F : τ≤0 C → Gauntn kills the auto-equivalences. That
is, the fiber of the induced functor
F ⋆ : Aut(C) → FunL (τ≤0 C, Gauntn )
over F is contractible.
Notation 8.11. For n-categorical pairs (C, F ) and (D, G), write FunL ((C, F ), (D, G))
for the fiber of the functor
FunL (C, D) → FunL (C, Gauntn )
over the object F ◦ τ≤0 ∈ FunL (C, Gauntn ).
Theorem 8.12. The Kan complex Thy(∞,n) of homotopy theories of (∞, n)-categories
is B(Z/2)n .
Proof. Cor. 8.6 provides an identification F : τ≤0 Cat(∞,n) ≃ Gauntn . Axiom (C.1)
ensures that Cat(∞,n) is strongly generated by Υn ⊆ Gauntn , since Υn is essentially
small, it follows that there exists a regular cardinal κ such that Υn ⊆ Gauntκn . (In
fact one may take κ = ω, but we will not need this precise bound.) It follows that
Cat(∞,n) is also strongly generated by Gauntκn (cf. [32, Pr. 4.3.2.8]). Thus Cat(∞,n)
admits an n-categorical pair structure. The result now follows from the results of
this section.
9. Presheaves of spaces as models for (∞, n)-categories
Many well-known examples of homotopy theories of (∞, n)-categories are exhibited as an accessible localizations of presheaves of spaces on smaller categories.
Consequently, in this section, we identify conditions on an ordinary category R and
a class T of morphisms of P(R) that will guarantee that the localization T −1 P(R)
is a homotopy theory of (∞, n)-categories.
Notation 9.1. Suppose R an ordinary category, and suppose i : R → Υn a functor.
Suppose T0 a set of morphisms of P(R), and write T for the strongly saturated class
of morphisms of P(R) it generates.
Theorem 9.2. Suppose that the following conditions are satisfied.
(R.1) i∗ (S0 ) ⊆ T .

24

CLARK BARWICK AND CHRISTOPHER SCHOMMER-PRIES

(R.2) i! (T0 ) ⊆ S.
(R.3) Any counit R → i∗ i! (R) = i∗ (i(R)) is in T for any R ∈ R.
(R.4) For each 0 ≤ k ≤ n, there exists an object Rk ∈ R such that i(Rk ) ∼
= Ck ∈
Υn .
Then i∗ : Cat(∞,n) → T −1 P(R) is an equivalence, and T −1 P(R) is a homotopy
theory of (∞, n)-categories.
Proof. Condition (R.1) implies both that i∗ carries T -local objects to S-local objects
and that we obtain an adjunction:
LT ◦ i∗ : S −1 P(Υn ) ⇄ T −1 P(R) : i∗ .
Similarly, condition (R.2) implies that i∗ carries S-local objects to T -local objects
and that we obtain a second adjunction:
LS ◦ i! : T −1 P(R) ⇄ S −1 P(Υn ) : i∗ .
Since i∗ sends S-local objects to T -local objects, i∗ ≃ LT ◦ i∗ when restricted to
the S-local objects of P(Υn ). Thus i∗ : P(Υn ) → P(R) restricts to a functor
i∗ : Cat(∞,n) = S −1 P(Υn ) → T −1 P(R),
that admits a left adjoint LS ◦ i! and a right adjoint i∗ .
Notice that i! (R) ∼
= i(R) in P(Υn ), where we have identified R and Υn with
their images under the Yoneda embedding in, respectively, P(R) and P(Υn ). Thus
by (R.3) the counit map applied to r ∈ R,
R → i∗ ◦ LS ◦ i! (R) ∼
= i∗ ◦ LS i(R) ∼
= i∗ i(R)
becomes an equivalence in T −1 P(R) (the last equality follows from Lm. 8.1, as the
image of i consists of S-local objects). The endofunctor i∗ ◦ LS ◦ i! : T −1 P(R) →
T −1 P(R) is a composite of left adjoints, hence commutes with colimits. Therefore,
as T −1 P(R) is strongly generated by R, the functor i∗ ◦ LS ◦ i! is determined by
its restriction to R. It is equivalent the left Kan extension of its restriction to R.
Consequently i∗ ◦ LS ◦ i! is equivalent to the identity functor.
On the other hand, for each X ∈ Cat(∞,n) , consider the other counit map X →
i∗ i∗ X. For each k, we have natural equivalences,
Map(Ck , i∗ i∗ X) ≃ Map(i(Rk ), i∗ i∗ X)
≃ Map(i∗ i(Rk ), i∗ X)
≃ Map(Rk , i∗ X)
≃ Map(i(Rk ), X) ≃ Map(Ck , X),
which follow from (R.3), (R.4), the identity i∗ (Rk ) ∼
= i(Rk ), and the fact that i∗ X
is T -local. By Cor. 8.5 this implies that the counit X → i∗ i∗ X is an equivalence.
Thus i∗ is a functor with both a left and right inverse, hence is itself an equivalence
of quasicategories.
Remark 9.3. Note that if the functor i : R → Υn is fully-faithful, then condition (R.3) is automatic. Note also that (R.3) and (R.4) together imply that the
presheaves i∗ (Ck ) on R are each T -equivalent to representables Rk .
Condition (R.1) appears to be the most difficult to verify in practice. Heuristically, it states that T contains enough morphisms. To verify it, it will be convenient
to subdivide it into two conditions.

ON THE UNICITY OF THE HOMOTOPY THEORY OF HIGHER CATEGORIES

Lemma 9.4. Condition (R.1) is implied by the conjunction of the following.
(R.1-bis(a)) i∗ (S00 ) ⊂ T .
(R.1-bis(b)) For any morphism U ′ → V ′ of T0 , and for any morphisms V ′ →
i∗ (Ci ) and H → Ci with H ∈ Υn , the pullback
U ′ ×i∗ (Ci ) i∗ H → V ′ ×i∗ Ci i∗ H
lies in T .
Proof. First, consider the subclass T ′ ⊂ T containing those morphisms U ′ → V ′ of
T such that for any nondegenerate morphisms V ′ → Ck and H → Ck , the pullback
U ′ ×Ck H → V ′ ×Ck H
lies in T . Since colimits in P(R) are universal, one deduces immediately that the
class T ′ is strongly saturated. Hence (R.1-bis(b)) implies that T ′ = T . Thus T is
closed under pullbacks along morphisms H → Ck and contains i∗ S00 (by (R.1bis(a))), hence contains all of i∗ S0 .
There are two main examples to which we shall apply Th. 9.2: Rezk’s model
of complete Segal Θn -spaces [§ 11] and the model of n-fold complete Segal spaces
[§ 12].
10. Strict n-categories as presheaves of sets
A category internal to an ordinary category D may be described as a simplicial
object in D, that is a D-valued presheaf C : ∆op → D, which satisfies the following
strong Segal conditions. For any nonnegative integer m and any integer 1 ≤ k ≤
m − 1, the following square is a pullback square:
C([m])

C({k, k + 1, . . . , m})

C({0, 1, . . . , k})

C({k}).

Thus a strict n-category consists of a presheaf of sets on the category ∆×n which
satisfies the Segal condition in each factor and further satisfies a globularity condition. Equivalently a strict n-category is a presheaf of sets on ∆×n which is local
with respect to the classes of maps Segal∆×n and Glob∆×n defined below.
Notation 10.1. Objects of ∆×n will be denoted m = ([mk ])k=1,...,n . Let
j : ∆×n → Fun((∆×n )op , Set)
denote the Yoneda embedding. Let
⊠ : Fun(∆op , Set) × Fun((∆×n−1 )op , Set) → Fun((∆×n )op , Set)
be the essentially unique functor that preserves colimits separately in each variable
and sends (j[k], j(m)) to j([k], m). Let Segal∆ denote the collection of maps that
corepresent the Segal squares:
Segal∆ = {j{0, 1, . . . , k} ∪j{k} j{k, k + 1, . . . , m} → j[m] | 1 ≤ k ≤ m − 1}
and inductively define
Segal∆×n = {Segal∆ ⊠ j(m) | m ∈ ∆×n−1 } ∪ {j[k] ⊠ Segal∆×n−1 | [k] ∈ ∆}.

26

CLARK BARWICK AND CHRISTOPHER SCHOMMER-PRIES

Moreover for each m ∈ ∆×n , let m = ([mj ])1≤j≤n be defined by the formula
[m j ] =

[0]
if there exists i ≤ j with [mi ] = [0], and
,
[mj ] else

and let
Glob∆×n = {j(m) → j(m) | m ∈ ∆×n }.
The presheaf underlying a strict n-category C will be called its nerve νC.
Strict n-categories may also be described as certain presheaves on the category
Θn , the opposite of Joyal’s category of n-disks [27].
Definition 10.2 ([8, Df. 3.1]). Let C be a small category. The wreath product ∆ ≀ C
is the category
• whose objects consist of tuples ([n]; c1 , . . . , cn ) where [n] ∈ ∆ and ci ∈ C,
and
• whose morphisms from ([m]; a1 , . . . , am ) to ([n]; b1 , . . . , bn ) consist of tuples
(φ; φij ), where φ : [m] → [n], and φij : ai → bj where 0 < i ≤ m, and
φ(i − 1) < j ≤ φ(i).
The category Θn is defined inductively as a wreath product: Θ1 = ∆, and Θn =
∆ ≀ Θn−1 . In particular this gives rise to embeddings σ : Θn−1 → Θn , given by
σ(o) = ([1]; o), and ι : ∆ → Θn given by ι([n]) = ([n]; ([0]), . . . , ([0])).
There is a fully-faithful embedding i : Θn ֒→ Catn as a dense subcategory [8,
Th. 3.7]. The image under i of ([m]; a1 , . . . , am ) may be described inductively as
the following colimit:
i([m]; o1 , . . . , om ) = σ(i(o1 )) ∪C0 σ(i(o2 )) ∪C0 · · · ∪C0 σ(i(om )).
This colimit, taken in Catn , is a series of pushouts in which C0 is embedded into
σ(i(ok )) via ⊤ and into σ(i(ok+1 )) via ⊥ as described after Ex. 2.2. There is no
possible confusion by the meaning of σ, as i(σ(o)) = σ(i(o)) for all o ∈ Θn−1 .
As i is dense, the corresponding nerve functor ν : Catn → Fun(Θop
n , Set) is fullyfaithful. The essential image consists of precisely those presheaves which are local
with respect to the class of maps SegalΘn defined inductively to be the union of
σSegalΘn−1 and the following:
j({0, . . . , k}; o1 , . . . , ok ) ∪j({k}) j({k, . . . , m}; ok+1 , . . . , om ) → j([m]; o1 , . . . , om )
0 ≤ k ≤ m,

oi ∈ Θn−1

We will call this latter class SeΘn for later reference.
The category Θn consists of gaunt n-categories and without much difficulty one
may check that it is a full subcategory of Υn . Thus Υn may equivalently be described
as the smallest subcategory of Gauntn containing Θn which is closed under retracts
and fiber products over cells.
Notation 10.3. Let K denote the simplicial set
∆3 ∪(∆

{0,2}

⊔∆{1,3} )

(∆0 ⊔ ∆0 )

obtained by contracting two edges in the three simplex.

.

ON THE UNICITY OF THE HOMOTOPY THEORY OF HIGHER CATEGORIES

Rezk observed [38, § 10] that K detects equivalences in nerves of categories, and
consequently it may be used to formulate his completeness criterion. We shall use
it to identify the gaunt n-categories. To this end set
Comp∆ = {K → j[0]}
Comp∆×n = {Comp∆ ⊠ j(0)} ∪ {j[k] ⊠ Comp∆×n−1 }
CompΘn = ι! Comp∆ ∪ σ! CompΘn−1 .
where
op
op
ι! : Fun(∆op , Set) → Fun(Θop
n , Set) and σ! : Fun(Θn−1 , Set) → Fun(Θn , Set)

are given by left Kan extension along ι and σ, respectively.
Corollary 10.4. A presheaf of sets on ∆×n is isomorphic to the nerve of a gaunt
n-category if and only if it is local with respect to the classes Segal∆×n , Glob∆×n ,
and Comp∆×n . A presheaf of sets on Θn is isomorphic to the nerve of a gaunt
n-category if and only if it is local with respect to the classes SegalΘn and CompΘn .
Proof. Being local with respect Segal∆×n and Glob∆×n (or to SegalΘn for Θn presheaves) implies that the presheaf is the nerve of a strict n-category. Such
an n-category is gaunt if and only if it is local with respect to the morphisms
σ k (E) → σ k (C0 ). This last follows from locality with respect to Comp∆×n (or,
respectively, with respect to CompΘn ) because the square
[1] ⊔ [1]

i0,2 ⊔ i1,3

[0] ⊔ [0]

[3]

E

is a pushout square of strict n-categories.
The description of Θn as an iterated wreath product gives rise to a canonical
functor δn : ∆×n → Θn , described in [8, Df. 3.8], which sends [k1 ] × [k2 ] × · · · × [kn ]
to the object
([kn ]; i∆×(n−1) ([k1 ] × · · · × [kn−1 ]), . . . , i∆×(n−1) ([k1 ] × · · · × [kn−1 ])).
kn times

This object may be thought of as generated by a k1 × k2 × · · · × kn grid of cells. If X
is a strict n-category then its nerve ν∆×n X in Fun((∆×n )op , Set) is obtained by the
formula δn∗ νΘn X, where νΘn is the nerve induced from the inclusion Θn → Catn [8,
Pr. 3.9, Rk. 3.12].
Proposition 10.5. Joyal’s category Θn is the smallest full subcategory of Gauntn
containing the grids (the full subcategory of Θn spanned by the image of δn ) and
closed under retracts. Furthermore, the morphisms in the set SegalΘn may be obtained as retracts of the set (δn )! (Segal∆×n ).
Proof. Both statements follow by induction. First note that Θn itself is closed under
retracts [8, Pr. 3.14]. In the base case, the category Θ1 = ∆ consists of precisely
the grids, and the sets of morphisms agree SegalΘ1 = Segal∆ . Now assume, by
induction, that every object of o ∈ Θn−1 is the retract of a grid δn (mo ), for some

28

CLARK BARWICK AND CHRISTOPHER SCHOMMER-PRIES

object mo = [mo1 ]×· · ·×[mon−1 ] ∈ ∆×n . In fact, given any finite collection of objects
{oi ∈ Θn−1 } they may be obtained as the retract of a single grid. This grid may
be obtained as the image of k = [k1 ] × · · · × [kn−1 ], where kj is the maximum of
the collection {moj i }. It now follows easily that the object ([n]; o1 , . . . , oi ) ∈ Θn is a
retract of the grid coming from the object [n] × k.
To prove the second statement we note that there are two types of maps in
SegalΘn , those in σ! (SegalΘn−1 ) and the maps
j({0, . . . , k}; o1 , . . . , ok ) ∪j({k}) j({k, . . . , m}; ok+1 , . . . , om ) → j([m]; o1 , . . . , om )
for 0 ≤ k ≤ m and oi ∈ Θn−1 . This later map is a retract of the image under (δn )!
of the map
j{0, 1, . . . , k} ∪j{k} j{k, . . . , m} → j[m] ⊠ j(m)
which is a map in Segal∆×n . Here m is such that ({0, . . . , k}; o1 , . . . , ok ) is the
retract of the grid corresponding to [k] × m.
The former class of morphisms in SegalΘn , those in σ! (SegalΘn−1 ), are also retracts on elements in Segal∆×n . Specifically, if σ! (f ) ∈ σ! (SegalΘn−1 ), then by induction f is the retract of (δn−1 )! (g) for some g ∈ Segal∆×n−1 . One may then readily
check that σ(f ) is the retract of j[1] ⊠ g ∈ Segal∆×n .
11. Rezk’s complete Segal Θn -spaces form a homotopy theory of
(∞, n)-categories
Here we consider Joyal’s full subcategory Θn of Catn [27, 7, 8]; write i : Θn → Υn
for the inclusion functor. Rezk [38, 11.4] identifies the set of morphisms Tn,∞ of
P(Θn ) consisting of the union of SegalΘn and CompΘn 3. Let us write TΘn for the
saturated class generated by Tn,∞ , and let us write CSS(Θn ) for the localization
P(Θn ). We now show that CSS(Θn ) is a homotopy theory of (∞, n)-categories.
TΘ−1
n
Remark 11.1. It follows from [32, A.3.7.3] that CSS(Θn ) is canonically equivalent to
the simplicial nerve of the cofibrant-fibrant objects in the simplicial model category
Θn Sp∞ considered by Rezk — i.e., the left Bousfield localization of the injective
model category of simplicial presheaves on Θn with respect to the set Tn,∞ .
Lemma 11.2. The saturated class TΘn contains the set i∗ (S00 ).
Proof. The set S00 consists of the union of four subsets of maps, corresponding
to the four families of fundamental pushouts of types (a), (b), (c), and (d) in
Axiom (C.3). The second and last subsets corresponding to the (b) and (d) families
pullback to morphisms which are contained in the generating set of TΘn . Thus it
remains to prove the that the same holds for the remaining families (a) and (c). In
particular, we wish to show that for each 0 ≤ i ≤ n, each 0 ≤ j, k ≤ n − i, and
every nondegenerate morphism Ci+j → Ci and Ci+k → Ci , the natural morphism
(11.2.1) f (Ci+j ∪Ci Ci+k )) ∪f (σ

i+1

(Cj−1 ×Ck−1 ))

(f (Ci+k ∪Ci Ci+j )
→ f (Ci+j ×Ci Ci+k ),

3Rezk use a slightly different generating set based on the full decomposition of [n] as the union

[1] ∪[0] [1] ∪[0] · · · ∪[0] [1].
Both Rezk’s set of generators and the union SegalΘn ∪ CompΘn are readily seen to produce the
same saturated class TΘn . We find it slightly more convenient to use the later class of generators.

ON THE UNICITY OF THE HOMOTOPY THEORY OF HIGHER CATEGORIES

29

is contained in TΘn where the pushout is formed as in Not. 5.8.
In fact a stronger statement holds (cf. [38, Pr. 4.9]). For each object o ∈ Θn we
have a natural bijection of sets
hom(o, Ci+j ×C Ci+k ) ∼
= hom(o, Ci+j ∪Ci Ci+k ))∪hom(o,Ci+m ) hom(o, Ci+k ∪Ci Ci+j ).
i

Thus Eq. 11.2.1 is in fact an equivalence in the presheaf category P(Θn ). In particular the family (c) pulls back to a family of equivalences, which are hence contained in
TΘn . An virtually identical argument applies the the family (a), which also consists
of morphisms pulling back to equivalences of presheaves.
The functor σ : Θn−1 → Θn gives rise to a functor σ! : P(Θn−1 ) → P(Θn ), left
adjoint to σ ∗ . The classes SegalΘn and CompΘn are defined inductively using the
1-categorical analog of σ! , but may also be defined using σ! . We therefore collect
some relevant properties of this functor in the next two lemmas.
Lemma 11.3. The functor σ! preserves both pushouts and pullbacks, sends TΘn−1 local objects to TΘn -local objects, and satisfies σ! (TΘn−1 ) ⊆ TΘn .
Proof. The functor σ! is a left adjoint, hence it preserves all colimits in P(Θn ), in
particular pushouts. Moreover, σ! sends the generators of TΘn−1 to generators of
TΘn . Together these imply the containment σ! (TΘn−1 ) ⊆ TΘn . Direct computations,
which we leave to the reader, show that σ! sends TΘn−1 -local objects to TΘn -local
objects and that the following formula holds,
Map(ok , X ×Y Z).

hom(([n]; o1 , . . . , on ), σ(X ×Y Z)) =
ik :[n]→[1]
0≤k≤n+1

where ik : [n] → [1] maps i ∈ [n] to 0 ∈ [1] if i < k and to 1 ∈ [1] otherwise. In the
above formula when k = 0 or n + 1 the space Map(ok , X ×Y Z) is interpreted as a
singleton space. From this it follows that σ preserves fiber products.
The following observation is clear from the definition of σ and the morphisms in
Θn .
Lemma 11.4. Suppose that V ∈ Θn is of the form V ∼
= σ(W ) for some W ∈ Θn−1 .
Suppose that f : V → Ci is nondegenerate and i > 0. Then f = σ(g) for a unique
nondegenerate g : W → Ci−1 .
More generally, the Θ-construction gives rise, for each [m] ∈ ∆, to functors
σ [m] : Θ×m
n−1 → Θn
(o1 , . . . , om ) → ([m]; o1 , . . . , om ).
The case σ [1] = σ has just been considered, and as in that case we obtain functors
[m]

σ!

: P(Θn−1 )×m → P(Θn )

by left Kan extension in each varaible. These functors were also considered by Rezk
[m]
[38, § 4.4], and we adopt a similar notation: σ! (X1 , . . . , Xm ) = ([m]; X1 , . . . , Xm ).
Lemma 11.5. Let b1 , . . . , bp be elements of P(Θn−1 ), and let 0 ≤ r ≤ s ≤ p. Let
A and B be defined as follows:
{0,...,s}

A = σ!

Then the natural map A → B is in TΘn .
Proof. This follows from [38, Pr. 6.4], but the proof given there (even in the corrected version) relies on the false proposition [38, Pr. 2.19]. However it is straightforward to supply an alternate proof (along the lines of [38, Pr. 5.3]). First note
that if each of the bi were a representable presheaf, then the map A → B may
be written as a pushout of the generating morphism Tn,∞ , hence is manifestly an
element of TΘn (we leave this as an exercise). The general case, however, reduces
to this case as every presheaf is (canonically) a colimit of representables, the func[ℓ]
tors σ! commute with these colimits separately in each variable, and TΘn , being a
saturated class, is closed under colimits.
Notation 11.6. We now define three additional classes of morphisms of P(Θn ).
Let Ja be the set of all morphisms H → Ci (0 ≤ i ≤ n) of Υn ; let Jb be the set of
all nondegenerate morphisms H → Ci (0 ≤ i ≤ n) of Θn ; and let Jc be set of all
inclusions Cj ֒→ Ci (0 ≤ j ≤ i ≤ n) of Gn . Now, for x ∈ {a, b, c}, set:
(x)
TΘn :=

[f : U → V ] ∈ TΘn

for any [H → Ci ] ∈ Jx and [V → Ci ] ∈ P(Θn ),
one has f ×Ci νH ∈ TΘn
(x)

Lemma 11.7. Each of the three classes TΘn (x ∈ {a, b, c}) is a strongly saturated
class.
Proof. As colimits are universal in P(Θn ), the functors (−) ×Ci νH preserves all
small colimits. Thus the class [(−) ×Ci νH]−1 (TΘn ) is a saturated class in P(Θn ).
Taking appropriate intersections of these classes and TΘn yields the three classes in
question.
We aim to show that the quasicategory CSS(Θn ) is a homotopy theory of (∞, n)categories. For this we need to prove Axioms (R.1-4) of Th. 9.2. The most difficult
property, (R.1), would follow from Lm. 9.4 and Lm. 11.2 if we also knew the identity
(a)
(a)
TΘn = TΘn . As these are saturated classes and TΘn ⊆ TΘn , it is enough to show
(a)

that the generators SegalΘn and CompΘn of TΘn are contained in TΘn . We will ultimately prove this by an inductive argument, but first we need some preliminaries.
First, we note the following.
(c)

Lemma 11.8. One has TΘn = TΘn .
Proof. By Lm. 11.7, it is enough to check that the generators of SegalΘn and
(c)
CompΘn of TΘn are contained in TΘn . For that assume that [U → V ] is a generator of TΘn and let Cj ֒→ Ci be an inclusion. We wish to demonstrate that for
all V → Ci we have that
(11.8.1)

U ×Ci Cj → V ×Ci Cj

is in TΘn . Recall that
CompΘn = ι! Comp∆ ∪ σ! CompΘn−1

and SegalΘn = SegalΘn ∪ σ! SegalΘn−1 .

There are several cases:
(a) i = j. In this trivial case (11.8.1) reduces to [U → V ] ∈ TΘn .

ON THE UNICITY OF THE HOMOTOPY THEORY OF HIGHER CATEGORIES

31

(b) The morphism V → Ci factors as V → C0 → Ci . In this case the fiber
product Cj ×Ci C0 is either C0 or empty. In the latter case (11.8.1) is an
isomorphism, and in the former case it is [U → V ] ∈ TΘn . Notice that this
case covers ι! Comp∆ .
(c) j = 0 < i and the map V → Ci does not factor through C0 . In this case it
follows that [U → V ] is not in ι! Comp∆ , and hence
V = ([m]; o1 , ..., om )
is representable with m = 0. Moreover the map
V → Ci = ([1]; Ci−1 )
consists of a surjective map [m] → [1] (which specifies a unique 0 < k ≤ m;
the inverse image of 0 ∈ [1] consists of all elements strictly less than k)
together with map ok → Ci−1 . A direct calculation shows that in this
situation (11.8.1) is either an isomorphism or a generator of TΘn .
(d) 0 < j ≤ i, the map
[U → V ] ∈ σ! CompΘn−1 ∪ σ! SegalΘn−1
is a suspension, and the map V → Ci does not factor through C0 . It follows
that V → Ci is the suspension of a map. This case then follows by induction
and Lm. 11.3.
(e) The final case is when 0 < j < i, the map [U → V ] ∈ SeΘn is not a
suspension, nor in CompΘn , and the map V → Ci does not factor through
C0 . In this case (11.8.1) is a map of the form described in Lm. 11.5.
Remark. We would like to extend our gratitude to Charles Rezk for finding a
critical gap in an earlier preprint version of the above proof. Correcting this lead
us to restructure many of the arguments in this section.
(b)

Armed with this, we now reduce the problem to verifying that TΘn = TΘn .
(a)

(b)

Lemma 11.9. If TΘn coincides with TΘn , then so does the class TΘn .
Proof. First note that as Θn strongly generates P(Θn ), and TΘn is strongly saturated, it is enough to consider H ∈ Θn representable. Let f : U → V be a morphism
in TΘn , let V → Ci be given, and let H → Ci be arbitrary. There exists a unique
factorization H → Ck ֒→ Ci , with H → Ck nondegenerate. Consider the following
diagram of pullbacks in P(Θn ):
U ′′

U′

U
f

V ′′

V′

V

H

Ck

Ci
(b)

(c)

Since TΘn = TΘn , we have [U ′ → V ′ ] ∈ TΘn , and if TΘn = TΘn , then we also have
[U ′′ → V ′′ ] ∈ TΘn , as desired.
Lemma 11.10. For each x ∈ {a, b}, we have
(x)

T Θn =

[f : U → V ] ∈ TΘn

for any [H → Ci ] ∈ Jx and any nondegenerate
[V → Ci ] ∈ P(Θn ), one has f ×Ci νH ∈ TΘn

32

CLARK BARWICK AND CHRISTOPHER SCHOMMER-PRIES

In other words, to verify that f : U → V is in one of these classes, it suffices to
consider only those fiber products f ×Ci νH with V → Ci nondegenerate.
Proof. Let us focus on the case x = a. Let f : U → V be in class given on the
(a)
right-hand side of the asserted identity. We wish to show that f ∈ TΘn , that is for
any pair of morphism H → Ci and V → Ci we have
U ′ = U ×Ci H → V ×Ci H = V ′
is in TΘn . This follows as there exists a factorization V → Ck → Ci and a diagram
of pullbacks:
U′

V′

H′

H

U

V

Ck

Ci
(b)

such that V → Ck is nondegenerate. The analogous result for TΘn follows by the
same argument and the observation that H ′ → Ck is nondegenerate if H → Ci is
such.
(b)

Now we settle an important first case of the equality TΘn = TΘn .
Lemma 11.11. Let [U → V ] ∈ SegalΘn be a morphism that is not contained
in σ! (SegalΘn−1 ). Let V → Ci be nondegenerate, and let [H → Ci ] ∈ Jb be a
nondegenerate map in Θn . Then the morphism U ×Ci H → V ×Ci H is contained
in TΘn .
Proof. For the special case i = 0, a more general version of this statement was
proven by Rezk [38, Pr. 6.6] and forms one of the cornerstone results of that work.
Our current proof builds on Rezk’s ideas.
The fundamental argument is to construct a category Q along with a functorial
assignment of commuting squares
Aα

U ×Ci H

≀
Bα

V ×Ci H

for each α ∈ Q. This assignment is required to satisfy a host of conditions.
First, each of the functors A, B : Q → P(Θn ) is required to factor through
τ≤0 P(Θn ), the category of 0-truncated objects. The 0-truncated objects of P(Θn )
consist precisely of those presheaves of spaces taking values in the homotopically
discrete spaces. There is no harm regarding such objects simply as ordinary setvalued presheaves, and we will do so freely.
Second, we require that for each α ∈ Q the natural morphism Aα → Bα is in the
class TΘn . As TΘn is saturated, this second condition implies that the natural map
colimQ A → colimQ B is also in TΘn , where these colimits are taken in the quasicategory P(Θn ) (hence are equivalently homotopy colimits for a levelwise model
structure on simplical preseheaves, see Rk. 11.1).
Third and last, we require that the natural maps colimQ A → U ×Ci H and
colimQ B → V ×Ci H are equivalences in P(Θn ) (i.e. levelwise weak equivalences

ON THE UNICITY OF THE HOMOTOPY THEORY OF HIGHER CATEGORIES

33

of space-valued presheaves). If all of the above properties hold, then we obtain a
natural commuting square
colimQ A

≃

U ×Ci H

≀
colimQ B

≃

V ×Ci H

in which the indicated morphisms are in the class TΘn . As this class is saturated
it follows that U ×Ci H → V ×Ci H is also in this class. Thus if such a Q and
associated functors can be produced, we will have completed the proof.
However, the construction of a Q, A, and B demonstrably satisfying the above
properties appears to be somewhat delicate. In the case i = 0 the original published
proof [38, Pr. 6.6] was incorrect, and a corrected proof has been supplied by Rezk
in [39, Pr. 2.1]. At this point we deviate from Rezk’s treatment. Specifically our
category Q and associated functors will differ from his. We will focus on the more
complicated case i > 0, and leave the necessary simplifications in the case i = 0 to
the reader (or simply refer the reader to [38, Pr. 6.6] ).
Under the assumptions of the statement of the lemma we have the following
identifications of presheaves:
U = j({0, . . . , k}; o1 , . . . , ok ) ∪j({k}) j({k, k + 1, . . . , m}; ok+1 , . . . , om )
V = j([m]; o1 , . . . , om )
H = j([n]; u1 , . . . , un )
where 0 ≤ k ≤ m and oα , uβ ∈ Θn−1 are given. If i > 0, then the i-cell is the
representable presheaf j([1]; Ci−1 ). A nondegenerate map V → Ci includes a nondegenerate map f : [m] → [1], and likewise a nondegenerate map H → Ci includes
a nondegenerate map g : [n] → [1]. Let m′ be the fiber over 0 ∈ [1], and let m′′ be
the fiber over 1. Then [m] = [m′ ] · [m′′ ] is the ordered concatenation of [m′ ] and
[m′′ ]. Similarly [n] = [n′ ] · [n′′ ] is the ordered concatenation of the preimages of 0
and 1 under g.
Let δ = (δ ′ , δ ′′ ) : [p] → [m] ×[1] [n] be a map which is an inclusion. There is
a unique −1 ≤ r ≤ p such that under the composite [p] → [m] ×[1] [n] → [1], an
element s maps to 0 if and only if s ≤ r (hence maps to 1 if and only if s > r).
[p]
Associated to δ we have a subobject Cδ of V ×Ci H, of the form Cδ = σ! (c1 , . . . , cp ),
where cℓ is given by the following formula:
oα ×
δ ′ (ℓ−1)<α≤δ ′ (ℓ)

be especially useful in understanding the combinatorics of these subobjects.

δ : [p] → [m] ×[1] [n].
As subobjects of V ×Ci H, the Cδ are naturally arranged into a poset. Let W
denote the disjoint union of all the maximal elements of this poset. Let B• denote
ˇ
the simplicial Cech
nerve associated to the morphism W → V ×Ci H. Each layer of
B• consists of a disjoint union of certain Cδ . The map W → V ×Ci H is a surjective
map of set-valued presheaves. It follows that it is also an effective epimorphism
in the ∞-topos P(Θn ), and hence [32, Cor. 6.2.3.5] the (homotopy) colimit of the
simplcial diagram B• is equivalent to V ×Ci H. We set Q = ∆ and B = B• .
We define A• to be the fiber product of B• with U ×Ci H over V ×Ci H. Because
colimits in ∞-topoi are universal, we have
colim A ≃ colim B ×(V ×Ci H) (U ×Ci H)
Q

Q

≃ colim B• ×(V ×Ci H) (U ×Ci H)
∆

≃ U ×Ci H.
Thus all that remains is to show that the natural transformation A• → B• is
levelwise in TΘn .
As each layer of B• is a disjoint union of certain Cδ , it is sufficient to show that
the map
Cδ ×(V ×Ci H) (U ×Ci H) → Cδ
is in TΘ for each Cδ . As in the previous construction, there exist unique 0 ≤ r ≤
s ≤ p such that δ ′ (t) < k if and only if t < r, and k < δ ′ (t) if and only if s < t. The
interval {r, . . . , s} ⊂ [p] is precisely the preimage of {k} under δ ′ . We then have
Cδ ×(V ×Ci H) (U ×Ci H)

and so the desired result follows from Lm. 11.5.
Remark 11.12. It is possible to give an alternative proof of Lm. 11.11 which builds
directly on Rezk’s proof in the case i = 0. Let Q be Rezk’s category Qm,n as defined

ON THE UNICITY OF THE HOMOTOPY THEORY OF HIGHER CATEGORIES

35

in [39], and following Rezk define functors A(i=0) and B (i=0) as the objects
(i=0)

Aδ

:= V(δ1 ,δ2 )−1 (M×N ) (D1 , . . . , Dp ),

(i=0)
Bδ

:= V [p](D1 , . . . , Dp ),

and

where we are also using the notation of [39]. Then these choices satisfy the requisite
properties for the case i = 0, the most difficult being [39, Pr. 2.3].
For general i, notice that we have inclusions of subobjects
V ×Ci H ⊆ V × H,
U ×Ci H ⊆ U × H.
We may define Aδ and Bδ as pullbacks
(i=0)

Aδ = Aδ
Bδ =

(i=0)
Bδ

×(U×H) (U ×Ci H), and
×(V ×H) (V ×Ci H).

Since colimits in ∞-topoi are universal we have
colim A ≃ colim A(i=0) ×(U×H) (U ×Ci H) ≃ U ×Ci H,
Q

Q

colim B ≃ colim B (i=0) ×(V ×H) (V ×Ci H) ≃ V ×Ci H,

and so all that remains is to verify that Aδ → Bδ is indeed in TΘn . This can be
[ℓ]
accomplished by explicitly computing Aδ and Bδ in terms of the functors σ! and
invoking Lm. 11.5.
We may now complete the proof of (R.1) for complete Segal Θn -spaces.
Theorem 11.13. The triple (Θn , TΘn , i) satisfies axiom (R.1), namely i∗ (S) ⊂
T Θn .
(b)

Proof. By Lm. 11.9, it is enough to show that the strongly saturated classes TΘn
contains the generating sets SegalΘn and CompΘn . By Lm. 11.10, it suffices to
show that for any [U → V ] ∈ SegalΘn ∪ CompΘn , any nondegenerate morphism
[H → Ci ] ∈ Jb , and any nondegenerate morphism V → Ci of P(Θn ), we must show
that
U ′ = U ×Ci νH → V ×Ci νH = V ′
is contained in TΘn . Observe the following:
• If [U → V ] ∈ SegalΘn is not in the image of σ! , then U → V is contained in
(b)
TΘn by Lm. 11.11.
• If [U → V ] ∈ CompΘn is not in the image of σ! , then V = C0 , and the only
nondegenerate map V → Ci occurs when i = 0. In this case U → V is in
(b)
TΘn by [38, Pr. 6.1].
Thus we may restrict our attention to those generators U → V that lie in the image
of σ! . We proceed by induction. When n = 1, the set of generators in the image of
σ! is empty.
Assume that
(c)
(b)
(a)
TΘn−1 = TΘn−1 = TΘn−1 = TΘn−1 ,
and let U → V be an element of SegalΘn ∪ CompΘn that lies in the image of σ! .
Now note that if Ci = C0 , then U ′ → V ′ lies in TΘn , again by [38, Pr. 6.1]. If i = 0,
then by Lm. 11.4, the map V → Ci is also in the image of σ! . In this case, if we have

36

CLARK BARWICK AND CHRISTOPHER SCHOMMER-PRIES

a factorization H → C0 → Ci (which, since H → Ci is nondegenerate, can only
happen if H = C0 ), then U ′ → V ′ is an equivalence (as both are empty). Hence it
U → V lies in TΘn .
This leaves the final case, where both [U → V ] and [V → Ci ] lie in the image
of σ! , and [H → Ci ] is nondegenerate with H = j([m]; o1 , . . . , om ) = C0 , for some
m ≥ 1, oi ∈ Θn−1 . The nondegenerate map H → Ci = ([1]; Ci−1 ) is given explicitly
by the following data (see also the proof of Lm. 11.3): a map ik : [m] → [1] for some
1 ≤ k ≤ m such that ik (i) = 0 if i < k and ik (i) = 1 otherwise, together with a
single (nondegenerate) map ok → Ci−1 . In this case we may explicitly compute the
pullback
U ′ = U ×Ci H → V ×Ci H = V ′
and deduce that it is contained in the class TΘn .
[1]
As [U → V ] is in the image of σ! , it is of the form ([1]; U ′′ ) → ([1]; V ′′ ) for some
′′
′′
[U → V ] in SegalΘn−1 . The pullback is then given explicitly as:
U ′ = ([m];o1 , . . . , ok ×Ci−1 U ′′ , ok+1 , . . . , om )
→ ([m]; o1 , . . . , ok ×Ci−1 V ′′ , ok+1 , . . . , om ) = V ′ .
This map arrises as the right-most vertical map in the following (oddly drawn)
commuting square:

j([k − 1]; o1 , . . . , ok−1 ) ∪j({k−1}) ({k − 1, k}; ok ×Ci−1 U ′′ ) ∪j({k}) j({k, . . . , m}; ok+1 , . . . , om )
([m]; o1 , . . . , ok ×Ci−1 U ′′ , ok+1 , . . . , om )

([m]; o1 , o2 , . . . , ok ×Ci−1 V ′′ , ok+1 , . . . , om )
j([k − 1]; o1 , . . . , ok−1 ) ∪j({k−1}) ({k − 1, k}; ok ×Ci−1 V ′′ ) ∪j({k}) j({k, . . . , m}; ok+1 , . . . , om )

The left-most vertical map is a pushout of identities and (by induction) a map
in σ! (TΘn−1 ). Thus by Lm. 11.3 it is contained in TΘn . Both horizontal maps are
contained in TΘn by [38, Pr. 6.4], whence the right-most vertical map [U ′ → V ′ ] is
also contained in TΘn , as desired.
Lemma 11.14. The triple (Θn , TΘn , i) satisfies axiom (R.2), namely i! (TΘn ) ⊆ S.
Proof. As i! commutes with colimits, to show that i! (TΘn ) ⊆ S it is sufficient to
show this property for a subset which strongly generates the class TΘn . The maps
in CompΘn are clearly mapped into S. This leaves the maps SegalΘn . We now write
S = Sn and induct on n. When n = 0, one has Υ0 = Θ0 = pt.
Assume that i! (TΘn−1 ) ⊆ Sn−1 . The suspension functor σ! : P(Υn−1 ) → P(Υn )
preserves colimits and sends the generators Sn−1 into Sn . Hence the suspensions of
maps in i! (TΘn−1 ) are in Sn . Moreover, by construction the image under i! of the
following map
j({0, 1}; Ci ) ∪j({1}) j({1, 2}; Ci ) → j({0, 1, 2}; Ci , Ci )

ON THE UNICITY OF THE HOMOTOPY THEORY OF HIGHER CATEGORIES

37

is in Sn for all cells Ci . By induction, it follows that all the Segal generators are
mapped into Sn except possibly the following
(11.14.1)

j({0, . . . , k}; o1 , . . . , ok )∪j({k}) j({k, . . . , m}; ok+1 , . . . , om )
→ j({0, . . . , m}; o1 , . . . , om )

where oi ∈ Θn−1 . To show that i! maps the above morphism to a morphism in Sn ,
we observe that the above map may be rewritten as follows. The source may be
written as
j({0, . . . , k}; o1 , . . . , ok ) ×j({k−1,k};C0 ) j({k − 1, k}; C0 ) ∪j({k}) j({k, k + 1}; C0 )
×j({k,k+1};C0 ) j({k, k + 1, m}; ok+1 , . . . , om )
while the target is
j({0, . . . , k}; o1 , . . . , ok ) ×j({k−1,k};C0 ) j({k − 1, k, k + 1}; C0 , C0 )
×j({k,k+1};C0 ) j({k, k + 1, m}; ok+1 , . . . , om ).
Schematically then, the map of (11.14.1) is of the form
A ×C1 U ×C1 B → A ×C1 V ×C1 B
for U → V in S and A, B ∈ Υn . By property (C.2) of Cat(∞,n) (cf. also Pr. 7.4) it
follows that (11.14.1) lies in Sn also.
Theorem 11.15. The triple (Θn , TΘn , i) satisfies the axioms (R.1-4); The quasicategory CSS(Θn ) of complete Segal Θn -spaces is a homotopy theory of (∞, n)categories.
Proof. Condition (R.4) is clear, and the functor i : Θn → Υn is a fully-faithful
inclusion, hence (R.3) is automatically satisfied. Conditions (R.1) and (R.2) follow
from Th. 11.13 and Lm. 11.14.
Remark 11.16. From the above theorem and Th. 8.12 it follows that the automorphism group of the quasicategory CSS(Θn ) is the discrete group (Z/2)n . A more
direct proof of this fact, based on computing the automorphisms of the category
Θn , has recently appeared in [1].
12. n-Fold complete Segal spaces are a homotopy theory of
(∞, n)-categories
We give the iterative construction of the quasicategory CSS(∆×n ) of n-fold complete Segal spaces, following [2] and [33, § 1], and we show that CSS(∆×n ) is a
homotopy theory of (∞, n)-categories.
Definition 12.1 ([2]). Let CSS(∆0 ) be the quasicategory S of Kan simplicial sets.
Suppose now that n is a positive integer; assume that both a presentable quasicategory CSS(∆×n−1 ) and a fully faithful functor
cn−1 : CSS(∆0 ) ֒→ CSS(∆×n−1 )
that preserves all small colimits have been constructed. Let us call a simplicial
object X : N∆op → CSS(∆×n−1 ) an n-fold Segal space if it satisfies the following
pair of conditions.
(B.1) The object X0 lies in the essential image of cn−1 .

38

(B.2) For any integers 0 < k < m, the object Xm is exhibited as the limit of the
diagram
X({0, 1, . . . , k}) → X({k}) ← X({k, k + 1, . . . , m}).
Now for any n-fold Segal space X, one may apply the right adjoint to the functor
cn−1 objectwise to X to obtain a simplicial space ι1 X. Let us call X an n-fold
complete Segal space if it satisfies the following additional condition.
(B.3) The Kan complex (ι1 X)0 is exhibited as the limit of the composite functor
ι X

op 1
∆op
−→ CSS0 ,
/NE → ∆

where the category E is as in Ex. 2.2. Denote by CSS(∆×n ) the full subcategory of
Fun(N∆op , CSS(∆×n−1 ) spanned by the n-fold complete Segal spaces.
In order to make sense of the inductive definition above, it is necessary to show
that CSS(∆×n ) is a presentable quasicategory, and to construct a fully faithful,
colimit-preserving functor cn : CSS(∆0 ) ֒→ CSS(∆×n ). To prove presentability, we
demonstrate that the quasicategory CSS(∆×n ) is in fact an accessible localization
of Fun(N∆op , CSS(∆×n−1 )); then the desired functor cn will be the composite
cn−1

c

L

CSS(∆0 ) ֒→ CSS(∆×n−1 ) −→ Fun(∆op , CSS(∆×n−1 )) −→ CSS(∆×n ),
where c denotes the constant functor and L denotes the purported localization.
Lemma 12.2. For any positive integer n, the quasicategory CSS(∆×n ) is an accessible localization of Fun(N∆op , CSS(∆×n−1 )).
Proof. Denote by j any Yoneda embedding (the context will always be made clear).
Let K denote the simplicial set as in 10.3, which we regard as a simplicial space
that is discrete in each degree. This is a pushout along an inclusion, hence this is
also a (homotopy) pushout in the quasicategory of simplicial spaces. Now let T be
the strongly saturated class of morphisms of Fun(N∆op , CSS(∆×n−1 )) generated by
the three sets
{j([0], m) → j(0) | m ∈ ∆×n−1 },
{Segal∆ ⊠ m | m ∈ ∆×n−1 },
{cn−1 (K) → j(0)},
One deduces immediately that a simplicial object of CSS(∆×n−1 ) is a Segal space
if and only if it is local with respect to each of the first two sets of morphisms. To
show that CSS(∆×n ) coincides with the localization T −1 Fun(N∆op , CSS(∆×n−1 )),
it is enough to show that a 1-fold Segal space X is complete if and only if the
natural map
X0 → Map(K, X)
is an equivalence. By the Yoneda lemma, our claim is just a restatement of [38,
Pr. 10.1].
Corollary 12.3. For any nonnegative integer n, the quasicategory CSS(∆×n ) is an
accessible localization of P(∆×n−1 ).
Proof. If n = 0, there is nothing to prove. If n is positive, then let us suppose

the essentially unique functor that carries pairs of the form (j[k], j(m)) to j([k], m)
and preserves colimits separately in each variable. Now let T∆×n be the strongly
saturated class generated by the class T above along with the set
{j[k] ⊠ U → j[k] ⊠ V | [U → V ] ∈ T∆×n−1 }.

Remark 12.4. The class T∆×n is precisely the strongly saturated class generated by
the union of Segal∆×n , Glob∆×n , and Comp∆×n as in Cor 10.4.
Write d : ∆×n → Υn for the composite of the functor δn : ∆×n → Θn described in
[8, Df. 3.8] followed by the fully faithful functor i : Θn ֒→ Υn consider in the previous
section. We will now show that the triple (∆×n , T∆×n , d) satisfies conditions (R.1-4)
of Th. 9.2, hence CSS(∆×n ) is a homotopy theory of (∞, n)-categories. In contrast
to the previous section, the functor d is not fully-faithful and hence condition (R.3)
is not automatic. We thus begin with this condition.
Lemma 12.5. The triple (∆×n , T∆×n , d) satisfies condition (R.3), that is for all
objects m ∈ ∆×n , the canonical map m → δn∗ δn (m) ≃ d∗ d(m) is in T∆×n .
Proof. We will proceed by induction on n, the base case n = 0 being trivial. As the
functor j[m]⊠(−) preserves colimits and sends the generators of T∆×n−1 into T∆×n ,
we have a containment j[m] ⊠ T∆×n−1 ⊆ T∆×n . Thus by induction the canonical
map,
∗
j[m] ⊠ m → j[m] ⊠ δn−1
δn−1 (m)
is in T∆×n . In particular when m = 0, the map j[m] ⊠ m → j[m] ⊠ 0 is a composite
of maps in Glob∆×n , whence the map
∗
j[0] ⊠ δn−1
δn−1 (m) → j[0] ⊠ 0

is in T∆×n .
We will first prove the lemma for objects of the form j[1] ⊠ m ∈ ∆ × ∆×n−1 ∼
=
×n
∆ . One may readily check that the following is a pushout square of presheaves
of sets:
∗
∗
(j{0} ⊠ δn−1
δn−1 (m)) ⊔ (j{1} ⊠ δn−1
δn−1 (m))

∗
j[1] ⊠ δn−1
δn−1 (m)

(j{0} ⊠ 0) ⊔ (j{1} ⊠ 0)

δn∗ δn (j[1] ⊠ m)

Moreover, as the topmost map is an inclusion of sets and pushouts in P(∆×n ) are
computed object-wise, this is also a (homotopy) pushout square in P(∆×n ). As
we just observed, the left-most map is in the strongly saturated T∆×n , whence the
right-most map is also in T∆×n . It follows that the composite,
∗
j[1] ⊠ m → j[1] ⊠ δn−1
δn−1 (m) → δn∗ δn (j[1] ⊠ m)

is in T∆×n .
To prove the general case, i.e. that the map j[k] ⊠ m → δn∗ δn (j[k] ⊠ m) is in
T∆×n , we induct on k. Assume the result holds when k ≤ m. We will prove it for
k = m + 1. First consider the following commutative square:

40

CLARK BARWICK AND CHRISTOPHER SCHOMMER-PRIES

j[m] ⊠ m ∪j[0]⊠m j[1] ⊠ m

j[m + 1] ⊠ m

≀
δn∗ δn (j[m] ⊠ m) ∪j[0]⊠0 δn∗ δn (j[1] ⊠ m)

δn∗ δn (j[m + 1] ⊠ m)

The indicated maps are in T∆×n ; the topmost map is a generator and the lefttmost
vertical map by induction. As T∆×n is saturated, the rightmost vertical map is in
T∆×n if and only if the bottommost map is as well. Thus it suffices to prove that
the natural map
δn∗ δn (j[m] ⊠ m) ∪j[0]⊠0 δn∗ δn (j[1] ⊠ m) → δn∗ δn (j[m + 1] ⊠ m)
is in T∆×n .
The Yoneda embedding strongly generates any presheaf quasicategory and hence
the object δn∗ δn (j[m + 1] ⊠ m) may canonically be written as a colimit of representable presheaves. Let D = (∆×n ↓ δn∗ δn (j[m + 1] ⊠ m)) denote the overcategory
consisting of pairs (j[p] ⊠ p, φ) where φ is a map
φ : j[p] ⊠ p → δn∗ δn (j[m + 1] ⊠ m).
Let B : D → P(∆×n ) denote the functor which forgets the map φ. We have a
canonical equivalence in P(∆×n ):
colim B ≃ δn∗ δn (j[m + 1] ⊠ m).
D

By adjunction, specifying a map φ : j[p] ⊠ p → δn∗ δn (j[m + 1] ⊠ m) is equivalent
to a specifying a map φ′ : δn (j[p] ⊠ p) → δn (j[m + 1] ⊠ m), i.e. a map in P(Θn ):
φ′ : ([p]; δn−1 (p), . . . , δn−1 (p)) → ([m + 1]; δn−1 (m), . . . , δn−1 (m)).
p times

m+1 times

In particular every such map includes the data of a map φ : [p] → [m + 1]. To
simplify notation we will denote the object (j[p] ⊠ p, φ) as Bφ or simply φ.
Let C denote the full subcategory of D consisting of the union of the following
three types of objects:
(a) those Bφ in which φ factors as
φ : [p] → {0, . . . , m} ⊆ [m + 1],
(b) those Bφ in which φ factors as
φ : [p] → {m, m + 1} ⊆ [m + 1],
−1

and

(c) those Bφ in which (φ) ({m}) = {r} ⊆ [p] consists of a singleton for some
0 ≤ r ≤ p.
For any object D ∈ D, the under category CD/ actually has an initial object and
is thus weakly contractible. Consequently (see, e.g., [32, Th. 4.1.3.1 and Pr. 4.1.1.8]),
the induced morphism of (homotopy) colimits over these categories is an equivalence; in particular, it follows that the following canonical maps are equivalences in
P(∆×n ):
colim B ≃ colim B ≃ δn∗ δn (j[m + 1] ⊠ m).
C

D

ON THE UNICITY OF THE HOMOTOPY THEORY OF HIGHER CATEGORIES

For each φ ∈ C, let Aφ denote the fiber product
Aφ := Bφ ×δn∗ δn (j[m+1]⊠m) δn∗ δn (j[m] ⊠ m) ∪j[0]⊠0 δn∗ δn (j[1] ⊠ m) .
This gives rise to a new functor A : C → P(∆×n ), and as colimits in P(∆×n ) are
universal, we have natural equivalences:
colim A ≃
C

colim B
C

×δn∗ δn (j[m+1]⊠m) δn∗ δn (j[m] ⊠ m) ∪j[0]⊠0 δn∗ δn (j[1] ⊠ m)

≃ δn∗ δn (j[m] ⊠ m) ∪j[0]⊠0 δn∗ δn (j[1] ⊠ m).
Thus the desired result follows if we can demonstrate that the natural map
colim A → colim B
C

C

is in the class T∆×n . This class, being saturated, is closed under colimits, and so it
suffices to show that each of the maps
Aφ → Bφ
is in T∆×n . If Bφ ∈ C is of type (a) or type (b), then Aφ ≃ Bφ is an equivalence,
hence in the desired class. If Bφ = (j[p] ⊠ p, φ) is of type (c), so that (φ)−1 ({m}) =
{r} for 0 ≤ r ≤ p, then a direct calculation reveals:
Aφ ≃ (j{0, . . . , r} ⊠ p) ∪(j{r}⊠p) (j{r, r + 1, . . . , p} ⊠ p) → j[p] ⊠ p ≃ Bφ .
As this is one of the generators of T∆×n , the result follows.
Theorem 12.6. The quasicategory CSS(∆×n ) of n-fold complete Segal spaces is a
homotopy theory of (∞, n)-categories.
Proof. We will show that the triple (∆×n , T∆×n , d) satisfies conditions (R.1-4) of
Th. 9.2. Condition (R.4) clearly holds. Condition (R.3) is the statement of Lm. 12.5.
For condition (R.2) we must show that i! (δn )! (T∆×n ) ⊆ S. By Lm. 11.14 it is
sufficient to show that (δn )! (T∆×n ) ⊆ TΘn , and as (δn )! preserves colimits it is
sufficient to check this on the generating classes Segal∆×n , Glob∆×n , and Comp∆×n .
In each case this is clear: the set Glob∆×n maps under (δn )! to equivalences in
P(Θn ), the set Comp∆Θn is constructed as the image of Comp∆×n under (δn )! , and
the image of Segal∆×n under (δn )! is a subset of Segal∆Θn .
For the final condition (R.1) we must show that δn∗ i∗ (S) ⊆ T∆×n . By Th. 11.13,
it suffices to show that δn∗ (TΘn ) ⊆ T∆×n . As δn∗ preserves colimits, it is sufficient
to prove this for the generating class of TΘn . As we previously mentioned, the
set Comp∆Θn consists of elements in the image of (δn )! . By Pr. 10.5 the remaining
generators of TΘn are retracts of maps in the image of (δn )! . Thus TΘn is contained in
the strongly saturated class generated from (δn )! (T∆×n ). Hence δn∗ (TΘn ) is contained
in the strongly saturated class generated by δn∗ (δn )! (T∆×n ). Using Lm. 12.5 one
readily deduces that the generators of T∆×n are mapped, via δn∗ (δn )! back into
T∆×n . As the composite functor δn∗ (δn )! preserves colimits, this implies that the
saturated class generated by δn∗ (δn )! (T∆×n ) is contained in T∆×n , whence δn∗ (TΘn ) ⊆
T∆×n .
Corollary 12.7. The functor CSS(Θn ) → CSS(∆×n ) induced by δn is an equivalence of quasicategories.

13. Epilogue: Model categories of (∞, n)-categories
We conclude with a brief discussion of model categories of (∞, n)-categories, in
which we describe some interactions between our results here and those of Bergner,
Lurie, Rezk, and Simpson. We first note that a spate of further corollaries to our
main results can be obtained by employing the following.
Construction 13.1. Suppose A a category equipped with a subcategory wA that
contains all the objects of A (i.e., a relative category in the terminology of [5]).
We call the morphisms of wA weak equivalences. In this situation, one may form
the hammock localization LH A of Dwyer–Kan [18]; this is a simplicial category. One
may apply to each mapping space a fibrant replacement R that preserves products
(e.g., Ex∞ ) to obtain a category enriched in Kan complexes, which we shall denote
LHf A. We may now apply the simplicial nerve construction [32, 1.1.5.5] to obtain a
quasicategory NLHf A, which we shall denote simply by NH A. We shall call NH A the
quasicategory underlying the relative category A.
When A is a simplicial model category, the simplicial localization LH A is equivalent [19] to the full sub-simplicial category A◦ spanned by the cofirant-fibrant
objects. In this case, our NH A is equivalent to NA◦ , as used by Lurie [32, A.2].
Remark 13.2. When A and B are model categories, and F : A ⇄ B : G is a Quillen
equivalence between them, there is [19] an induced equivalence of hammock localizations LH A ≃ LH B, and thus of underlying quasicategories NH A ≃ NH B.
Example 13.3. The quasicategory underlying the relative category of n-relative
categories [4] is a homotopy theory of (∞, n)-categories.
Definition 13.4. Let us call a model category A a model category of (∞, n)categories if its underlying quasicategory NH A is a homotopy theory of (∞, n)categories.
Example 13.5. By [30], the Joyal model category of simplicial sets is a model category of (∞, 1)-categories. More generally, all of the model categories listed in Fig. 1
are model categories of (∞, 1)-categories.
Example 13.6. By Th. 11.15 and Th. 12.6, both Rezk’s model category Θn Sp of
complete Θn -spaces [38] and the model category of n-fold complete Segal spaces
[2, 33] are model categories of (∞, n)-categories.
We may now use the construction above to find more examples of theories of (∞, n)categories.
Example 13.7 ([33, Pr. 1.5.4]). Let M be a left proper simplicial combinatorial
model category which is an absolute distributor ([33, Df. 1.5.1]). Then the category
Fun(∆op , M), of simplicial objects in M, admits the M-enriched complete Segal
model structure CSSM , which is again left proper, simplicial, combinatorial, and
an absolute distributor. If M is a model category of of (∞, n − 1)-categories, then
CSSM is a model category of (∞, n)-categories.
The condition of being an absolute distributor is needed in order to formulate the
correct notion of complete M-enriched Segal object. We refer the reader to [33] for
details, but note that being an absolute distributor is a property of the underlying
quasicategory of the given model category. In particular it is preserved under any
Quillen equivalence.

ON THE UNICITY OF THE HOMOTOPY THEORY OF HIGHER CATEGORIES

43

Example 13.8. Suppose that M is a model category satisfying the following list of
conditions.
(M.1) The class of weak equivalences of M are closed under filtered colimits.
(M.2) Every monomorphism of M is a cofibration.
(M.3) For any object Y of M, the functor X → X × Y preserves colimits.
(M.4) For any cofibrations f : X → Y and f ′ : X ′ → Y ′ , the pushout product
′

f f ′ : (X × Y ′ ) ∪(X×X ) (Y × X ′ ) → Y × Y ′
is a cofibration that is trivial if either f or f ′ is.
(M.5) The quasicategory NH M is a homotopy theory of (∞, n − 1)-categories.
Work of Bergner [11] and Lurie [33], combined with 12.6 above, shows that each of
the following is an example of a model category of (∞, n)-categories:
• the projective or (equivalently) the injective model category [33, 2.2.16,
2.3.1, 2.3.9] SegM of M-enriched preSegal categories, and
• the model category [32, A.3.2] CatM of categories enriched in M.
Moreover, following Simpson [41] the injective (aka Reedy) model category of Segal
(n − 1)-categories [26, 36, 41] satisfies conditions (M.1-4); indeed, the most difficult
of these to verify is (M.4), which Simpson does in [41, Th. 19.3.2 (using Cor. 17.2.6)].
Thus, for example, the injective and projective model categories of Θn Sp-enriched
Segal categories SegΘn Sp as well as the model category CatΘn Sp of categories enriched in Θn Sp are seen to be model categories of (∞, n)-categories. Indeed very
recent work of Bergner and Rezk [12] discusses these model categories in detail and
links them by an explicit chain of Quillen equivalences.
Additionally, we see that the injective model category of Segal n-categories is
also a model category of (∞, n)-categories, as is the model category of categories
enriched in Segal (n − 1)-categories.
A partial converse to 13.2 holds, which allows one to deduce Quillen equivalences
between these various model categories.
Lemma 13.9 ([32, A.3.7.7]). Two combinatorial model categories A and B are
connected by a chain of Quillen equivalences if and only if NH A and NH B are
equivalent quasicategories.
From this it follows that if A and B are combinatorial model categories with
the property that both NH A and NH B are homotopy theories of (∞, n)-categories,
then A and B are connected by a chain of Quillen equivalences. This applies to all
of the model categories of (∞, n)-categories mentioned above.
A zig-zag of Quillen equivalences can be a troublesome gadget to work with. It is
usually far more informative to have a single direct and explicit Quillen equivalence
between competing model categories of (∞, n)-categories. While our techniques do
not generally provide such a direct Quillen equivalence, we do offer the following
recognition principle.
Proposition 13.10. Let A and B be two model categories of (∞, n)-categories and
let L : A ⇆ B : R be a Quillen adjunction between them. Then (L, R) is a Quillen
equivalence if and only if the left derived functor NH L : NH A → NH B preserves the
cells up to weak equivalence.
Proof. A Quillen equivalence induces an equivalence NH L : NH A → NH B of quasicategories. By Cor. 8.5 and Lm. 4.5 any such equivalence necessarily preserves the

44

CLARK BARWICK AND CHRISTOPHER SCHOMMER-PRIES

cells up to equivalence. Conversely, as the left-derived functor NH L : NH A → NH B
preserves (homotopy) colimits and NH A and NH B are generated under (homotopy)
colimits by the cells (Cor. 8.4), it follows that NH L induces an equivalence of quasicategories. In particular it induces an equivalence of homotopy categories, and
hence (L, R) is a Quillen equivalence.
In particular the above applies when the cells are fibrant-cofibrant objects of A
and B which are preserved by L itself.
Example 13.11. The standard Quillen adjunction (cf. [33, Lm. 2.3.13]) from Segal
n-categories to n-fold complete Segal spaces is a Quillen equivalence.
Example 13.12. The functor δn induces a Quillen equivalence between the model
category of complete Segal Θn -spaces [38] and the model category of n-fold complete
Segal spaces [33, 1.5.4]. (See also Bergner–Rezk [13]).
A category with a specified subcategory of weak equivalences is a relative category, and hence gives rise to a homotopy theory. Thus any theory of (∞, n)categories arising this way may, in principle, be compared using our axioms. We
therefore end with the following.
Conjecture 13.13. The quasicategory underlying Verity’s n-trivial weak complicial
sets [43, 44] is a homotopy theory of (∞, n)-categories. The relative category consisting of Batanin’s ω-categories [6] such that every k-cell is an equivalence for
k > n, together with the class of morphisms which are essentially k-surjective for
all k is a homotopy theory of (∞, n)-categories.
