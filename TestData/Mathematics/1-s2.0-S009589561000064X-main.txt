In this paper we prove that if G is a connected claw-free graph
with three pairwise non-adjacent vertices, with chromatic number
χ and clique number ω, then χ
2ω and the same for the
complement of G. We also prove that the choice number of G is at
most 2ω, except possibly in the case when G can be obtained from
a subgraph of the Schläﬂi graph by replicating vertices. Finally, we
show that the constant 2 is best possible in all cases.

1. Introduction
All graphs in this paper are ﬁnite and simple. Let G be a graph. For a subset X of V (G ) we denote
by G | X the subgraph of G induced on X . We say that X ⊆ V (G ) is a claw if G | X is isomorphic
to the complete bipartite graph K 1,3 , and G is claw-free if no subset of V (G ) is a claw. Line graphs
are a well-known class of claw-free graphs, but there are others, such as circular interval graphs and
subgraphs of the Schläﬂi graph (a circular interval graph is obtained from a collection of points and
intervals of a circle by making two points adjacent if they belong to the same interval). In [3] we
prove a theorem that explicitly describes the structure of all claw-free graphs.
Claw-free graphs being a generalization of line graphs, it is natural to ask what properties of line
graphs can be extended to all claw-free graphs. A clique in a graph is a set of vertices all pairwise
adjacent. A stable set is a set of vertices all pairwise non-adjacent. A triangle is a clique of size three,
and a triad is a stable set of size three. For a graph G, we denote by ω(G ) the size of the largest clique
in G, and by χ (G ) the chromatic number of G. Vizing’s theorem [6] gives a bound on χ (G ) in terms
of ω(G ) if G is the line graph of a simple graph, namely χ ω + 1. But what about other claw-free
f (ω(G ))? It is
graphs? Does there exist a function f such that if G is a claw-free graph then χ (G )

easy to see that such f exists, and in fact χ (G ) ω(G )2 (the neighbourhood of a vertex in a clique
of size ω(G ) is the union of at most ω(G ) cliques).
One might hope to get closer to Vizing’s bound, asking whether f is a linear function. Unfortunately the answer to this question is negative (in fact, the power two is best possible). If G is a
| V (G )|
, and yet ω(G ) may be of order | V (G )| log | V (G )| [5]. However,
triad-free graph, then χ (G )
2
if we insist that G contains a triad, and is connected (to prevent counterexamples obtained by taking
disjoint unions with large triad-free graphs), then a much stronger result is true. The main result of
this paper is the following:
1.1. Let G be a connected, claw-free graph that contains a triad. Then χ (G )

2ω(G ).

This bound is best possible, in the sense that the constant 2 cannot be replaced by any smaller
constant (in Section 4, we construct an inﬁnite family of claw-free graphs, satisfying the hypotheses
of 1.1, with the ratio of the chromatic number and the clique number arbitrarily close to 2).
Let us say that a graph G is tame if there exists a connected claw-free graph H with a triad, such
that G is an induced subgraph of H . We prove a slight strengthening of 1.1, the following:
1.2. Let G be tame. Then χ (G )

2ω(G ).

As we will show in Section 4, the bound of 1.2 is best possible (not only asymptotically). The proof
of 1.2 uses the structure theorem mentioned above.
There is a slightly worse, but still linear bound on χ in terms of ω , that has a short proof, without
using the structure theorem, and we include it here. We prove:
1.3. Let G be tame. Then χ (G )

4ω(G ).

In fact, we prove the following stronger statement that clearly implies 1.3.
1.4. Let G be tame. Then every vertex of G has degree at most 4ω(G ) − 1.
For v ∈ V (G ) we denote by N G ( v ) (or N ( v ) when there is no ambiguity) the set of neighbours
of v in G. Let X ⊆ V (G ). We denote by G \ X the graph G | ( V (G ) \ X ). For v ∈ V (G ) we denote by
G \ v the graph G \ { v }. We start with two lemmas:
1.5. Let G be a claw-free graph, let X , Y be disjoint subsets of V (G ) with X = ∅, and assume that for every
two non-adjacent vertices of Y , every vertex of X is adjacent to exactly one of them. Then Y is the union of two
cliques.
Proof. Since for every two non-adjacent vertices a, b ∈ Y , N (a) ∩ X and N (b) ∩ X partition X , it follows
that G | Y contains no complement of an odd cycle, so G | Y is the complement of a bipartite graph;
and in particular Y is the union of two cliques. ✷
1.6. Let G be a claw-free graph that contains a triad, and assume that there is a vertex v ∈ V (G ), with a neighbour in G, and such that G \ v contains no triad. Then V (G ) is the union of four cliques, and in particular
ω(G ) | V (4G )| .
Proof. Let X be the set of neighbours of v in G, and let Y = V (G ) \ ( X ∪ { v }). Since G contains
a triad, and G \ v does not, it follows that there exist two non-adjacent vertices y 1 , y 2 in Y . Since
v has a neighbour in G, it follows that X is non-empty. For i = 1, 2 let N y i be the set of neighbours
of y i in X . Since {x, y 1 , y 2 , v } is a claw in G for every x ∈ N y 1 ∩ N y 2 , it follows that N y 1 ∩ N y 2 = ∅.
Since G \ v contains no triad, X \ N y i is a clique for i = 1, 2, and therefore X ∪ { v } is the union of two
cliques. Also since G \ v contains no triad, N y 1 ∪ N y 2 = X . So for every two non-adjacent vertices in

562

Y every vertex of X is adjacent to exactly one of them. By 1.5 it follows that Y is the union of two
| V (G )|
, and the theorem
cliques. But now V (G ) is the union of four cliques, and in particular ω(G )
4
holds. ✷
1.6 has the following useful corollary:
1.7. Let G be tame. Then either G contains a triad, or V (G ) is the union of four cliques.
Proof. Suppose that G contains no triad. Let H be a connected claw-free graph with a triad such that
G is an induced subgraph of H . Since H is connected, we can number the vertices of V ( H ) \ V (G ) as
{ v 1 , . . . , v k } such that for 1 i k, v i has a neighbour in V (G ) ∪ { v 1 , . . . , v i −1 }. Choose i minimum
such that V (G ) ∪ { v 1 , . . . , v i } includes a triad, and let G be the subgraph of H induced on V (G ) ∪
{ v 1 , . . . , v i }. Since G \ v i has no triad, 1.6 implies that V (G ) (and hence V (G )) is the union of four
cliques. This proves 1.7. ✷
Proof of 1.4. Let v be a vertex of maximum degree in G and let N be the set of neighbours of v. Since
G is claw-free, G | ( N ∪ { v }) contains no triad. Now the result follows from 1.7. This proves 1.4. ✷
We also prove a variant of 1.1 with chromatic number replaced by choice number. Let G be a graph,
and for every v ∈ V (G ), let L v be a list of colours. We say that G is colourable from the lists { L v } v ∈ V (G )
if there exists a proper colouring of G such that every vertex v is coloured with a colour from L v .
The choice number of G is the smallest integer k such that for every set of lists { L v }, if | L v | k for
every v ∈ V (G ), then G is colourable from the lists { L v }. We denote the choice number of G by
ch(G ). Clearly, χ (G ) ch(G ). In Section 5 we prove that if G tame and G does not belong to a special
restricted class of claw-free graphs (that we will deﬁne later), then ch(G ) 2ω(G ).
Let G denote the complement of the graph G (that is, the graph on the same vertex set as G, such
that two vertices are adjacent in G if and only if they are non-adjacent in G). It turns out that one
can also bound the chromatic number of a graph whose complement is claw-free in terms of the size
of its maximum clique. We prove:
1.8. Let G be tame. Then χ (G )

2ω(G ).

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we develop some tools that will
be used in the proof of 1.2. In Section 3 we state the structure theorem from [3], and deduce from it
that every connected claw-free graph with a triad either can be handled by the methods developed
in Section 2, or is obtained by replicating vertices from an induced subgraph of the Schläﬂi graph (we
will deﬁne the Schläﬂi graph and make this precise later). In Section 4 we prove that the conclusion
of 1.2 holds for the latter class of claw-free graphs, and thus complete the proof of 1.2. We also
show that the constant in 1.1 is best possible, and that the bound of 1.2 is best possible, not only
asymptotically. In Section 5 we prove the bound on ch(G ). Finally, in Section 6 we prove 1.8.
2. Tools
We start with some deﬁnitions. Let G be a graph. A non-empty subset X of V (G ) is said to be
connected if the graph G | X is connected. A component of G is a maximal connected subgraph of G.
For a vertex v and a set A ⊆ V (G ) not containing v, we say that v is complete (anticomplete) to A
if v is adjacent to every (no) vertex of A, respectively. Two disjoint sets A , B ⊆ V (G ) are complete
(anticomplete) to each other if every vertex of A is complete (anticomplete) to B.
Let G be a connected claw-free graph with a triad. It turns out that in many cases we can prove
that G has one of the following properties: either the set of neighbours of some vertex v of G is the
| V (G )|
union of two cliques (in this case we say that v is bisimplicial), or ω(G )
. In 2.1 and 2.2 we
4
show that both these properties are useful in proving that the conclusion of 1.2 holds for G.

But t = | X | + n − 2k | X | + 2 2, a contradiction. This proves the ﬁrst assertion of (2). The second
assertion follows from the ﬁrst by 1.7. This proves (2).

2ω(G ),

Proof. First we prove the ﬁrst statement of 2.2. Let c be a colouring of G \ v with at most 2ω(G )
colours. Since v is bisimplicial, at most 2(ω(G ) − 1) colours appear in N ( v ), and so there is a colour
that does not appear in N ( v ). Therefore, the colouring of G \ v can be extended to a colouring of G,
and χ (G ) 2ω(G ). This proves the ﬁrst assertion of 2.2.
Let us now prove the second assertion. Let { L u }u ∈ V (G ) be a set of lists such that | L u | 2ω(G )
for every u ∈ V (G ). Then G \ v can be coloured from these lists. Since v is bisimplicial, at most
2(ω(G ) − 1) colours appear in N ( v ), and so there is a colour in L v that does not appear in N ( v ).
Therefore, the colouring of G \ v can be extended to a colouring of G, and ch(G )
2ω(G ). This
completes the proof of 2.2. ✷
3. The structure of claw-free graphs
The goal of this section is to state and prove a structural lemma about claw-free graphs that we
will later use to prove our main result. The proof of the lemma relies on (an immediate corollary of)
the main result of [3], and we start with deﬁnitions necessary to state it.
Let G be a graph, and let F be a set of unordered pairs of distinct vertices of G such that every
vertex belongs to at most one member of F . Then H is a thickening of (G , F ) if for every v ∈ V (G )

564

there is a non-empty subset X v ⊆ V ( H ), all pairwise disjoint and with union V ( H ) satisfying the
following:

•
•
•
•

for each v ∈ V (G ), X v is a clique of H ,
if u , v ∈ V (G ) are adjacent in G and {u , v } ∈
/ F , then X u is complete to X v in H ,
if u , v ∈ V (G ) are non-adjacent in G and {u , v } ∈
/ F , then X u is anticomplete to X v in H ,
if {u , v } ∈ F then X u is neither complete nor anticomplete to X v in H .

First we list some classes of claw-free graphs that are needed for the statement of the structure
theorem from [3].

• Graphs from the icosahedron. The icosahedron is the unique planar graph with twelve vertices
10, v i is adjacent to
all of degree ﬁve. Let it have vertices v 0 , v 1 , . . . , v 11 , where for 1 i
v i +1 , v i +2 (reading subscripts modulo 10), and v 0 is adjacent to v 1 , v 3 , v 5 , v 7 , v 9 , and v 11 is
adjacent to v 2 , v 4 , v 6 , v 8 , v 10 . Let this graph be G 0 . Let G 1 be obtained from G 0 by deleting v 11
and let G 2 be obtained from G 1 by deleting v 10 . Furthermore, let F = {{ v 1 , v 4 }, { v 6 , v 9 }}.
Let G ∈ T1 if G is a thickening of (G 0 , ∅), (G 1 , ∅), or (G 2 , F ) for some F ⊆ F .
• Fuzzy long circular interval graphs. Let Σ be a circle, and let F 1 , . . . , F k ⊆ Σ be homeomorphic
to the interval [0, 1], such that no two of F 1 , . . . , F k share an endpoint, and no three of them
have union Σ . Now let V ⊆ Σ be ﬁnite, and let H be a graph with vertex set V in which distinct
u , v ∈ V are adjacent precisely if u , v ∈ F i for some i.
Let F be the set of pairs {u , v } such that u , v ∈ V are distinct endpoints of F i for some i. Let
F ⊆ F . Then G is a fuzzy long circular interval graph if for some such H and F , G is a thickening
of ( H , F ).
Let G ∈ T2 if G is a fuzzy long circular interval graph.
• Fuzzy antiprismatic graphs. A graph H is called antiprismatic if for every triad T and every vertex
v ∈ V ( H )\ T , v has exactly two neighbours in T . Let u , v be two vertices of an antiprismatic graph
H . We say that the pair {u , v } is changeable if u is non-adjacent to v, and the graph obtained from
G by adding the edge uv is also antiprismatic. Let H be an antiprismatic graph and let F be a set
of changeable pairs of H such that every vertex of H belongs to at most one member of H . We
say that a graph G is a fuzzy antiprismatic graph if G is a thickening of ( H , F ).
Let G ∈ T3 if G is a fuzzy antiprismatic graph.
Next, we deﬁne what it means for a claw-free graph to admit a “strip-structure”. A hypergraph H consists of a ﬁnite set V ( H ), a ﬁnite set E ( H ), and an incidence relation between V ( H ) and E ( H ) (that
is, a subset of V ( H ) × E ( H )). For the statement of the structure theorem, we only need hypergraphs
such that every member of E ( H ) is incident with either one or two members of V ( H ) (thus, these
hypergraphs are graphs if we allow “graphs” to have loops and parallel edges). For F ∈ E ( H ), let us
denote by F the set of elements of V ( H ) incident with F .
Let G be a graph. A strip-structure ( H , η) of G consists of a hypergraph H with E ( H ) = ∅, and
a function η mapping each F ∈ E ( H ) to a subset η( F ) of V (G ), and mapping each pair ( F , h) with
F ∈ E ( H ) and h ∈ F to a subset η( F , h) of η( F ), satisfying the following conditions.

• (S1) The sets η( F ) (F ∈ E ( H )) are non-empty and pairwise disjoint and have union V (G ).
• (S2) For each h ∈ V ( H ), the union of the sets η( F , h) for all F ∈ E ( H ) with h ∈ F is a clique of G.
• (S3) For all distinct F 1 , F 2 ∈ E ( H ), if v 1 ∈ η( F 1 ) and v 2 ∈ η( F 2 ) are adjacent in G, then there
exists h ∈ F 1 ∩ F 2 such that v 1 ∈ η( F 1 , h) and v 2 ∈ η( F 2 , h).
• (S4) For every F ∈ E ( H ), h ∈ F and v ∈ η( F , h) the set of neighbours of v in η( F ) \ η( F , h) is
a clique.

• (S5) Let F ∈ E ( H ) with | F | = 2, say F = {h1 , h2 }. If η( F , h1 ) ∩ η( F , h2 ) = ∅, then η( F , h1 ) ∩
η ( F , h 2 ) = η ( F ).
We say that a strip-structure is non-trivial if | E ( H )| 2.
The following is a corollary of the main theorem of [3].

3.1. Let G be a connected claw-free graph. Then either

• V (G ) is the union of three cliques, or
• G admits a non-trivial strip-structure, or
• G ∈ T1 ∪ T2 ∪ T3 .
We also need a few deﬁnitions from [2]. ([2] deals with a class of graphs whose complements are
claw-free, so for our purposes in this paper, we need to reformulate the deﬁnitions and results of [2]
in terms of claw-free graphs.)
Let G be an antiprismatic graph. The core of G is the union of all triads of G. Let W be the core
of G. For v ∈ V (G ) \ W , replicating v means replacing v by several vertices, all pairwise adjacent, and
otherwise with the same neighbours as v. Please note that the graph produced in this manner is still
antiprismatic.
3.
Let G have 27 vertices {r ij , sij , t ij : 1 i , j 3}, with adjacency as follows. Let 1 i , i , j , j

• If i = i or j = j then r ij is adjacent to r ij , and sij is adjacent to sij , and t ij is adjacent to t ij ; while
if i = i and j = j then the same three pairs are non-adjacent.
• If j = i then r ij is adjacent to sij , and sij is adjacent to t ij , and t ij is adjacent to r ij ; while if j = i
then the same three pairs are non-adjacent.
This is the Schläﬂi graph. All induced subgraphs of G are antiprismatic, and we call any such graph
Schläﬂi-antiprismatic.
We need the following theorem from [2]:
3.2. Let G be antiprismatic, with at least one triad. Then one of the following holds:

• there is a Schläﬂi-antiprismatic graph G 0 with no changeable pairs, such that G can be obtained from G 0
by replicating vertices not in the core, or
k 3, there is a list of 4k cliques of G such that every vertex belongs to exactly k of
them.

• for some k with 1

We can now state the main result of this section.
3.3. Let G be an induced subgraph of a connected claw-free graph H such that H contains a triad. Then either

• there exists a Schläﬂi-antiprismatic graph H 0 such that G is a thickening of ( H 0 , ∅), or
• G has at least two bisimplicial vertices, or
• ω(G ) | V (4G )| .
Proof. By 3.1, either

• V (G ) is the union of three cliques, or
• G admits a non-trivial strip-structure, or
• G ∈ T1 ∪ T2 ∪ T3 .
| V (G )|

| V (G )|

If V (G ) is the union of three cliques, then ω(G )
and the theorem holds, so we
3
4
may assume that one of the other outcomes holds.
Assume that G admits a non-trivial strip-structure, and let H and η be as in the deﬁnition of
a strip-structure. For h ∈ V ( H ) we denote by η(h) the set F : h∈ F η( F , h).
(1) For every F ∈ E ( H ) and h ∈ F , every vertex of η( F , h) is bisimplicial in G.

566

Let F ∈ E ( H ), h ∈ F and v ∈ η( F , h). Suppose ﬁrst that F = {h, h } and η( F , h) ∩ η( F , h ) = ∅. By (S5),
η( F , h) = η( F , h ) = η( F ). Consequently, by (S3) N G ( v ) = η(h) ∪ η(h ). But by (S2) each of the sets
η(h) and η(h ) is a clique, and therefore v is a bisimplicial vertex of G and (1) holds. Thus we may
assume that either

• F = {h}, or
• F = {h, h } for some h ∈ V ( H ) \ {h}, and η( F , h) ∩ η( F , h ) = ∅.
In both cases, by (S3), N G ( v ) ⊆ η(h) ∪ η( F ). But, by (S2), η(h) is a clique, and by (S4) the set of
neighbours of v in η( F ) \ η(h) is a clique. Consequently, N G ( v ) is the union of two cliques, and so v
is a bisimplicial vertex of G. This proves (1).
By (1), and since | E ( H )| 2, it follows that G has at least two bisimplicial vertices, and 3.3 holds.
Thus we may assume that G ∈ T1 ∪ T2 ∪ T3 . Suppose G ∈ T1 . Let G 0 , G 1 , G 2 be as in the deﬁnition
of T1 . For 0 i 11, let X v i be as in the deﬁnition of a thickening, except if G is a thickening of G 1 ,
let X v 11 = ∅, and if G is a thickening of G 2 , let X v 10 = X v 11 = ∅. Let

C 1 = X v 1 ∪ X v 9 ∪ X v 10 ,
C2 = X v2 ∪ X v3 ∪ X v4
C 3 = X v 6 ∪ X v 8 ∪ X v 11 ,
C4 = X v0 ∪ X v5 ∪ X v7 .
| V (G )|

Then each of C 1 , C 2 , C 3 , C 4 is a clique, and V (G ) = C 1 ∪ C 2 ∪ C 3 ∪ C 4 , and therefore ω(G )
and
4
the theorem holds.
If G ∈ T2 , then every vertex of G is bisimplicial and again the theorem holds. Thus we may assume
that G ∈ T3 , and so there exists an antiprismatic graph H and a set F of changeable pairs of H such
that every vertex of H is in at most one member of F , and G is a thickening of ( H , F ). In particular,
if {u , v } ∈ F , then u is non-adjacent to v in H . If G contains no triad, then by 1.7, V (G ) is the
| V (G )|
union of four cliques, and therefore ω(G )
. Thus we may assume that G contains a triad,
4
and consequently so does H . For v ∈ V ( H ), let X v be as in the deﬁnition of a thickening. By 3.2,
either

• there is a Schläﬂi-antiprismatic graph H 0 with no changeable pairs, such that H can be obtained
from H 0 by replicating vertices not in the core, or
k 3, there is a list of 4k cliques of H such that every vertex belongs to
exactly k of them.

• for some k with 1

Suppose that there exists a Schläﬂi-antiprismatic graph H 0 with no changeable pairs, such that H
can be obtained from H 0 by replicating vertices not in the core. Since H 0 has no changeable edges,
it follows that neither does H , and so F = ∅. But now G is a thickening of ( H 0 , ∅), and the theorem
holds.
So we may assume that for some k with 1 k 3, C 1 , . . . , C 4k are cliques of H such that every
vertex of H belongs to exactly k of them. For i ∈ {1, . . . , 4k}, let C i = v ∈C i X v . Then, since every
vertex pair in F is a non-adjacent pair of H , it follows that each of the sets C i is a clique of G, and
every vertex of G is in exactly k of them. Thus
4k

C i = k V (G ) ,
i =1

and so for some i, |C i |

4. The proof of 1.2
The goal of this section is to prove 1.2. We start with a lemma.
4.1. Let H 0 be a Schläﬂi-antiprismatic graph, and let G be a thickening of ( H 0 , ∅). Then either ω(G )
or χ (G ) 2ω(G ).

Proof. The proof is by induction on | V (G )|. Let i , j ∈ {1, 2, 3} and let r ij , sij , t ij be as in the deﬁnition of
the Schläﬂi graph. Then V ( H 0 ) ⊆ {r ij , sij , t ij : 1

same for R ij and T ij . We may assume that ω(G ) < 4 , and therefore | V (G )| is not the union of
four cliques. For Y ⊆ V (G ), let the width of Y , denoted by width(Y ), be the number of vertices v
of H 0 such that Y ∩ X v is non-empty.
(1) Let K be a maximal clique of G. Then width( K ) > 3.
Suppose not. From the symmetry of the Schläﬂi graph [1], we may assume that K ⊆ S 11 ∪ S 12 ∪ S 13 .
Since K is a maximum clique in G, it follows that no vertex of G is complete to S 11 ∪ S 12 ∪ S 13 , and so

and let C 4 = j =1 T 1j . Then each of C 1 , C 2 , C 3 , C 4 is a clique, and V (G ) =
This proves (1).

(2) If either
1. no clique of G of size ω(G ) has width four, or
2. there exists V 1 ⊆ V ( H 0 ) such that
• | V ( H 0 )| − 1 | V 1 |,

• v ∈ V 1 X v includes every clique of size ω(G ) and width four in G, and
• χ ( H 0 | V 1 ) 8,
then 4.1 holds.
Suppose ﬁrst that there is no clique of size ω(G ) and width four in G. For every v ∈ V ( H 0 ), let
x v ∈ X v and let Y = {x v } v ∈ V ( H 0 ) and let G 1 = G \ Y . Then, by (1), every clique of size ω(G ) in G
has width at least ﬁve, and so every maximum clique of G meets Y in at least ﬁve vertices. Also
by (1), every maximal clique of G of size ω(G ) − 1 meets Y in at least four vertices. It follows that
ω(G 1 ) ω(G ) − 5. Inductively, χ (G 1 ) 2ω(G 1 ). Since the Schläﬂi graph is 9-colourable, it follows
that Y is the union of at most nine stable sets. But now

χ (G )

ω ( G ) − 5 + 9 < 2ω ( G )

and 4.1 holds.
Next suppose that there exists V 1 as in the second alternative hypothesis of (2). For every v ∈ V 1 ,
let x v ∈ X v and let Z = {x v } v ∈ V 1 . Let G 2 = G \ Z .
By (1), since | Z | | V ( H 0 )| − 1, and since every maximum clique of width four in G is contained
in
v ∈ V 1 X v , it follows that every maximum clique of G meets Z in at least four vertices. Also by
(1), every maximal clique of G of size ω(G ) − 1 meets Y in at least three vertices. Consequently,
ω(G 2 ) ω(G ) − 4. Inductively, χ (G 2 ) 2ω(G 2 ). Since χ ( H 0 | V 1 ) 8, it follows that Z is the union
of at most eight stable sets. But now

χ (G )

χ (G 2 ) + 8

2ω ( G 2 ) + 8

and 4.1 holds. This proves (2).

We observe that, since G is a thickening of ( H 0 , ∅), if for some v ∈ V ( H 0 ), X v meets a maximum
clique K of G, then X v ⊆ K . Let v 0 ∈ V ( H 0 ) be such that X v 0 is a subset of some clique of size ω(G )
and width four in G, and subject to that with | X v 0 | minimum (by (2), we may assume that there
exists a clique of size ω(G ) and width four in G). Let K 0 be a clique of size ω(G ) and width four in G

with X v 0 ⊆ K 0 . From the symmetry of the Schläﬂi graph [1], we may assume that K 0 = ( i =1 S 3i ) ∪ T 32

and v 0 = t 3 . By the maximality of K 0 , it follows that T 1 ∪ T 2 ∪ T 3 = ∅.
(3) If for some i ∈ {1, 2, 3}, either S 2i = ∅ or no clique of size ω(G ) and width four in G includes S 21 , then 4.1
holds.
From the symmetry, we may assume that either S 21 = ∅, or no clique of size ω(G ) and width four in
G includes S 21 . By an earlier remark, in both cases, K ∩ S 21 = ∅ for every clique K of size ω(G ) and
width four in G. Let V 1 = V ( H 0 ) \ {s12 }. Now

are eight stable sets in the Schläﬂi graph, and their union includes V 1 . Thus
follows from (2). This proves (3).

8, and 4.1

In view of (3), we may assume that for every i ∈ {1, 2, 3}, S 2i = ∅, and there exists a clique K i
of size ω(G ) and width four in G, such that S 2i ⊆ K i . By the choice of K 0 and v 0 , it follows that
| S 2i | | T 32 | for i ∈ {1, 2, 3}. Also, since K 0 is a clique of size ω(G ), and since ( K 0 \ T 32 ) ∪ T 11 ∪ T 21 is
a clique in G, it follow that | T 11 | + | T 21 | | T 32 | | S 2i | for i ∈ {1, 2, 3}. In particular,

We are now ready to prove 1.2.
Proof of 1.2. The proof is by induction on | V (G )|, and so we may assume that if G = G is a proper
induced subgraph of G, then χ (G ) 2ω(G ). By 3.3, either

• G has at least two bisimplicial vertices, or
• ω(G ) | V (4G )| .

, then 1.2 follows from 2.1, and thus we may assume that ω(G ) < 4 .
Suppose G contains a bisimplicial vertex v. Inductively it follows that χ (G \ v ) 2ω(G \ v ), and 1.2
follows from 2.2.
So we may assume that there exists a Schläﬂi-antiprismatic graph H 0 such that G is a thickening
| V (G )|
of ( H 0 , ∅). But now, since ω(G ) < 4 , 1.2 follows from 4.1. This proves 1.2. ✷
If

Clearly, 1.2 implies 1.1. We remark that 1.1 is tight, in the sense that the constant 2 cannot be
replaced with a smaller one. Let n be a positive integer, and let us deﬁne the graph G n as follows:

•
•
•
•
•
•

•

V (G n ) is the disjoint union of the sets {x, y , z, w }, A, B, C , D,
A = {a1 , . . . , an }, B = {b1 , . . . , bn }, C = {c 1 , . . . , cn } and D = {d1 , . . . , dn },
A , B , C , D are cliques,
x is complete to B ∪ C and anticomplete to A ∪ D, y is complete to B ∪ D and anticomplete
to A ∪ C , z is complete to A ∪ C and anticomplete to B ∪ D, and w is complete to A ∪ D and
anticomplete to B ∪ C ,
the pairs xy , xz, w y , w z are adjacent and the pairs xw , yz are non-adjacent,
for i , j ∈ {1, . . . , n}, ai is adjacent to b j if and only if i = j,
for i , j ∈ {1, . . . , n}, c i is adjacent to d j if and only if i = j,
for i , j ∈ {1, . . . , n}, ai is adjacent to c j if and only if i = j,
for i , j ∈ {1, . . . , n}, ai is adjacent to d j if and only if i = j,
for i , j ∈ {1, . . . , n}, b i is adjacent to c j if and only if i = j,
for i , j ∈ {1, . . . , n}, b i is adjacent to d j if and only if i = j.

Then G n are graphs of parallel-square type deﬁned in [2], and therefore the graphs G n are clawfree. For every n, | V (G n )| = 4n + 4. Since {a1 , d1 , x} is a triad, each G n contains a triad. It is easy to
see that all G n are connected. We also observe that G n \ {x, y , z, w } contains no triad, so χ (G n )
| V (G n )|−4
= 2n. On the other hand, ω(G n ) = n + 2 (we leave checking this to the reader), and so
2

(2 − n+4 2 )ω(G n ). Thus {G n } is an inﬁnite family of graphs satisfying the hypotheses of 1.1,
with the ratio between the chromatic number and the clique number arbitrarily close to 2.
Finally, we show that 1.2 is tight. Let G n = G n \ {x, y , z, w }. Then G n is an induced subgraph of G n ,
and G n contains no triad. Since | V (G n )| = 4n, it follows that χ (G n )
2n. It is easy to see that
ω(G n ) = n, and therefore χ (G n ) = 2ω(G n ).

5. Choosability
The goal of this section is to prove the following:
5.1. Let G be tame, and assume that G is not a thickening of ( H , ∅) for any Schläﬂi-antiprismatic graph H .
Then ch(G ) 2ω(G ).
Unfortunately, we do not know what the correct bound on ch(G ) is if G is a thickening of ( H , ∅) for
some Schläﬂi-antiprismatic graph H . It may be true that the bound of 5.1 holds for all tame graphs,
but we do not know how to prove it. We start with a lemma (we thank Bruce Reed for helping us
with the proof).

| V (G )|

Proof. Let p = max(χ (G ), 2 ). Then G can be coloured with p colours. For a p-colouring c of G,
let the index of c be the number of colour classes of size two in c. Let c be a colouring of G with
maximum index, and let X 1 , . . . , X p be the colour classes of c.

| V (G )|

Suppose | X 1 | 3. Since p
, it follows that | X i | 1 for some i ∈ {2, . . . , p }, and we may assume
2
that i = 2. Since G is claw-free, at most two vertices of X 1 have neighbours in X 2 , and so some vertex
y ∈ X 1 is anticomplete to X 2 . But now

X 1 \ { y },

X 2 ∪ { y },

X3, . . . , X p

is a p-colouring of G with index bigger than that of c, a contradiction. This proves (1).
It follows from (1) that G is a subgraph (not necessarily induced) of the complete p-partite graph
K (2, . . . , 2). By a theorem from [4], the choice number of the p-partite graph K (2, . . . , 2) is p, and
therefore ch(G ) p. This proves 5.2. ✷
5.2 has the following easy corollary:

We also need the following:
5.4. Let H be a Schläﬂi-antiprismatic graph and let G be a thickening of ( H , ∅). Then the set of non-neighbours
of every vertex of G is the union of two cliques.
Proof. Let u ∈ V (G ). Let i , j ∈ {1, 2, 3} and let r ij , sij , t ij be as in the deﬁnition of the Schläﬂi graph.
Then V ( H ) ⊆ {r ij , sij , t ij : 1

T ij . From the symmetry of the Schläﬂi graph [1], we may assume that u ∈ S 11 . Let M be the set of

non-neighbours of u in G. Then M = ( i =1 ( T i1 ∪ R 1i )) ∪ S 22 ∪ S 32 ∪ S 23 ∪ S 33 , and R 11 ∪ R 21 ∪ T 31 ∪ S 22 ∪ S 32
and R 31 ∪ T 11 ∪ T 21 ∪ S 23 ∪ S 33 are two cliques with union M. This proves 5.4. ✷
We can now prove 5.1.
Proof of 5.1. Let G be tame and not a thickening of ( H , ∅) for any Schläﬂi-antiprismatic graph H .
The proof is by induction on | V (G )|, and so we may assume that if G = G is a proper induced
subgraph of G, such that G is not a thickening of ( H , ∅) for any Schläﬂi-antiprismatic graph H ,
then ch(G ) 2ω(G ). Since G is not a thickening of ( H , ∅) for any Schläﬂi-antiprismatic graph H , it
follows from 3.3 that either

• G has two bisimplicial vertices, or
• ω(G ) | V (4G )| .
| V (G )|

, then 5.1 follows from 5.3. Thus we may assume that
If ω(G )

By 5.4, the set of non-neighbours of u in G is the union of two cliques. Since u is bisimplicial, it
follows that N G (u ) ∪ {u } is the union of two cliques. Consequently, V (G ) is the union of four cliques,

ω(G )

Now, it follows from (1) and the inductive hypothesis that ch(G )

2ω(G ), and 2.2 implies that

6. Colouring the complement
In this section we prove 1.8.
Proof of 1.8. We may assume that G is connected. Let k be the maximum size of a stable set in G. To
prove 1.1 we need to show that V (G ) is the union of 2k cliques. If k = 2, then 1.8 follows from 1.7,
and so we may assume that k 3. Let X be a stable set of size k in G. Since G is claw-free, every
vertex of V (G ) \ X has one or two neighbours in X . Deﬁne a new graph H X with vertex set X and
such that vertices h1 , h2 ∈ X are adjacent in H X if in G they have a common neighbour in V (G ) \ X .
(1) X can be chosen so that H X is connected.
Choose a pair ( X , C ), where C is a component of H X , with | V (C )| maximum over all such pairs. We
claim that H X is connected. Since C is a component of H , it follows that in G, no vertex v ∈ V (G ) \ X
has both a neighbour in V (C ) and a neighbour in X \ V (C ). Since G is connected, there exist two
adjacent vertices a, b ∈ V (G ) \ X , such that a has a neighbour in V (C ) and b has a neighbour in
X \ V (C ). Since {a, b, c 1 , c 2 } is not a claw in G for distinct c 1 , c 2 ∈ N (a) ∩ V (C ), we deduce that
| N (a) ∩ V (C )| = 1 and similarly | N (b) ∩ ( X \ V (C ))| = 1. Let a be the neighbour of a in V (C ) and let
b be the neighbour of b in X \ V (C ). Now X = X ∪ {b} \ {b } is a stable set of size k in G, and the set
V (C ) ∪ b is connected in H X , contrary to the choice of ( X , C ). This proves (1).
Let X be a stable set of size k in G such that H = H X is connected. For a vertex x ∈ X denote
by A (x) the set of vertices in V (G ) \ X adjacent to x and to no other vertex of X . For an edge xy
of H denote by A (xy ) the set of vertices in V (G ) \ X adjacent to both x and y. Let A [x] = A (x) ∪
( xy∈ E ( H ) A (xy )).
(2) Let x be a vertex of H and let y 1 , . . . , yn be the neighbours of x in H with n
is the union of two cliques.

1. Then {x} ∪ ( A [x] \ A (xy 1 ))

Since xy 1 ∈ E ( H ), it follows that A (xy 1 ) = ∅. Suppose u , v ∈ A [x] \ A (xy 1 ) are non-adjacent. Since
{x, u , v , a} is a claw in G for every a ∈ A (xy 1 ) \ ( N (u ) ∪ N ( v )), it follows that A (xy 1 ) ⊆ of N (u ) ∪ N ( v ).
Since {a, u , v , y 1 } is a claw for every a ∈ A (xy 1 )∩ N (u )∩ N ( v ), it follows that A (xy 1 )∩ N (u )∩ N ( v ) = ∅.
So every vertex in A (xy 1 ) is adjacent to exactly one of u , v and A [x] \ A (xy 1 ) is the union of two
cliques by 1.5. Since every vertex of A [x] \ A (xy 1 ) is adjacent to x, it follows that {x} ∪ A [x] \ A (xy 1 )
is the union of two cliques. This proves (2).
(3) If H is not a tree then the theorem holds.
Let C be a cycle in H . Let H be a maximal subgraph of H with V ( H ) = V ( H ), such that C is the
unique cycle in H . Direct the edges of H so that C is a directed cycle and every path with an end in
V (C ) and no other vertex in V (C ) is directed away from C . By (2) for every edge ab of H directed
from b to a, the set of vertices of V (G ) \ X adjacent to a and not to b, together with {a}, is the union
of two cliques. Also, since every vertex of V (G ) \ X has a neighbour in X , and no vertex of V (G ) \ X
is complete to V (C ) (since V (C ) is a stable set of size at least three in G), it follows that for every
vertex v ∈ V (G ) \ X , there exists an edge ab of H directed from b to a such that v is adjacent to a
and not b. But now, by (2), V (G ) is the union of 2| E ( H )| 2| V ( H )| = 2k cliques and the theorem
holds. This proves (3).

572

M. Chudnovsky, P. Seymour / Journal of Combinatorial Theory, Series B 100 (2010) 560–572

By (3) we may assume that H is a tree. Since | X | 3, it follows that some vertex of H has degree
at least 2. Let r be a vertex of degree at least two in H . Direct the edges of H so that r has in-degree
zero, and every path of H starting at r is a directed path. Then every vertex x ∈ X \ {r } has exactly one
in-neighbour. Denote this in-neighbour by i (x). Since X is a maximum stable set in G, and | X | 3, it
follows that every vertex of V (G ) \ X has both a neighbour and a non-neighbour in X . Therefore, for
every vertex v ∈ V (G ) \ X , either v is adjacent to r, or there exists x ∈ X \ {r }, such that v is adjacent
to x and non-adjacent to i (x).
Now

{x} ∪ A [x] \ A xi (x)

V (G ) =

∪ {r } ∪ A [r ].

x∈ X \{r }

Applying (2) twice we deduce that A [r ] ∪ {r } is the union of four cliques. Let L be the set of leaves
of H . Then | L | 2. By the deﬁnition of H no vertex of V (G ) \ X is adjacent to two members of L,
and by the maximality of X , for all x ∈ L the set ({x} ∪ A [x]) \ A (xi (x)) = {x} ∪ A (x) is a clique. By (2)
applied to each x ∈ X \ ( L ∪ {r }), it follows that {x} ∪ ( A [x] \ A (xi (x))) is the union of two cliques. So
V (G ) is the union of 2(k − 1 − | L |) + 4 + | L | = 2k + 2 − | L | 2k cliques. This completes the proof
of 1.8. ✷
We remark that the constant 2 in 1.8 is best possible. For every positive integer n, let G n be the line
graph of the compete graph on 2n + 1 vertices. Then G n is claw-free, the size of the maximum stable
set in G n is n and χ (G n ) = 2n − 1. This suggests that χ (G ) may be bounded above by 2ω(G ) − 1
for every tame graph G. However, this is false, since if G is the Schläﬂi graph, then ω(G ) = 3 and
χ (G ) = 6.
There remains an obvious question: can we bound the choice number of complements of tame
graphs by some function of their clique number? Next we construct a family of graphs that shows
that no such function exists, and so there is no analogue of 5.1 for complements of tame graphs.
Let G n be deﬁned as follows. Let V (G n ) = A n ∪ B n ∪ { v n } where A n and B n are disjoint cliques and
vn ∈
/ An ∪ B n . Moreover, there exist xn ∈ An and yn , zn ∈ B such that xn yn , zn v n ∈ E (G n ), and there
are no other edges in G n . Then G n is a tame graph, ω(G n ) = 3, and, since G n contains the complete
bipartite graph K n−1,n−1 , it follows that ch(G n ) tends to inﬁnity with n.
