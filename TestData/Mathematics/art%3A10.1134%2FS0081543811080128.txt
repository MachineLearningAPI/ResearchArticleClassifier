Abstract—Several rigidity problems in toric topology are addressed in the survey paper by the
second and third authors, “Classiﬁcation Problems of Toric Manifolds via Topology” (in Toric
Topology, Am. Math. Soc., Providence, RI, 2008, pp. 273–286). In the present paper, we survey
the results on those problems including recent developments.

1. INTRODUCTION
As is well known, the cohomology ring does not distinguish closed smooth manifolds up to
diﬀeomorphism or homeomorphism in general. However, it does if we restrict our attention to a
reasonably small class of objects. For instance, simply connected closed smooth 4-manifolds are
classiﬁed up to homeomorphism by Freedman [21] using their integral cohomology rings.
In the proceedings of the 2006 Osaka conference on toric topology, the second and third authors [35] proposed a rather bold question asking whether the class of toric manifolds is topologically
determined by their integral cohomology rings. In fact, the cohomological rigidity problem for toric
manifolds is whether two toric manifolds are homeomorphic or even diﬀeomorphic if their integral
cohomology rings are isomorphic as graded rings.
The aﬃrmative solution to the problem seems implausible at ﬁrst glance, but no example providing the negative solution to the problem has been found yet. Instead, during the last ﬁve years,
many results supporting the aﬃrmative solution to the problem have appeared. In order to solve
the problem, we either look for an example for the negative solution, or prove a general statement
for the positive solution to the problem. For the latter, the class of toric manifolds seems too large
to handle at once. Therefore, it is reasonable to focus further down on a smaller subclass of toric
manifolds to get any aﬃrmative results.
So far, all aﬃrmative results are on (generalized) Bott manifolds, and these results are surveyed
in Section 2. See Section 2 for the deﬁnition of (generalized) Bott manifolds. Even though there
are several results on cohomological rigidity for (generalized) Bott manifolds, it is still open, and it
will be interesting to settle the problem for them.
The notion of quasitoric manifold is introduced in [18] as a topological analogue of toric manifolds. See Section 3 for the deﬁnition of quasitoric manifold. In particular, all projective toric
manifolds are quasitoric manifolds, but the converse is not always true. A similar cohomological
rigidity problem can be raised for quasitoric manifolds, and so far, all the aﬃrmative results are
found for quasitoric manifolds over products of simplices, i.e., quasitoric manifolds whose orbit

spaces are products of simplices. Note that a (generalized) Bott manifold is an example of a
quasitoric manifold over a product of simplices.
The quasitoric manifold is not the only topological analogue of the toric manifold. In fact, the
topological toric manifold is deﬁned in [28], and, in particular, all toric manifolds and quasitoric
manifolds are topological toric manifolds. Therefore, the topological toric manifold can be considered as the correct topological analogue of the toric manifold. A cohomological rigidity problem for
topological toric manifolds can be raised similarly, but so far there is no results on this problem
except for those for toric or quasitoric manifolds discussed above. The torus manifold deﬁned in [24]
and [32] is a further generalization of the toric manifold; however, the class of torus manifolds is
too large to be cohomologically rigid. The developments on rigidity of quasitoric, topological toric,
and torus manifolds are surveyed in Section 3. We also mention some rigidity result for symplectic
toric manifolds there.
In Section 4, real versions of toric and quasitoric manifolds (called small covers for the latter)
and their corresponding cohomological rigidity problems are discussed. In these cases, however, the
integral cohomology is quite diﬃcult to calculate, so the rigidity problems with integral cohomology are intractable. Instead, we consider cohomology with Z/2-coeﬃcients to get any reasonable
results. Notable results in this case are the complete settlement of cohomological rigidity for real
(generalized) Bott manifolds in [29] and [33]. Namely, the answer to the problem is aﬃrmative for
real Bott manifolds, but negative for generalized real Bott manifolds.
In the strong cohomological rigidity problem for toric manifolds one asks whether an isomorphism between the cohomology rings of two toric manifolds is induced from a homeomorphism or
a diﬀeomorphism between the manifolds. The strong cohomological rigidity problem for quasitoric
or topological toric manifolds can be formulated similarly, but note that this problem with diffeomorphism has the negative answer as shown by Friedman and Morgan [22]. There are some
positive results for the problem with diﬀeomorphism, and these together with some related results
are surveyed in Section 5.
Toric manifolds and quasitoric manifolds are associated with combinatorial objects which are
simplicial complexes and simple convex polytopes, respectively. Even though there are some counterexamples, often such combinatorial objects are completely determined by the cohomology rings
of the associated manifolds, and in this case such simplicial complexes or polytopes are said to be
(cohomologically) rigid. For such combinatorial objects, the rigidity problem is to determine (cohomologically) rigid complexes or polytopes, and results on this problem are discussed in Section 6.
Over ﬁve years since the ﬁrst announcement of the cohomological rigidity problem, many interesting results have been found, but still the complete solution to the problem is far from being
settled. For this, some new insight might be needed, but we hope some enlightening new discoveries
will be made in the near future.
2. COHOMOLOGICAL RIGIDITY PROBLEM FOR TORIC MANIFOLDS
A toric variety of complex dimension n is a normal algebraic variety over the complex numbers C
with an eﬀective algebraic action of (C∗ )n having an open dense orbit, where C∗ = C \ {0}. On
the other hand, a fan of real dimension n is a collection of cones in Rn with the origin as the
vertex satisfying certain conditions. A fundamental theorem in toric geometry says that there is a
bijective correspondence between toric varieties of complex dimension n and fans of real dimension n
(see [23] and [37] for details). Therefore, the classiﬁcation of toric varieties as varieties reduces to
the classiﬁcation of fans, and through this correspondence compact non-singular toric varieties,
which we call toric manifolds in this paper, are classiﬁed in some cases (see [35, Sect. 3]).
However, little is known about the diﬀeomorphism or homeomorphism classiﬁcation of toric
manifolds. As is well known, the cohomology ring H ∗ (X; Z) of a toric manifold X is explicitly

described in terms of the fan associated with X; i.e., H ∗ (X; Z) is the face ring of the underlying
simplicial complex of the fan modulo a linear system of parameters; in particular, H ∗ (X; Z) is
generated by degree 2 elements as a graded ring. See [23, p. 106] or [37, p. 134] for the precise
description of the cohomology ring of toric manifolds. The cohomology ring does not distinguish
closed smooth manifolds in general, but we have a feeling that most of closed smooth manifolds do
not have the symmetry of a large torus. Based on this feeling and by checking some examples, the
second and third authors addressed the following problem in [35].
Cohomological rigidity problem for toric manifolds. Are two toric manifolds diﬀeomorphic or homeomorphic if their cohomology rings with Z-coeﬃcients are isomorphic as graded rings?
A toric manifold of complex dimension 1 is CP1 . Toric manifolds of complex dimension 2 are
known to be CP2 , Hirzebruch surfaces and their blow-ups (see [23] or [37]). It is not diﬃcult to
check that the answer to the cohomological rigidity problem is aﬃrmative for those manifolds. The
problem is open in higher dimensions but some partial aﬃrmative solutions are obtained, which we
survey below.

where each πi : Bi → Bi−1 for i = 1, . . . , n is the projectivization of a Whitney sum of two complex
line bundles over Bi−1 . We call Bi an i-stage Bott manifold or a Bott manifold of height i. It is not
diﬃcult to see that all Bott manifolds are toric manifolds. We are concerned with the diﬀeomorphism
classiﬁcation of n-stage Bott manifolds Bn . Even if two Bott towers of height n are diﬀerent, their
n-stage Bott manifolds Bn can be diﬀeomorphic. For example, two-stage Bott manifolds B2 are
Hirzebruch surfaces, and there are only two diﬀeomorphism types, (CP1 )2 and CP2 #CP2 , among
them, although there are inﬁnite choices of ﬁbrations π2 : B2 → B1 = CP1 for each diﬀeomorphism
type of B2 . The following theorem is proved in [11] for n = 3 and recently proved by the ﬁrst author
in [4] for n = 4.
Theorem 2.1 [11, 4]. The answer to the cohomological rigidity problem with diﬀeomorphism
is aﬃrmative for n-stage Bott manifolds when n ≤ 4.
If all the ﬁbrations in (2.1) are trivial, then Bn is diﬀeomorphic to (CP1 )n , and, hence,
∼
= H ∗ ((CP1 )n ; Z) as graded rings. The following theorem shows that the converse holds.
Theorem 2.2 [34]. All the ﬁbrations in (2.1) are trivial and, in particular, Bn is diﬀeomorphic
to (CP1 )n if H ∗ (Bn ; Z) ∼
= H ∗ ((CP1 )n ; Z) as graded rings.
We say that Bn is Q-trivial if H ∗ (Bn ; Q) ∼
= H ∗ ((CP1 )n ; Q) as graded rings. As remarked above,

H ∗ (Bn ; Z)

there are only two diﬀeomorphism types among Hirzebruch surfaces: one is (CP1 )2 and the other
is CP2 #CP2 , and both of them can be easily seen to be Q-trivial. This motivated us to study
Q-trivial Bott manifolds, although there are inﬁnitely many n-stage Bott manifolds which are not
Q-trivial when n ≥ 3.
Theorem 2.3 [9]. The answer to the cohomological rigidity problem with diﬀeomorphism is afﬁrmative for Q-trivial Bott manifolds. Moreover, there are p(n) diﬀeomorphism classes in Q-trivial
n-stage Bott manifolds, where p(n) denotes the number of partitions of n.
We say that the Bott tower (2.1) is k-twisted if there are exactly k non-trivial topological
ﬁbrations in the tower. The number k is apparently an invariant of the tower. However, it is not
obvious that the number k is independent of the choice of Bott tower structures for a Bott manifold.
Indeed, for a Bott manifold Bn , there might be two diﬀerent Bott towers whose last stage is Bn .
Therefore, the twist number k for a Bott manifold may not be well deﬁned. But the twist number
for a Bott manifold is, indeed, well deﬁned, and is actually an invariant of H ∗ (Bn ) (see [15]).

Theorem 2.4 [15]. The answer to the cohomological rigidity problem with diﬀeomorphism is
aﬃrmative for Bott manifolds with one twist.
Since πi : Bi → Bi−1 has a cross section, the induced homomorphism πi∗ : H ∗ (Bi−1 ; Z) →
H ∗ (Bi ; Z) is injective for each i. Therefore, H ∗ (Bi−1 ; Z) can be regarded as a subring of H ∗ (Bi ; Z)
via πi∗ , so that we have a ﬁltration by subrings:
H ∗ (Bn ; Z) ⊃ H ∗ (Bn−1 ; Z) ⊃ . . . ⊃ H ∗ (B1 ; Z) ⊃ H ∗ (B0 ; Z).

be another Bott tower of height n. We say that two Bott towers (2.1) and (2.2) are isomorphic if there
is a collection of diﬀeomorphisms {fi : Bi → Bi }ni=1 which commute with the projections {πi }ni=1
and {πi }ni=1 . An isomorphism between Bott towers induces an isomorphism of their cohomology
rings preserving the ﬁltrations. The following shows that the converse is also true.
Theorem 2.5 [27]. Any graded ring isomorphism between the cohomology rings of n-stage Bott
manifolds with Z-coeﬃcients preserving the ﬁltrations can be realized by an isomorphism between
the Bott towers of height n.
2.2. Generalized Bott manifolds. The notion of Bott tower and Bott manifold can naturally be generalized. A generalized Bott tower of height n is a sequence of CPmi -bundles with
mi ≥ 1:

where each πi : Bi → Bi−1 for i = 1, . . . , n is the projectivization of a Whitney sum of mi + 1
complex line bundles over Bi−1 . We call Bi an i-stage generalized Bott manifold or a generalized
Bott manifold of height i. They are also toric manifolds. Similarly to the case of Bott manifolds, we
are concerned with the diﬀeomorphism classiﬁcation of n-stage generalized Bott manifolds Bn , and
they can be diﬀeomorphic even if the towers are diﬀerent. The variety classiﬁcation of two-stage
generalized Bott manifolds is completed by Kleischmidt [30], and their diﬀeomorphism classiﬁcation
is done by the authors in [11]. As a corollary of the latter result we have
Theorem 2.6 [11]. The answer to the cohomological rigidity problem with diﬀeomorphism is

for other toric manifolds.
3. TOPOLOGICAL ANALOGUES OF TORIC MANIFOLDS
3.1. Quasitoric manifolds. Around 1990 Davis and Januszkiewicz [18] introduced what is
now called a quasitoric manifold (see [1]), which is a topological analogue of a toric manifold.
A quasitoric manifold is a closed smooth manifold M of even dimension, say 2n, with an eﬀective

smooth action of (S 1 )n , satisfying the following two conditions:
(1) M is locally equivariantly diﬀeomorphic to a representation space of (S 1 )n ,
(2) the orbit space M/(S 1 )n is a simple convex polytope.
We say that M is a quasitoric manifold over a simple polytope Q when Q = M/(S 1 )n .
A toric manifold X of complex dimension n with the restricted action of (S 1 )n is quasitoric in
many cases. In fact, this is the case when X is projective, and it is not known whether there is
a toric manifold X which is not quasitoric. One can see that the restricted action of (S 1 )n on X
satisﬁes condition (1) above so that the orbit space X/(S 1 )n is a manifold with corners. Moreover,
since the action of (S 1 )n on X is the restriction of the action of (C∗ )n , the orbit space X/(S 1 )n
has the residual action of (C∗ )n /(S 1 )n ∼
= Rn . This implies that all faces of X/(S 1 )n (even X/(S 1 )n
itself) are contractible, and any intersection of faces is connected unless it is empty, so the orbit
space looks like a simple polytope. However, the orbit space might not be a simple polytope and
there might exist a toric manifold which is not quasitoric.
On the other hand, there are many quasitoric manifolds which do not arise from toric manifolds.
For example, CP2 #CP2 with some smooth action of (S 1 )2 is quasitoric but not toric because it
does not allow a complex (even almost complex) structure, as is well known.
The cohomological rigidity problem is also addressed for quasitoric manifolds in [35]. We note
that an n-stage Bott manifold with the restricted compact torus action is a quasitoric manifold
over an n-cube; more generally, an n-stage generalized Bott manifold in (2.3) with the restricted
compact torus action is a quasitoric manifold over a product of simplices ni=1 Δmi where Δmi
denotes an mi -simplex (see [12, 20]). Most of quasitoric manifolds over a product of simplices are
generalized Bott manifolds, but there are quasitoric manifolds over a product of simplices which
are not generalized Bott manifolds. For instance, CP2 #CP2 with some smooth action of (S 1 )2 is a
quasitoric manifold over a square but not toric as remarked before, in particular, not a Bott manifold.
Theorem 3.1 [14]. Quasitoric manifolds over a product of two simplices are homeomorphic
if their cohomology rings with Z-coeﬃcients are isomorphic. Moreover, if we ﬁx a product of two
simplices, denoted Q, then there are only ﬁnitely many quasitoric manifolds over Q which are not
generalized Bott manifolds.
Remark 3.2. The ﬁrst statement in the theorem above depends on Proposition 1.8 in [18],
which holds up to equivariant homeomorphism. This is the reason why the ﬁrst statement is stated
as homeomorphic.
3.2. Topological toric manifolds. Recently, H. Ishida, Y. Fukukawa and the second author [28] have introduced another topological analogue of toric manifolds, called topological toric
manifolds. It is known that a toric manifold of complex dimension n is covered by ﬁnitely many
invariant open subsets each equivariantly and algebraically isomorphic to a direct sum of complex
one-dimensional algebraic representation spaces of (C∗ )n . Based on this observation a topological
toric manifold is deﬁned as follows.
Deﬁnition 3.3. A closed smooth manifold X of dimension 2n with an eﬀective smooth action
of (C∗ )n having an open dense orbit is a (compact) topological toric manifold if it is covered by
ﬁnitely many invariant open subsets each equivariantly diﬀeomorphic to a direct sum of complex
one-dimensional smooth representation spaces of (C∗ )n .
To a topological toric manifold X, one can associate a combinatorial object Δ(X) called a
complete non-singular topological fan similarly to the toric case. The main theorem in [28] says
that the correspondence X → Δ(X) is a bijection between topological toric manifolds and complete
non-singular topological fans.
Apparently from the deﬁnition, a toric manifold is a topological toric manifold. But topological
toric manifolds turn out to be much more abundant than toric manifolds because there are many

smooth representations of (C∗ )n that are not algebraic. This stems from the fact that since C∗ =
R>0 × S 1 as smooth groups, any smooth endomorphism of C∗ is of the form
g → |g|b+

and this endomorphism is algebraic if and only if b = v and c = 0. Therefore the group Hom(C∗ , C∗ )
of smooth endomorphisms of C∗ is isomorphic to C × Z, while the group Homalg (C∗ , C∗ ) of algebraic
endomorphisms of C∗ is isomorphic to Z.
Nevertheless, some topological properties of topological toric manifolds are similar to those of
toric manifolds. For instance, the orbit space of a topological toric manifold X by the restricted
compact torus action is a manifold with corners whose faces (even the orbit space itself) are all
contractible and any intersection of faces is connected unless it is empty, so the orbit space looks
like a simple polytope similarly to the toric case. However, it is shown in [28] that the orbit space
is not necessarily a simple polytope and the family of topological toric manifolds with restricted
compact torus actions is strictly larger than the family of quasitoric manifolds up to equivariant
homeomorphism. One can also see that H ∗ (X; Z) has the same presentation as in the toric or
quasitoric case, i.e., a Stanley–Reisner ring modulo a linear system of parameters; in particular,
H ∗ (X; Z) is generated as a ring by degree 2 elements as in the toric or quasitoric case. Therefore,
it is reasonable to address the cohomological rigidity problem for topological toric manifolds.
Cohomological rigidity problem for topological toric manifolds. Are two topological
toric manifolds diﬀeomorphic or homeomorphic if their cohomology rings with Z-coeﬃcients are
isomorphic as graded rings?
So far, no counterexample to this problem is known.
3.3. Torus manifolds. Hattori and Masuda [24] introduced a torus manifold (or unitary
toric manifold in an earlier terminology [32]), which is a closed, smooth manifold of dimension 2n
with an eﬀective smooth action of (S 1 )n having a ﬁxed point, and developed a theory analogous
to toric geometry for torus manifolds to some extent. Topological toric manifolds with restricted
compact torus actions are torus manifolds, so the class of torus manifolds is most general. However,
this class seems too general to study. For instance, there are many torus manifolds which are not
simply connected and have non-trivial odd degree cohomology, although topological toric manifolds
are simply connected and their cohomology rings are generated by degree 2 elements as mentioned
before. Moreover, torus manifolds are not cohomologically rigid even if they are simply connected
and have vanishing odd degree cohomology, as is shown in the following example.
Example 3.4 (S. Kuroki). Let M = CP1 × S 2 and M = S 3 ×S 1 S(C ⊕ R2 −1 ) where S 1 acts
on S 3 freely in a natural way, on C as scalar multiplication, on R2 −1 trivially and S(·) stands for
the unit sphere. One can easily see that both M and M admit smooth actions of (S 1 ) +1 so that
they become torus manifolds. Moreover, they are simply connected, have isomorphic cohomology
rings with Z-coeﬃcients and their odd degree cohomology groups vanish. However, M is spin while
M is non-spin as is easily checked, so they are not diﬀeomorphic, even not homotopy equivalent.
Nevertheless, the topological classiﬁcation problem for torus manifolds is still interesting. Let
G be a compact, connected Lie group with maximal torus (S 1 )n . It is shown in [31] that if a torus
manifold has a codimension 1 extended G-action, then it is a product of even-dimensional spheres
and the following manifolds:

S 2m+1 ×S 1 S Ckρ ⊕ R2

(m, k, ∈ N, ρ ∈ Z),

(3.2)

where P (·) stands for projectivization, S(·) stands for the unit sphere as before, and S 1 acts on
S 2m+1 naturally, and on Cρ through the group homomorphism S 1 → S 1 deﬁned by t → tρ . We note

that manifolds of the former type in (3.2) are special two-stage generalized Bott manifolds, so they
are distinguished by their cohomology rings up to diﬀeomorphism by Theorem 2.6. Manifolds of
the latter type in (3.2) are two-stage generalized Bott manifolds if and only if k = = 1, and unless
k = = 1, their cohomology rings are not generated by degree 2 elements. Those manifolds are not
necessarily distinguished by their cohomology rings up to diﬀeomorphism as is seen in Example 3.4,
and more invariants are necessary to distinguish them.
Theorem 3.5 [8]. Two manifolds of the latter type in (3.2) are diﬀeomorphic if there is a
cohomology ring isomorphism preserving their Stiefel–Whitney classes and Pontrjagin classes.
Looking at this result, it is natural to ask the following.
Problem 3.6. What is the most general class in torus manifolds whose topological types are
classiﬁed by their cohomology rings and their Stiefel–Whitney and Pontrjagin characteristic classes?
3.4. Symplectic toric manifolds. A symplectic toric manifold (or a toric symplectic manifold) is a closed connected symplectic manifold of even dimension, say 2n, with an eﬀective Hamiltonian action of (S 1 )n . A symplectic toric manifold is known to be equivariantly diﬀeomorphic
to a projective toric manifold with restricted compact torus action [19]. Recently, an analogous
cohomological rigidity problem has been studied by D. McDuﬀ for symplectic toric manifolds.
Theorem 3.7 (Borisov–McDuﬀ [36]). Let R be a commutative ring of ﬁnite rank with even
grading, and write RR := R ⊗Z R. Suppose given elements [ω] ∈ RR and c1 , c2 ∈ R of degrees 2,
2 and 4, respectively. Then, up to equivariant symplectomorphism, there are at most ﬁnitely many
symplectic toric manifolds (M, ω) for which there is a ring isomorphism Ψ : H ∗ (M ; Z) → R that
takes the symplectic class and the Chern classes ci (M ), i = 1, 2, to the given elements [ω] ∈ RR
and ci ∈ R.
4. REAL VERSION
4.1. Real toric manifolds. The set of real points in a toric manifold X is called a real toric
manifold and denoted by X(R). For instance, when X = CPn , X(R) = RPn . We may address the
cohomological rigidity problem for real toric manifolds, but H ∗ (X(R); Z) seems complicated and
unknown in general, so it seems not practical to study the problem, although the authors do not
know any counterexample to it. However, it is known that
H ∗ (X(R); Z/2) ∼
= H 2∗ (X; Z) ⊗Z Z/2 = H 2∗ (X; Z/2),
so that H ∗ (X(R); Z/2) can be described in terms of the fan associated with X since H ∗ (X; Z)
can. For this reason the cohomological rigidity problem for real toric manifolds was addressed with
Z/2-coeﬃcients in [29], and it is shown there that the answer to the problem is aﬃrmative for real
Bott manifolds, where a real Bott manifold is the real analogue of a Bott manifold obtained by
replacing C in (2.1) by R.
Theorem 4.1 [29]. Real Bott manifolds are diﬀeomorphic if their cohomology rings with Z/2coeﬃcients are isomorphic as graded rings.
Real Bott manifolds provide examples of ﬂat riemannian manifolds. The theorem above has
been reproved and improved in [10]. Paper [10] also relates real Bott manifolds to acyclic digraphs
(directed graphs with no directed cycle), and shows that the classiﬁcation of real Bott manifolds
of dimension n up to diﬀeomorphism corresponds to the classiﬁcation of non-isomorphic acyclic
digraphs on n vertices up to two graph operations where one is a well-known operation called a
local complementation and the other seems to be a new operation. Using this correspondence, the
number of diﬀeomorphism classes of real Bott manifolds is explicitly counted up to dimension 8 (see
Table 1). Some of real Bott manifolds are orientable and some of orientable ones admit a symplectic

form. There are criteria of whether a real Bott manifold is orientable [29] or symplectic [26], and
using those criteria, one can also count the number of diﬀeomorphism classes of orientable or
symplectic real Bott manifolds for low dimensions (see also Table 1).
Paper [10] also proves the following.
Theorem 4.2 (unique decomposition property). The decomposition of a real Bott manifold
into a product of indecomposable real Bott manifolds is unique up to permutations of the indecomposable factors.
Here a real Bott manifold is said to be indecomposable if it is not diﬀeomorphic to a product of
two real Bott manifolds of positive dimension. Since S 1 is a real Bott manifold RP1 , Theorem 4.2
implies the following corollary.
Corollary 4.3 (cancellation property). Let M and M be real Bott manifolds. If S 1 × M and
S 1 × M are diﬀeomorphic, then so are M and M .
As mentioned before, real Bott manifolds are compact ﬂat riemannian manifolds. We note that
the cancellation property above does not hold for general compact ﬂat riemannian manifolds [3].
These results imply that toric or real toric manifolds would have some rigidity properties, and it
would be interesting to ﬁnd them.
The real analogue of a generalized Bott manifold obtained by replacing C by R in (2.3) is called a
generalized real Bott manifold. Looking at Theorem 4.1 and Theorem 2.6, the readers might expect
that Theorem 4.1 can be extended to generalized real Bott manifolds, but the diﬀeomorphism classes
of two-stage generalized real Bott manifolds are not necessarily distinguished by their cohomology
rings with Z/2-coeﬃcients [33]. However, if two two-stage generalized real Bott manifolds are
homotopy equivalent, then they are diﬀeomorphic [33]. Therefore, we may ask the following.
Homotopical rigidity problem for real toric manifolds. Are two real toric manifolds diffeomorphic or homeomorphic if they are homotopy equivalent?
Real toric manifolds are not simply connected and they are often aspherical manifolds. Therefore, we may think of the problem above as a real toric version of the famous Borel conjecture on
aspherical manifolds.
4.2. Small covers. The notion of small cover was introduced by Davis and Januszkiewicz [18]
as a real analogue of a quasitoric manifold. It is a closed smooth manifold N of dimension n with
an eﬀective smooth action of (S 0 )n satisfying the following two conditions:
(1) N is locally equivariantly diﬀeomorphic to a representation space of (S 0 )n ,
(2) the orbit space N/(S 0 )n is a simple convex polytope.
We say that N is a small cover over a simple polytope Q when Q = N/(S 0 )n . Generalized real Bott
manifolds are small covers over a product of simplices, and conversely, a small cover over a product
of simplices is homeomorphic to a generalized real Bott manifold [11]. Similarly to the relation
between toric manifolds and quasitoric manifolds, it is uncertain that any real toric manifold is a
small cover but there are many small covers which are not real toric.

One can also address the cohomological rigidity problem for small covers N . Similarly to the
real toric case, H ∗ (N ; Z) is not well understood but H ∗ (N ; Z/2) is explicitly described. Therefore,
the cohomological rigidity problem is formulated for small covers with Z/2-coeﬃcients as before.
The answer to this problem is aﬃrmative for small covers over an n-cube (i.e., real Bott manifolds)
by Theorem 4.1 but is not always aﬃrmative because two-stage generalized real Bott manifolds are
not distinguished by their cohomology rings with Z/2-coeﬃcients as mentioned before. However,
the following is known.
Theorem 4.4 [2]. Small covers over a product of an m-gon and an interval are distinguished
up to homeomorphism by their cohomology rings with Z/2-coeﬃcients.
Remark 4.5. We may replace “homeomorphism” above by “diﬀeomorphism” since they are
equivalent in dimension 3 as is well known.
Looking at these results, it is natural to ask the following.
Problem 4.6. For which simple polytope Q are small covers over Q distinguished up to homeomorphism or diﬀeomorphism by their cohomology rings with Z/2-coeﬃcients?
Finally, we remark that it is not known whether two small covers are homeomorphic or diﬀeomorphic if they are homotopy equivalent.
4.3. Real topological toric manifolds. A real analogue of topological toric manifolds has
also been introduced in [28].
Deﬁnition 4.7. A closed smooth manifold Y of dimension n with an eﬀective smooth action
of (R∗ )n having an open dense orbit is called a (compact) real topological toric manifold if it is
covered by ﬁnitely many invariant open subsets each equivariantly diﬀeomorphic to a direct sum of
real one-dimensional smooth representation spaces of (R∗ )n .
Similarly to the complex case, the family of real topological toric manifolds properly contains
the family of real toric manifolds. Moreover, the family of real topological toric manifolds with the
restricted action of the 2-torus group (S 0 )n is strictly larger than the family of small covers up to
equivariant homeomorphism. Therefore, it is reasonable to address the rigidity problems discussed
above for real topological toric manifolds.
5. STRONG COHOMOLOGICAL RIGIDITY PROBLEMS
The cohomological rigidity problem for toric manifolds is whether two toric manifolds are diffeomorphic or homeomorphic if their cohomology rings are isomorphic. More strongly, we may ask
the following [35].
Strong cohomological rigidity problem for toric manifolds. Let M and N be toric manifolds, and ϕ : H ∗ (N ; Z) → H ∗ (M ; Z) a ring isomorphism. Then, does there exist a diﬀeomorphism
or a homeomorphism f : M → N such that f ∗ = ϕ?
One can also address the problem for quasitoric manifolds or topological toric manifolds. In
general, the answer to this problem with diﬀeomorphism is “no.” In fact, Friedman and Morgan [22]
showed that some cohomology ring automorphism of CP2 #10CP2 is not induced by its diﬀeomorphism while it is a (projective) toric manifold. On the contrary, we have some partial aﬃrmative
solutions to the problem with diﬀeomorphism.
Theorem 5.1. The answer to the strong cohomological rigidity problem with diﬀeomorphism
is aﬃrmative in the following cases:
(1) either M or N is

m
ni
i=1 CP

(see [34] when ni = 1 for any i and [16] in general),

(2) both M and N are Q-trivial Bott manifolds [9],
(3) both M and N are three-stage Bott manifolds [4].

Note that Stiefel–Whitney classes are homotopy invariants, and Pontrjagin classes are homeomorphism invariants for closed smooth manifolds with torsion-free cohomology rings.
Proposition 5.2 [11]. Let M and M be connected closed manifolds of dimension n having isomorphic cohomology rings with Z/2-coeﬃcients. Suppose that H ∗ (M ; Z/2) is generated by
H r (M ; Z/2) for some r as a ring. Then any ring isomorphism between M and M preserves their
Stiefel–Whitney classes.
Recently, the ﬁrst author proved the following.
Theorem 5.3 [5]. Any graded ring isomorphism between the integral cohomology rings of
n-stage Bott manifolds preserves their Pontrjagin classes. In particular, there are only ﬁnitely
many diﬀeomorphism classes of Bott manifolds which are homotopy equivalent.
The strong cohomological rigidity problem can also be addressed for real toric manifolds, small
covers or real topological toric manifolds. We may consider the problem for those manifolds with
Z-coeﬃcients as above, but it would be practical to take Z/2-coeﬃcients as mentioned before. Since
the answer to the cohomological rigidity problem with Z/2-coeﬃcients is negative for generalized
real Bott manifolds as we stated before, the strong cohomological rigidity with Z/2-coeﬃcients fails
for them. However, it holds for real Bott manifolds.
Theorem 5.4 [10]. Any isomorphism between the cohomology rings of two real Bott manifolds
with Z/2-coeﬃcients is induced by a diﬀeomorphism.
6. RIGIDITY PROBLEMS FOR POLYTOPES
As mentioned before, a complete non-singular fan is associated with a toric manifold. One
of interesting questions is whether the cohomology ring of a toric manifold X determines the
combinatorial structure of the underlying simplicial complex ΣX of the fan associated with X.
Although H ∗ (X; Z) does not determine ΣX in general, it sometimes does; for instance, if H ∗ (X; Z)
is isomorphic to the cohomology ring of some Bott manifold, then ΣX is the boundary complex of
a crosspolytope [34]. This motivated the introduction of several notions of rigidity for simplicial
complexes or polytopes. Here are two of them.
(1) A simplicial complex K is (cohomologically) rigid if there is a toric manifold X with K = ΣX ,
and whenever there exists a toric manifold Y with a graded ring isomorphism H ∗ (X; Z) ∼
=
∗
H (Y ; Z), ΣY is isomorphic to K as a simplicial complex [35].
(2) A simple polytope P is cohomologically rigid if there exists a quasitoric manifold M over P ,
and whenever there exists a quasitoric manifold N over a simple polytope Q with a graded
ring isomorphism H ∗ (M ; Z) ∼
= H ∗ (N ; Z), Q is combinatorially equivalent to P [13]. A simplicial polytope is said to be cohomologically rigid if its dual simple polytope is cohomologically
rigid.
The above rigidity of simplicial complexes or polytopes requires the existence of supporting
toric manifolds or quasitoric manifolds. It raises some ambiguity. For instance, the dodecahedron
is cohomologically rigid in the sense of (2) above [13], but we do not know whether the boundary
complex of its dual polytope is rigid in the sense of (1) above because we do not know whether
it supports a toric manifold. Moreover, we may use topological toric manifolds instead of toric
manifolds or quasitoric manifolds to deﬁne the rigidity above. But then, this new notion of rigidity
might be diﬀerent from the rigidity in (1) or (2) above. Thus, we are led to deﬁne rigidity in a
purely algebraic and combinatorial way.
6.1. Combinatorial rigidity. Let k be a commutative ring with unity and A = k[v1 , . . . , vm ]
the polynomial graded ring in v1 , . . . , vm over k with deg vi = 2 for all i. Let K be a simplicial
complex with {1, . . . , m} as the set of vertices. The Stanley–Reisner ring k(K) of K over k is deﬁned

to be A/IK , where IK is the ideal generated by the monomials vi1 vi2 . . . vir such that {i1 , i2 , . . . , ir }
does not support a face of K.
It is known that the simplicial complex ΣX associated with a toric manifold X is Cohen–
Macaulay, and there exists a linear system of parameters in Z(ΣX ). As mentioned before, H ∗ (X; Z)
is the face ring Z(ΣX ) modulo some linear system of parameters.
Deﬁnition 6.1. Let K be a set of Cohen–Macaulay complexes. An element K of K is cohomologically rigid in K if K ∈ K is isomorphic to K whenever Z(K )/J is isomorphic to Z(K)/J
as graded rings where J and J are the ideals generated by linear systems of parameters in Z(K )
and Z(K), respectively.
Let KCM be the set of Cohen–Macaulay complexes, KT the set of simplicial complexes supporting
toric manifolds, and Kpoly the set of the boundary complexes of simplicial polytopes. We remark
that both KT and Kpoly are subsets of KCM .
Problem 6.2. Find all simplicial complexes which are cohomologically rigid in KCM , KT
or Kpoly .
On the other hand, the cohomological rigidity of polytopes can be considered as a purely combinatorial problem. Let K be a Cohen–Macaulay complex. A ﬁnite free resolution [F : φ] of Q(K)
is an exact sequence
φr

φr−1

0 → Fr −→ Fr−1 −−−→ . . . −→ F1 −→ F0 −→ Q(K) → 0,

(6.1)

where Fi is a ﬁnite free Q[x1 , . . . , xn ]-module and each φi is degree-preserving. If we take Fi to
be the module generated by the minimal basis of Ker(φi−1 ), then we get a minimal resolution of
Q(K). Since Q(K) is graded, so are all Fi ’s; that is, Fi = j Fi,2j . We denote
βi,2j (K) = dimQ Fi,2j
and call it the (i, 2j)th bigraded Betti number of K. Choi, Panov and Suh [13] showed that Z(K)/J ∼
=
Z(K )/J implies that βi,j (K) = βi,j (K ) for all i and j, where K ∈ KCM , and J ⊂ Z(K) and
J ⊂ Z(K ) are ideals generated by linear systems of parameters. This theorem raises the following
new notion of rigidity for simplicial complexes.
Deﬁnition 6.3. Let K be a subset of Cohen–Macaulay complexes. An element K of K is
combinatorially rigid in K if K ∈ K is isomorphic to K whenever βi,j (K ) = βi,j (K) for all i and j.
The term “combinatorial rigidity” was introduced by the ﬁrst author and J.S. Kim [7]. Note
that if K is combinatorially rigid in K, then K is cohomologically rigid in K.
Problem 6.4. Find all simplicial complexes which are combinatorially rigid in KCM , KT
or Kpoly .
We note that the bigraded Betti numbers can be computed in a combinatorial way [25]. Hence,
Problem 6.4 is a purely combinatorial problem. From now on, we consider only the combinatorial
rigidity in Kpoly . We sometimes do not distinguish between a simplicial polytope and its boundary
complex.
6.2. Irreducible rigid polytopes. Let K1 and K2 be simplicial polytopes. A connected
sum of K1 and K2 is a polytope obtained by attaching a facet of K1 and a facet of K2 . It depends
on the way of choosing the two facets and identifying their vertices. A simplicial polytope K is
called reducible if it can be expressed as a connected sum of two polytopes, and is called irreducible
otherwise. Let C(K1 K2 ) denote the set of connected sums of K1 and K2 . If there is only one
connected sum of K1 and K2 up to isomorphism, then we will write the unique polytope as K1 K2 .

Example 6.5. The polytopes in Table 2 are both irreducible and combinatorially rigid in Kpoly .
For reader’s convenience, we represent the polytopes in terms of both simple and simplicial terminologies. Furthermore, the duals of triangle-free n-dimensional simple polytopes with at most 2n+2
facets, and the duals of all irreducible three-dimensional simple polytopes with at most nine facets
are both irreducible and combinatorially rigid [13].
On the other hand, not all irreducible polytopes are combinatorially rigid. It is known that
there are 10 irreducible three-dimensional simple polytopes with 10 facets. Among them, the duals
of the two polytopes in Fig. 1 have the identical bigraded Betti numbers [17]. So they are not combinatorially rigid in Kpoly . However, we do not know whether they are cohomologically rigid or not.
Problem 6.6. Find a polytope which is rigid cohomologically but not combinatorially in Kpoly .
6.3. Reducible rigid polytopes. We have many examples of reducible non-rigid simplicial
polytopes. A stacked polytope is a simplicial polytope obtained by a sequence of connected sums
of simplices from a simplex. The bigraded Betti numbers of a stacked polytope only depend on
the number of simplices [6, 39]. One can easily see that there are at least two elements in the
set of connected sums of k copies of n-simplices, where n ≥ 3 and k ≥ 4. Hence, they provide a
lot of simplicial polytopes that are combinatorially (even cohomologically, see [35]) non-rigid but
reducible.
In many cases, the bigraded Betti numbers of the connected sum of simplicial polytopes (such
as simplices and two- and three-polytopes) are independent of the ways of making the connected

sum. In these cases, the rigidity of a reducible polytope K ∈ C(K1 K2 ) is closely related to the
singleton-ness of C(K1 K2 ). Roughly speaking, reducible simplicial polytopes are combinatorially
non-rigid unless both K1 and K2 admit suﬃcient symmetry. In the two-dimensional case, a k-gon
can be represented by the connected sum of k − 2 triangles, and is combinatorially rigid. However,
in higher dimension, there might be only a few examples which are both combinatorially rigid and
reducible.
The ﬁrst author and J.S. Kim [7] studied the rigidity of reducible polytopes of dimension 3. They
established a necessary condition for C(K1 K2 ) to be a singleton, and found some reducible rigid
polytopes of dimension 3. Let T4 , C8 , O6 , D20 and I12 be the ﬁve Platonic solids: the tetrahedron,
the cube, the octahedron, the dodecahedron and the icosahedron, respectively. We also let ξ1 (C8 ),
ξ2 (C8 ), ξ1 (D20 ) and ξ2 (D20 ) be the polytopes shown in Fig. 2, and Bn the bipyramid with n vertices.
Theorem 6.7 [7]. Let P be a three-dimensional simplicial polytope. If P is reducible and
combinatorially rigid, then P is either T4 #T4 #T4 or P1 #P2 , where
P1 ∈ {T4 , O6 , I12 },

P2 ∈ {T4 , O6 , I12 , ξ1 (C8 ), ξ2 (C8 ), ξ1 (D20 ), ξ2 (D20 )} ∪ {Bn : n ≥ 7}.

In addition, the following are combinatorially rigid in Kpoly :
