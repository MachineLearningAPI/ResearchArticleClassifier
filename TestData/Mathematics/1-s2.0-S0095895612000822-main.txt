The cop-number of a graph is the minimum number of cops
needed to catch a robber on the graph, where the cops and the
robber alternate moving from a vertex to a neighbouring vertex.
√
It is conjectured by Meyniel that for a graph on n vertices O ( n )
cops suﬃce. The aim of this paper is to investigate the cop-number
of a random graph. We prove that for sparse random graphs the
cop-number has order of magnitude n1/2+o(1) .
The best known strategy for general graphs is the area-defending
strategy, where each cop ‘controls’ one region by himself. We show
that, for general graphs, this strategy cannot be too effective: there
are graphs that need at least n1−o(1) cops for this strategy.

1. Introduction
We will study the following pursuit and evasion game, usually known as cops and robbers. There
is a ﬁnite, connected, undirected graph G, and m cops and one robber. At the start, each cop chooses
one vertex, and then the robber makes his choice of a vertex. Then they move alternately (ﬁrst the
cops and then the robber). In the cops’ turn, each cop may move to an adjacent vertex, or remain
where he is, and similarly for the robber. The cops win the game if one of the cops catches the robber,
i.e. lands on the same vertex. We denote by c (G ) the ‘cop-number’ of G, meaning the minimal m such
that m cops have a winning strategy in G, and by c (n) the maximum of c (G ) over all graphs with n
vertices.
This game has been studied by several authors. Maamoun and Meyniel determined the copnumber for grids [9]. Aigner and Fromme [1] proved that in the case of planar graphs three cops

can catch the robber. Andreae [2] showed that, for graphs without a complete K k minor, 2 cops
suﬃce. Quilliot [14] found the upper bound c (G ) 2k + 3 for graphs with orientable genus at most k.
Frankl [5] gave lower bounds on c (G ) in the case of graphs of large girth. The graphs with c (G ) = 1
were characterized by Nowakowski and Winkler [10] and Quilliot [13] independently – such characterizations have complexity theoretical motivations: see Goldstein and Reingold [6]. (Brightwell and
Winkler [3] characterized graphs with cop-number one in the ‘active’ game: they do not allow the
robber or the cops to stay at their vertex unless there is a loop at that vertex.)
We mention in passing that a similar game was considered by Parsons [11,12], in a continuous
setting, but that version is rather different in that the cops there do not have any information about
the robber’s moves.
Clearly the most substantial
√ question is to√determine the order of magnitude of c (n). Meyniel
conjectured that c (n) = O ( n ). To see why n cops can be needed, note that if a graph G has
no cycle of length shorter than ﬁve and every vertex has degree at least δ then c (G ) δ : if it is the
robber’s turn to move then he has a choice not adjacent to any cop vertex,
since each cop has at most
√
one common neighbour with the robber. In particular we will get n as the order of magnitude of
c (G ) for the incidence graph of a ﬁnite geometry, that is, the bipartite graph with vertex set consisting
of the points and lines of the geometry, and with two vertices representing a point and a line being
adjacent if the point is on the line. Indeed, if the geometry has q2 + q + 1 points then the bipartite
graph will have 2q2 + 2q + 2 points. And at least q + 1 cops will be needed: at every step the robber
will have q + 1 neighbours and a cop vertex will be adjacent to at most one of these, since the graph
contains no triangle and cycle of length 4 (so the robber will always have an escape choice if the
number of cops is at most q).
In Section 2 we generalize the robber’s strategy for graphs of large girth. We also give a new
strategy for the cops. This will be needed for later, and may be of independent interest.
Our main aim in this paper is to prove that Meyniel’s conjecture essentially holds for sparse random graphs: the cop-number has order of magnitude Ω(n1/2+o(1) ) in this case. In fact, our upper
bound holds also for denser random graphs, whereas the lower bound does depend on the density.
This is the content of Section 3. We have recently learnt that Łuczak and Prałat have determined the
logarithmic order of magnitude of the cop-number for denser random graphs (when pn = nα +o(1) for
α > 0) – see [8].
The best upper bound known on c (n) is O ( logn n ) – see [4]. This comes from the simple facts that
the neighbourhood of a vertex and also the shortest path between two points can be defended by a
single cop. In Section 4, we analyze the question of how eﬃcient such an area-defending strategy can
be (with each single cop defending an area independently). It turns out that the area defended by a
single cop will be a retract, meaning the image of the graph under a homomorphism that ﬁxes its
image (here by ‘homomorphism’ we mean a mapping of the vertices that sends each edge to an edge
or a single vertex).
Our aim in Section 4 is to prove that such strategy cannot be too effective: we construct a graph G
whose largest retract (apart from G itself) has size only a log-power.
Finally, in Section 5 we pose a few open questions.

2.1. The robber’s strategy
First we give a lower bound on the cop-number. The “baby version” of this strategy for the robber
was used in large girth graphs by Frankl [5]. We will assign a weight to every position: this will be
some weighted sum of the number of non-backtracking walks of different length from the robber to
the cop. The robber will always choose the next step to minimize this function. The robber will move
on an induced subgraph R of G with minimal degree δ( R ) large enough. Set M i (s) = M i (G , R , s) =
maxx∈ V ( R ), S ⊆ V (G ),| S |=s number of non-backtracking walks of length 2i from S to x.
Theorem 2. Let G be a connected graph on n vertices, R an induced subgraph with minimal degree δ( R ) =
d 3. Then for every positive integer r the inequality (d − 1)−r M r (2c (G )) e(r1+1) holds for the cop-number
c ( G ).
Proof. We will consider the game with ‘active’ cops: this means that a cop is not allowed to stay at
his vertex (unless there is a loop at that vertex), and that the cops only will win if a cop and the
robber are at the same vertex after the cops’ turn (so the robber cannot commit suicide by moving to a
cop’s vertex). Note that 2c (G ) cops can win the active game. Indeed, the cops go in pairs: one follows
the original strategy and the other always goes to a neighbour vertex, unless the ﬁrst cop has to stay
according to the original strategy, in which case they swap vertices and swap roles. So it suﬃces to
prove that 2c active cops cannot catch the robber if there exists an r such that (d − 1)−r M r (2c ) <
1
holds.
e (r +1)
Let N i (depending on the cops’ and the robber’s position) denote the number of non-backtracking
walks of length 2i from the robber to a cop such that the ﬁrst edge of this walk is not the one the
M i (2c ). We will show that the robber has a strategy to keep the
robber used last time. Clearly N i
following function less than one:
r

W =

−i + r log(id−1)

(d − 1)

Ni .

i =0

Note that if the robber manages this then he will win, since N 0 1 when the robber is caught. The
robber will also always move and his walk will be non-backtracking. His strategy will be always to
minimize W . So assume W < 1 and that it is the robber’s turn. Now according to the robber’s choice
d−2
of the walks in W is removed from the sum. The cops now make their step: in the
a fraction
d−1
worst case all get closer to the robber, or, to put it another way, they make the last step of all the
walks not neglected by the robber. Now, a walk of length 2i from the robber to a cop corresponds to a
walk of length 2(i + 1) in the previous position. But we have to be careful with possible backtracking
walks in the old position giving non-backtracking walks in the new position. This can only arise as
follows: a cop moves from the vertex x to y and so a new non-backtracking walk y starting with the
edges ( yx), (xz) for some vertex z contributes to the new sum. But every such walk corresponds to
an (even shorter) subwalk from y we counted in the sum but it does not appear, since the cop went
in the other way. A similar thing cannot happen on the robber’s side: assume that the robber moved
from x to y. Now we may have a walk starting with ( yx) which comes from a backtracking walk. But
this walk will not contribute to the sum since its ﬁrst edge is just the one used by the robber last
time.
− r log(1d−1)

The contribution of these inherited walks to the new weight W new is at most (d − 1)
times smaller than W : the walk will be shorter by two, but its weight is (d − 1)
Altogether these give at most W e

. And we have the last summand as well: by our assumption this
−1

−1

is at most e(r +1) < 1 − e . This yields W new (1 − e r ) + e r W . Hence if W < 1 then W new < 1.
Finally we have to ﬁnd an appropriate initial position with W < 1.
Given the initial position of the (active) cops, let us choose the initial position of the robber randomly (according to the uniform distribution on V ( R )); we shall show that the expected value of
W is less than 1. Let E i denote the expected number of non-backtracking walks connecting a vertex
M i (2c ). Note that E i +1 (d − 1)2 E i : the number
x ∈ V ( R ) to a set S ⊆ V (G ) of size 2c. Clearly E i

of non-backtracking walks of length 2(i + 1) starting at a vertex in R is at least the number of nonbacktracking walks of length 2(i + 1) starting at a vertex in R with the ﬁrst two steps in R. And this
is at least (d − 1)2 times the number of walks of length 2i from R, since δ( R ) = d. Now the expected
value of W is

This completes the proof of the theorem.

2.2. The cops’ strategy
Our aim is to place the cops on some ‘spread-out’ set of vertices, and the hope is then that,
wherever the robber may be, our cops are dense enough near a ball around the robber that they can
move in and seal him off. This ‘dense enough’ will be accomplished by a Hall type of argument.
For x ∈ V (G ) and a positive integer r we denote by B (x, r ) the ball of radius r around x: the set of
vertices at distance at most r from x. For a set of vertices S, let N ( S , r ) denote the r-neighbourhood
of S, that is, the set of vertices at distance at most r from S.
Lemma 3. Let G be a connected graph on n vertices, and let I ⊆ V (G ). If for every x ∈ V (G ) there exists r = r x
such that for every S ⊆ B (x, r ) the inequality | I ∩ N ( S , r + 1)| | S | holds, then | I | c (G ).
Proof. We give a winning strategy with | I | cops. The cops’ initial position is the set I . Let x denote
the robber’s vertex and r the corresponding radius (as given in the statement of the lemma). By the
˝
Konig–Hall
theorem we can assign to every y ∈ B (x, r ) a cop in B ( y , r + 1) such that we assign to
every vertex y a different cop. So let each cop initially, in the ﬁrst (r + 1) steps, go to his vertex and
stay there. Since the robber cannot leave B (x, r ) in r steps he will be caught. ✷
Corollary 4. Let G be a connected graph on n vertices and c an integer. If there exists an integer r such that for
every x ∈ V (G ), S ⊆ B (x, r ) the inequality 10| S | log (n) nc | N ( S , r + 1)| holds, then c c (G ).
Proof. The case n 3 is trivial, so we assume n 4. We will choose a random initial position I for the
cops and show that the conditions of the previous lemma will hold with positive probability. For every
c
and these events will be independent. The probability
x ∈ V (G ) the probability that x ∈ I will be 2n
that | I | > c is less than 1/2 by the Markov inequality. Consider the vertex x ∈ V (G ) and the subset

Proof. We have seen that whp for every x ∈ V (G ) the ball B (x, r ) has size at most 2(npn+1) . Given
a set S the expected number of the edges with at least one endpoint in S is at most pn| S |.
Lemma 1 shows that the probability that the number of such edges differs by at least 3pn| S | log(n)
from its expected value is at most n−

large enough.
Now we prove that whp for every vertex x ∈ V (G ) the ball B (x, r ) consists of a tree plus at most
3
edges.
We may think about B (x, r ) as a set deﬁned in a process of r steps: We start with {x},
ε
then we add the neighbours of x, the new neighbours of this set etc. For every new vertex and new
edge from this point the probability that the other endpoint of this edge is an old point is at most
n1/2−ε

n−1/2−ε . Hence the probability to have at least 3/ε such edges is at most 3/ε (n−1/2−ε )3/ε < n− 2 .
Whp the number of such edges is at most 3/ε in every ball of radius r. After the removal of these
edges from the ball we get a tree. Every non-backtracking path in this ball is completely described by
its endpoints and the used edges (with direction) not in the tree. Hence the number of such paths of
length k is at most (1 + 6/ε )k < ( ε7 )k . ✷
Lemma 7. With high probability the following holds for the random graph G (n, p ) if pn > 1: for every 0 <

ε < 13 , integer r <

non-backtracking paths of length

− 1 and for every pair of vertices x, y ∈ V (G ) the number of

2r from x to y is at most ( ε7 )3r .

Proof. We know by the previous lemma that whp for every z ∈ B (x, r ) the number of nonbacktracking paths of length k from x to z in B (x, r ) is at most ( ε7 )k , and the same holds for the
ball B ( y , r ) and a vertex z ∈ B ( y , r ). First we estimate the number of those paths x0 = x, . . . , xl = y,

B. Bollobás et al. / Journal of Combinatorial Theory, Series B 103 (2013) 226–236

231

where for the last vertex xk ∈
/ B ( y , r ) of the path xk , xk+1 ∈
/ B (x, k − 1) holds. We call such paths
special.
Our strategy will be to bound the number of special paths ﬁrst using the previous lemma. Then we
will correspond to every other path a special one, such that every special path can be corresponded
to only a small number of paths: This argument will conclude the proof.
Set S = V (G ) \ ( B (x, k − 1) ∪ B ( y , r )). Consider a permutation ν of S and the graph G ν with
the vertex set of G and edge set E (G ν ) = E (G ) ∪ {(a, b): a ∈ B ( y , r ) \ B (x, k − 1), b ∈ S , (a, ν (b)) ∈
E (G )} \ {(a, b): a ∈ B ( y , r ) \ B (x, k − 1), b ∈ S , (a, b) ∈ E (G )}. Note that the graphs G (n, p ) = G ν are
equiprobable. The edges from B ( y , r ) \ S (x, k − 1) to S (x, k) are the ones where these graphs G ν may
disagree. E.g. (xk , xk+1 ) is such an edge for a special path.
Now we examine the set of edges from the sphere S (x, k) to B ( y , r ) \ B (x, k − 1). We know
1

that whp B ( y , r ) and S (x, k) have at most n 2 −ε vertices and edges for every x, y ∈ V (G ). And
the distribution of the induced subgraph on the vertices V (G ) \ B ( y , r − 1) has the same distribution as G (n − | B ( y , r − 1)|, p ). The probability for an edge with one endpoint in S (x, k) that the

other endpoint is in B ( y , r ) will be at most

Now we estimate the total number of paths from x to y. Consider a path x0 = x, . . . , xl = y such
that l 2r, and the ﬁrst point in B ( y , r ), xk+1 is in B (x, k − 1). Let a0 = x, . . . , a j = xk+1 a shortest path from x to xk+1 and consider the path y 0 = a0 = x, y 1 = a1 , . . . , y j = a j = xk+1 , y j +1 =
xk+2 , . . . , yl− j +k−1 = xl = y. Note that this path is special. Every such special path can be corresponded to at most ( ε7 )k+1 paths, since this is an upper bound for the number of paths from x to xk+1
r
with length (k + 1). Since k + 1 r the number of such paths is at most r ( ε7 )2r k=0 ( ε7 )k+1 < 2r ( ε7 )3r .
Now consider a path such that xk+1 ∈
/ B (x, k − 1) but xk ∈ B (x, k − 1). To such a path we can
correspond again a special one by replacing the subpath x = x0 , . . . , xk by a shortest path from x to xk
(with length (k − 1)). We correspond every special path to at most ( ε7 )k paths. By the same argument
as above we get that the number of such paths is at most 2r ( ε7 )3r −1 .
Finally, in the case y ∈ B (x, r ) there are paths from x to y completely inside B ( y , r ). The number
2r
7 l

of these paths is at most
l=0 ( ε ) < 2( ε ) . Altogether, summing up the number of four types of
path we get that whp for every x, y ∈ V (G ) there are at most r ( ε7 )3r non-backtracking paths with
length at most 2r from x to y. ✷

Now we will prove an upper bound on the cop-number. We will estimate the vertex expansion in
random graphs in order to use Corollary 4.
Theorem 9. Let 0 < ε < 1. With high probability the following upper bound holds for the cop-number of the
random graph G = G (n, p ) if p > 2(1 + ε ) log (n)/n:

c G (n, p ) <

Proof. Set r = [ 2 log( pn) ]. In order to use Corollary 4 we suﬃce to show that with high probability the
following conditions hold:

• ∀x ∈ V (G ), | B (x, r )|
• ∀ S ⊆ V ( G ), | S |

Consider an arbitrary subset S ⊂ V (G ). The expected size of the vertex neighbourhood | N ( S )|
is | S | + (n − | S |)(1 − (1 − p )| S | ). This is less than ( pn + 1)| S |. On the other hand it is at least
2+ε

n(1 − e − p | S | ). Given a subset S ⊆ V (G ) Lemma 1 implies that with probability at least 1 − n− 2 | S |
the neighbourhood | N ( S )| differs from its expected value by at most 2 log(n)(1 + ε /2)( pn + 1)| S |

First we will prove for every integer k r and every x ∈ V (G ) the inequality | B (x, k)| 4( pn + 2)k .

Now we prove the second condition. For every | T | > ( pn + 1)2 the size of the neighbourhood
N ( T ) will differ by at most | T | from the expected value: | N ( T )| > (1 − e − p | T | )(n − | T |) + | T | − | T | =
(1 − e − p | T | )(n − | T |). If | T | p (log(1n)+1) holds, too, then | N ( T )| > (1 − log1(n) ) pn| T |.

In the last case | T | > p (log(1n)+1) it is enough to have the rough bound | N ( T )| > max{ n3 ,

4. Defending an area
In this section we analyze the area-defending strategy. By this strategy we mean that each cop
defends an area by himself, where ‘defends an area’ means ‘moves around in that area in such a way
that, if the robber ever enters the area, he is instantly caught by the cop’. A moment’s thought shows
that the area-defending strategy of a cop is a retraction r : G → G, that is, a homomorphism (i.e. the
image of an edge is an edge) of the reﬂexive graph (i.e. we have a loop at every vertex) G, which ﬁxes
its image: r ◦ r = r. When the robber is at the vertex x ∈ G then the cop goes to r (x). The existence
of a retraction is a necessary condition for a cop to defend an area in this sense. We do not need a
suﬃcient condition in this section.
We prove that this strategy cannot be too effective: in some graphs the largest area that can be
defended by one cop (equivalently, the largest image of a non-identity retract) is at most a power of
log.
Theorem 10. For every positive integer n there is a graph on n vertices with largest proper retract of size
O (log(n)8 ).
Proof. First we choose three positive integers d, s, l: the choice will depend on n. These will satisfy
the conditions l > s + 8 and 2ds > (2d − 1)(l + 2). We specify the other conditions on d, s and l at the
end of the proof: the precise values are important only to ensure that we obtain a graph on exactly n
vertices.
Consider the d-dimensional hypercube Q . We subdivide every edge of Q by adding either s,
(s + 1), (s + 2) or l, (l + 1) or (l + 2) vertices. We call the edges of Q divided by s, (s + 1) or (s + 2)
vertices ‘short’ and the other edges ‘long’. We decide for every edge independently and randomly if
the edge is short or long (each with probability one half). This random choice gives us many graphs,
because every long edge may have (l + 1), (l + 2) or (l + 3) edges and every short one (s + 1), (s + 2)
or (s + 3). We will prove that with high probability none of these graphs will have a large proper
retract. And ﬁnally we will choose the lengths of the edges to have a graph on exactly n vertices.
We denote the resulting graph by G. We call a subgraph S of G reduced if for every x ∈ V ( S )
either x ∈ V ( Q ) or the complete path corresponding to the edge of Q containing x is in S. We
further require that if S contains the endpoints of an edge of Q then the corresponding path is
in S. So a reduced graph S is determined by S ∩ Q . We denote the following subgraph of Q by S :
V ( S ) = V ( S ) ∩ V ( Q ) and x, y ∈ V ( Q ) are adjacent in S if they are adjacent in Q and S contains
|R|
the path in G connecting them. Every retract R gives rise to a reduced retract of size [ d(l+2) ]: R is

234

B. Bollobás et al. / Journal of Combinatorial Theory, Series B 103 (2013) 226–236

connected and so every “bad” vertex of R is on an edge of Q , and can be mapped to the endpoint
which is in R.
We will show that with positive probability all reduced retracts of G are of size O (ld5 ). First we
show that the number of the corresponding sets R is small. Consider the vertices of Q as 0 − 1
vectors of length d, with the ith coordinate of x ∈ V ( Q ) denoted by xi . We say that the subset
S ⊆ V ( Q ) is a union of quarters if for all x ∈ V ( S ) there are two coordinates 1 i < j d such that if
for a vertex y ∈ V ( Q ) we have xi = y i and x j = y j then y ∈ V ( S ). The number of such subsets of Q
2
is clearly at most 22d −2d .

Claim. Let r : G → G be a retraction such that R = r (G ) is a reduced retract of G. Then V ( Q ) \ V ( R ) is a
union of quarters.
First assume that there is a z ∈ V ( Q ) ∩ V ( R ) adjacent to x ∈ V ( Q ) \ V ( R ). We have dist G (x, z)
dist G (r (x), z). Let v denote the closest vertex to r (x) in Q . We know that either v = z or else v
is adjacent to z, in which case let j denote the coordinate where they differ. (If v = z then any
coordinate will suﬃce as j.) The vertices x and z differ in coordinate i, where j = i. We will show
/R.
that if y ∈ Q agrees with x in coordinates i, j then y ∈
Suppose for a contradiction that y = r ( y ). We will use that dist Q ( v , y ) dist Q (x, y ) + 1 and the
triangle inequality:

dist G r ( y ), r (x) = dist G y , r (x)

dist G ( y , v ) −

dist Q ( y , v )(s + 1) −

l+3

l+3

> dist Q ( y , x)(l + 3)

dist G ( y , x).

This contradicts the contractive property of the retraction r.
If x is not adjacent (in Q ) to any vertex in R then consider a shortest path (in Q ) from x to R .
Let z denote its endpoint and x ∈ Q the vertex of the path adjacent to z (in Q ). Now we know that
x is contained by an appropriate “quarter”: if x and z differ in coordinate i and r (x ) is at distance
at most one from the edge corresponding to coordinate j this quarter will correspond to coordinates
i, j. The vertex x has to agree with x in these coordinates, as otherwise there would be a shorter
path from x to R in Q and so in G. So V ( Q ) \ V ( R ) is a union of quarters.
Now we will show that with high probability G has no large proper reduced retract. We will show
that for every large induced subgraph R whose complement is a union of quarters the probability
that the (unique) reduced subgraph R which R corresponds to is a retract of G is small. We will use
the following two observations.
(1) Let x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 be a 4-cycle in Q . If a reduced retract of G contains x2 , x3 , x4 but not x1 then
at least one of the edges (x1 , x2 ), (x1 , x4 ) is long or one of the edges (x2 , x3 ), (x3 , x4 ) is short.
(2) Let x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 , y 1 , y 2 , y 3 , y 4 ∈ Q be a (3-dimensional) subcube of Q , where both x1 , x2 , x3 , x4
and y 1 , y 2 , y 3 , y 4 are 4-cycles. If a reduced retract contains x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 but not y 1 , y 2 , y 3 , y 4
then at least one of the edges (x1 , x2 ), (x2 , x3 ), (x3 , x4 ), (x4 , x1 ) is short or at least one of the
edges (x1 , y 1 ), (x2 , y 2 ), (x3 , y 3 ), (x4 , y 4 ), ( y 1 , y 2 ), ( y 2 , y 3 ), ( y 3 , y 4 ), ( y 4 , y 1 ) is long.

The probability of the ﬁrst event is 1 − 16
, while the probability of the second is 1 − 4096
. The
proofs need some case analysis: we leave this to the reader.
We will show that for every adjacent pair (a, b) (in Q ), where a ∈ R , b ∈ Q \ R , either there
are four vertices y 1 ∈ Q \ R , y 2 , y 3 , y 4 ∈ Q ∩ R at distance at most 3 from b forming the ﬁrst
conﬁguration or there are eight vertices at distance at most 3 forming the second conﬁguration.
We may assume without loss of generality that a and b differ in their ﬁrst coordinate.
First suppose that a has two neighbours in Q ∩ R , say x2 and x3 . If the other neighbour of x2
and x3 , denoted by x4 , is not in Q ∩ R then these four points form a conﬁguration of the ﬁrst type. If
x4 ∈ Q ∩ R then we check their neighbours (in the direction of the ﬁrst coordinate): if none of these
is in R then we have a conﬁguration of the second type. Otherwise, since we know that at least one
of these vertices, namely b, is not in R , we obtain four points in a conﬁguration of the ﬁrst type.

On the other hand, if a has less than two neighbours in Q ∩ R and | Q ∩ R | 3 then the neighbour of a, namely b, should have another neighbour, say c, in Q ∩ R . Now there is an element d
s.t. {a, b, c , d} is a square. These four points form a conﬁguration of the ﬁrst type, since d = b is a

neighbour of a, and so d ∈
We know that the number of induced subgraphs of S ⊆ Q such that V ( Q ) \ V ( S ) is a union of

quarters is at most 22d −2d . We will show that for every such potential R large enough there are
many such disjoint conﬁgurations. We know by Harper’s theorem [7] that the edge boundary of a
subset of the hypercube is at least the size of the subset (if the subset has size at most half of
the hypercube). The complement of S has size at least 14 | Q | unless S = Q , since it is a union of
quarters. The boundary has at least min{| S |, | Q |/4} vertices. Let us ﬁnd a bad conﬁguration in Q ,
then a new bad conﬁguration not covered by the 3-neighbourhood of this conﬁguration, and so on.

Now we specify our other conditions on s, l and d. We need that |d2d−1 s+2l+2 − n| + 2(l − s) ×

the difference between the number of long and short edges is

by the Chebyshev inequality at most 2(l − s) 2d2d−1 . The left hand side is an upper bound on the
difference between n and the number of vertices in G (assuming that short edges have s + 2 edges
and long edges have l + 2 edges all).
The right hand side is the number of edges in Q : at every edge we can add or remove a vertex
to have exactly n vertices. The conditions are: l > s + 8, 2ds > (2d − 1)(l + 2) and |d2d−1 s+2l+2 − n| +

√

2(l − s) 2d2d−1 < d2d−l . Let us choose d such that d2d−1 100d n (d + 1)2d 100(d + 1), and let
s + l + 2 be the closest integer to nd and l = s + 9 or l = s + 10. This choice will satisfy the conditions
d2
if n (and so d) is large enough. ✷

There are many nice topological techniques to show that there is no homomorphism from one
graph to another. We would be glad to see some interesting, say topological, example. The graph
constructed in the proof is quite close to a product, so that similar strategies to those that have
worked here will work in product graphs (or particularly grids).
5. Open questions
We start by repeating what must be the main open question:
Question 1. What is the order of magnitude of the function c (n)?

√

Recall that Meyniel conjectured c (n) = O ( n ). The best upper bound on c (n) is that of Frankl [5],
n log log n
namely (1 + o(1)) log n . Thus even an upper bound of n1−ε for any ﬁxed ε > 0 would be very
signiﬁcant progress.
Our next question concerns forbidden minors.
Question 2. Amongst all graphs G not containing a K k minor how large can c (G ) be?
k−1

As stated earlier Andreae [2] showed that c (G )
in this case. Note that an upper bound that
2
is less than quadratic in k would be of great interest, because if c (G ) = O (k2−ε ) then it follows that
ε . Indeed, if G has a vertex with degree Ω(nδ ) then one cop can defend
c (n) = O (n1−δ ), where δ = 4−
ε
the neighbourhood of this vertex, so we proceed by induction. Else G has O (n1+δ ) edges, hence the
largest complete minor has at most O (n1/2+δ/2 ) vertices. Now O (n(2−ε)(1/2+δ/2) ) = O (n1−δ ) cops will
suﬃce by our hypothesis.
Finally, for graphs on surfaces, Quilliot [14] gave bounds of c (G ) 2k + 3 for a graph with orientable genus at most k. It would be interesting to know what the true answer is.
