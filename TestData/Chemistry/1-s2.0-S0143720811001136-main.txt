A colorimetric chemosensor TBS-NA, 4-(tert-butyldimethylsilyloxy)-N-butyl-naphthalimide was designed
and synthesized. Addition of ﬂuoride ion to a CH3CN solution of TBS-NA can result in an obvious color
change (from colorless to yellow) and UVeVis absorption spectral change in a short time. This indicated
À
that TBS-NA had highly selectivity for ﬂuoride detection over other anions, such as ClÀ, BrÀ, IÀ, HSOÀ
4 , ClO4
À
and AcO in CH3CN solutions, and the selectively detection was due to the selective cleavage of SieO bond
in TBS-NA by ﬂuoride. The detection limit was calculated to be 0.59 mM.

1. Introduction
Anions play an important role in numerous kinds of chemical
and biological processes, and in recent years the design and
development of synthetic receptors and sensors for the detection of
anions have received considerable attention [1e11]. Among the
anions, ﬂuoride ion is one of the most important anions because of
its role in prevention of dental caries and the treatment of osteoporosis [12e15]. However excess intake ﬂuoride can cause many
serious disease such as gastric and kidney disorders, skeletal ﬂuorosis [16,17]. Thus, the development chemosensor for ﬂuoride
anion is of great importance for environment and human health
care. Recently, considerable efforts have been devoted to ﬂuoride
ion sensing via UVeVis, ﬂuorescence, or other methods [18e22].
Colorimetric sensor is more attractive for naked-eye detection
through a vivid color change.
The construction of a chemosensor may couple at least two units,
the binding site and the signaling subunit, which may be covalently
or non-covalently linked. Commonly, most binding site for sensing
ﬂuoride is NeH fragment, such as urea, thiourea, amide and pyrrole,
which can react with ﬂuoride through the formation of a hydrogen
bond. However, oxygen-containing anions may be possible interferents [23] during the ﬂuoride sensing. In 2003, Kim and Swager
develop a new method for ﬂuoride determination which can avoid

the interference [24]. In their report, tert-Butyldimethylsilyl (TBS)
ethers were chosen as receptors, because SieO bond of the silyl ether
could be selectively cleaved by ﬂuoride ion. Based on this mechanism, Hong and coworkers [25] successfully demonstrated a SieO
band-based ﬂuoride receptor detecting ﬂuoride quantiﬁcationally.
Zhu et al. [26] synthesized a cyanine dye, 1-ethyl-4-(p-tert-bytyldimethylsilane ether styryl) quinolinnium iodide, and determined
ﬂuoride ion by colorimetric method. And more recently, Akkaya et al.
[27] reported two Bodipy derivatives with silyl-protected phenol,
which could selectively sense ﬂuoride via UV and ﬂuorescence
methods.
Though optical probes for ﬂuoride based on the ﬂuoride-iontriggered SieO bond cleavage mechanism have been reported,
some disadvantages can be cited about these probes, such as
low sensitivity, longer reaction time. Here we reported a 1,8naphthalimide derivative TBS-NA for ﬂuoride determination in this
paper. The sensor exhibits a high selectivity for ﬂuoride ion over
other anions with absorbance red-shift in CH3CN. The absorbance
of TBS-NA at 474 nm increased linearly with the concentration of
ﬂuoride from 10 to 100 mM, and the detection limit was calculated
to be 0.59 mM. 1,8-naphthalimide dye was chosen as a ﬂuorophore
due to its outstanding chemical, thermal and photochemical
stability as well as its ﬂuorescence quantum yield [28,29]. The
synthesis of TBS-NA started from 4-bromo-1,8-naphthalic anhydride 1, via N-alkylation, substitution and hydrolysis steps,
compound 4 was produced. Then tert-butyldimethyllchlorosilane
was coupled with compound 4 to afford the target sensor TBS-NA
in 79% yield, as shown in Scheme 1.

Scheme 2. Cleavage of SieO bond in TBS-NA by ﬂuoride ion.

TBS-NA was studied in CH3CN solution. In the absence of anions,
the maximum absorption wavelength of TBS-NA is at about
362 nm. As shown in Fig. 1, when 10 equiv of TBAF was added to the
solution of sensor TBS-NA (1 Â 10À4 mol/L), the peak at 362 nm
disappeared and the red-shift band at 474 nm was observed. In the
same conditions, no signiﬁcant changes happened when 10 equiv
of tetrabutylammonium chloride, bromide, iodide, perchlorate,
acetate, hydrogen sulfate were added. The results suggest that
sensor TBS-NA has a high selectivity for the ﬂuoride anion over
other common anions.
Fig. 2 displays the visual aspects of ﬂuoride ion recognition and
sensing. Each vial contains a 10À4 mol/L of TBS-NA in CH3CN. The
addition of one equivalent of ﬂuoride ions solution induced the
appearance of a bright yellow color (the last vial), the addition of
one equivalent of other anions did not induce any color change. This
may be due to the high afﬁnity of silicon toward ﬂuoride ion which
resulted in the cleavage of SieO bond [16], as shown in Scheme 2.
To conform the assumption, 1H NMR was carried out (Fig. 3). The
Ha, Hc and Hd proton shifted to upﬁeld part obviously with the
addition of ﬂuoride, which due to the weak electron-withdrawing
ability of phenolate anion.
The interaction of sensor TBS-NA with the ﬂuoride was investigated through UVeVis spectrophotometric titration by adding
standard solution of TBAF (Fig. 4). As the concentration of ﬂuoride
ion increased, the absorbance intensity decreased at 362 nm, and
a new band at 474 nm increased. The isobestic point at about
400 nm observed in both cases was attributed to the equilibrium
between two species (TBS-NA and NA) throughout the titration
process. Fig. 4 (inset) also shows that there was a good linearity
between the absorbance at 474 nm and concentrations of FÀ in the

range from 10 mM to 100 mM, indicating that sensor TBS-NA can
detect quantitatively relevant concentrations of FÀ. The linear
equation was found to be y ¼ 1.023 Â 104x À 0.0631 (R ¼ 0.9962),
where y is the absorbance at 474 nm measured at a given FÀ
concentration and x represents the concentration (10À4 mol/L) of FÀ
added. According to IUPAC, the detection limit was determined
from three times the standard deviation of the blank signal (3s) as
0.59 mM.
The effect of reaction time on the UVeVis absorption spectra of
the detecting system was studied. Adding 1 equiv of ﬂuoride to
CH3CN solution of TBS-NA, 2 min later the absorbance at 474 nm of
the system gets to maximum and does not change with more
reaction time. It means the SieO band of TBS-NA can be cleaved in
a short time in CH3CN system. 3 min was selected as the detection
time in this paper.
4. Conclusions
In conclusion, a novel naphthalimide derivative TBS-NA has been
synthesized by the couple reaction between tert-butyldimethyllchlorosilane and 4-hydroxy-N-butyl-1,8-naphthalimide. Addition of
ﬂuoride ion to a CH3CN solution of TBS-NA can result in an obvious
color change (from colorless to yellow) and UVeVis absorption redshift in a short time. The method was based on the selective cleavage
of SieO bond in TBS-NA by ﬂuoride leading to a red-shift of the
maximum wavelength. This makes the simple-to-use and naked-eye
detection of ﬂuoride ion possible.
