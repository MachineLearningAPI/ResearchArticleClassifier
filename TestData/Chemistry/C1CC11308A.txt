A simple but highly selective colorimetric and ratiometric
ﬂuorescent chemodosimeter was designed and synthesized to
detect ﬂuoride ions (FÀ) in aqueous solution and living cells by
virtue of the strong aﬃnity of FÀ toward silicon.
Fluoride as a useful additive is frequently found in toothpaste,
pharmaceutical agents, and even drinking water owing to
its important roles in preventing dental caries and in the
treatment of osteoporosis.1 However, excessive ingestion of
ﬂuoride has been proven to cause some diseases and cancers.2
For example, sodium ﬂuoride (NaF) can aﬀect a number of
essential cell signaling components and disturb normal cellular
metabolism at a higher concentration.3 Thus, the quantitative
detection of ﬂuoride is of growing importance in chemical and
biological systems.
Currently, considerable attention has been paid to ﬂuorescent indicators for the determination of ﬂuoride ions (FÀ) due
to their apparent advantages over other methods, such as high
sensitivity, operational simplicity, and bioimaging analysis
in vivo, even in single living cells.1b,4 Despite advances in the
development of new reagents, there are still some limitations
in the quantitative detection and bioimaging.5 First, most
ﬂuoroionophores can only be operated in organic solvents to
detect tetrabutylammonium ﬂuoride rather than inorganic
ﬂuoride salts. Second, most of the current ﬂuorescent indicators
respond to FÀ with the changes only in ﬂuorescence intensity,
which are prone to be disturbed in the quantitative detection by
many factors, such as instrumental eﬃciency, environmental
conditions, and probe distribution.6 Third, as far as we know,
only a ﬂuorescent reagent for the imaging of FÀ in living
matrices has been reported for such reagents must meet various
requirements including water solubility, cell permeability, nontoxicity, etc.2c But this ﬂuorescent reagent derived from

coumarin needs to be excited by UV light, which poses potential
drawbacks to the bioimaging. These above-mentioned diﬃculties
should be overcome when designing FÀ indicators for chemical
and biological applications.
During the preparation of our manuscript, two studies on
colorimetric and ratiometric ﬂuorescent indicators have been
reported.7 In both papers, the recognition properties of
indicators for FÀ were investigated in detail in organic
solvents. Although two indicators can work in the mixture
of water and organic solvents, twenty percent water content
greatly demolished their excellent performances owing to the
strong solvation of FÀ. So, they have potential diﬃculties in
the determination of FÀ in living matrices.
Herein, we address these challenges by designing an amphipathic ﬂuorescent chemodosimeter 1 (Scheme 1, 1) employing
an internal charge transfer (ICT) mechanism for the ratiometric determination of FÀ in buﬀered aqueous solution and
living systems. Previous studies have demonstrated that the
subtle equilibrium between hydrophilicity and lipophilicity
of indicators is favourable for both cell permeability and
intracellular ﬂuorescence imaging.8 So, in the design of a
chemodosimeter, we chose the hydrophilic benzothiazolium
hemicyanine dye as the ﬂuorophore because of its desirable
spectral performances, excellent ICT structure and nontoxicity,9 and a lipophilic tert-butyldiphenylsilyl (TBDPS)
moiety as the speciﬁc reaction site for FÀ.2c,5a,10 We expected
that the reaction of chemodosimeter 1 with FÀ would trigger
the cleavage of the Si–O bond and release the longer wavelength ﬂuorescence of compound 2. The reaction mechanism
of chemodosimeter 1 and FÀ is shown in Scheme 1.

Chemodosimeter 1 was easily synthesized in a satisfactory
yield from N-ethyl-2-methyl-benzothiazolium iodide and
4-(tert-butyldiphenylsilyloxy)benzaldehyde, which was prepared
from tert-butylchlorodiphenylsilane and 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde.
Detailed procedures and characterizations are described in ESI.w
In this communication, the determination of FÀ with chemodosimeter 1 was investigated in a mixture of ethanol and water
(3 : 7, v/v) solution containing phosphate buﬀered saline (PBS)
(20 mM, pH 7.4). Chemodosimeter 1 displays one major
absorption band centered at 407 nm (Fig. S1, ESIw). When
FÀ was gradually added to the solution of 1, the maximum
absorption peak showed a 110 nm red shift with an isosbestic
point at 442 nm and the colour of the solution turned from
slight yellow to orange (Fig. S1 and S2, ESIw). Therefore,
chemodosimeter 1 can serve as a ‘‘naked-eye’’ indicator for
FÀ. In the ﬂuorescence emission spectrum (Fig. 1), chemodosimeter 1 exhibits the maximum emission peak at 500 nm in
the absence of FÀ. Upon addition of diﬀerent concentrations
of FÀ, the maximum emission peak undergoes a red shift to
558 nm with an isoemission point at 539 nm. Additionally,
there was a good linearity between the ﬂuorescence intensity
ratio, R (F500/F558) and the concentrations of FÀ in the range
of 0.5 to 28 mM with a detection limit of 0.08 mM,11 which
allowed the determination of FÀ by a ratiometric ﬂuorescence

method. Obviously, chemodosimeter 1 is a very promising
indicator for the detection of FÀ in environmental and biological
science because ﬂuoride becomes toxic at a higher concentration
(0.1 mM for drinking water standard and more than 3 mM for
biological systems).2b,5a
We then evaluated the selectivity of chemodosimeter 1
toward FÀ under the same conditions. As expected, nearly
no ﬂuorescence intensity changes were observed in the
presence of CO32À, SO42À, SCNÀ, NO3À, N3À, ClÀ, BrÀ, IÀ,
cysteine (Cys), glutathione (GSH), bovine serum albumin
(BSA), and human serum albumin (HSA) (Fig. 2). Also, the
eﬀects of interference of the above-mentioned analytes on
monitoring FÀ were investigated (Fig. 2). These results
demonstrated that chemodosimeter 1 possesses high selectivity
toward FÀ when present with other anions and biorelevant
analytes.
To conﬁrm the mechanism of chemodosimeter 1 in sensing
FÀ, the reaction of 1 and FÀ was conducted under the same
conditions as described above. The reaction products were
subjected to electrospray ionization mass spectral analysis,
and the peak at m/z 282.09453 [M–I]+ corresponding to
compound 2 was clearly observed (Fig. S7, ESIw). Furthermore, when the pH of the reaction mixture was adjusted to 4
using increasing concentrations of hydrochloric acid, the
colour of solution gradually faded and the maximum absorption and ﬂuorescence emission peaks were blue-shifted to
412 nm and 512 nm, respectively (Fig. S8, ESIw). The result
showed that compound 2 existed mainly in the deprotonated
form in the above analytical system. Therefore, all these data
indicated that the reaction most likely undergoes the proposed
mechanism as shown in Scheme 1.
Next, to further demonstrate the ability of chemodosimeter
1 to image FÀ in living matrices, we carried out experiments in
live RAW 264.7 macrophage cells. The cells incubated with
chemodosimeter 1 (5 mM) for 5 min showed a clear intracellular ﬂuorescence (Fig. 3b and c). The result revealed that
chemodosimeter 1 can penetrate the cell membrane. And then,

v/v). (a) Fluorescence spectra of 1 in the presence of increasing
concentrations of FÀ (ﬁnal concentration: 0, 0.5, 2, 4, 6, 10, 13, 16,
20, 24, 28, 36, 40, 50, 60 mM); (b) ﬂuorescence intensity ratio
(F500/F558) of 1 versus increasing concentrations of FÀ (ﬁnal concentration:
0.5, 2, 4, 6, 10, 13, 16, 20, 24, 28 mM). Each spectrum was obtained after
FÀ addition at 25 1C for 50 min.

Fig. 2 Fluorescence responses of 1 (5 mM) toward various analytes in
PBS (20 mM, pH 7.4) solution (ethanol/water = 3 : 7, v/v). Light gray
bars represent the addition of a single analyte including 60 mM anions
(CO32À, SO42À, SCNÀ, NO3À, N3À, ClÀ, BrÀ, IÀ, FÀ), 300 mM Cys,
3 mM GSH, 1 mg mLÀ1 BSA, and 1 mg mLÀ1 HSA. Black bars
represent the subsequent addition of FÀ to the mixture. All data
represent the ﬂuorescence intensity ratio F558/F500. Each spectrum was
obtained after various analytes addition at 25 1C for 50 min.

humidiﬁed atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Scale bar = 20 mm.

3 mM sodium ﬂuoride was added to the above cells for
another 20 min (Fig. 3f and g). As expected, distinct changes
of ratio ﬂuorescence responses in living cells were observed
(Fig. 3d and h). The bright-ﬁeld images (Fig. 3a and e)
conﬁrmed that the cells are viable throughout the bioimaging
experiments. These results demonstrated that chemodosimeter
1 can be used for the ratiometric ﬂuorescence imaging of FÀ in
living cells. Moreover, to evaluate cytotoxicity of chemodosimeter 1, we performed 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assays in HeLa cells with 5 and
10 mM chemodosimeter 1 for 1 h, respectively. The result
clearly showed that chemodosimeter 1 was of low toxicity to
cultured cells under the experimental conditions at the concentration of 5 mM for 25 min (Fig. S5, ESIw).
In conclusion, we have presented the synthesis and properties of a new ICT-based ﬂuorescent chemodosimeter 1 for FÀ
with benzothiazolium hemicyanine dye as the ﬂuorophore.
The chemodosimeter exhibits high FÀ-selectivity over various
anions and biorelevant analytes, which is ascribed to the
strong aﬃnity of FÀ toward silicon. Additionally, the chemodosimeter can not only serve as a ‘‘naked-eye’’ probe for FÀ,
but also detect FÀ quantitatively by a ratiometric ﬂuorescence
method in buﬀered aqueous solution. Importantly, the amphipathic chemodosimeter was successfully applied to the ratiometric ﬂuorescence imaging of FÀ in living cells. We highlight
the simplicity of the design and synthesis, yet its combined
properties, such as high speciﬁcity, longer excitation and
emission wavelength, visual and ratiometric ﬂuorescence determination with suitable sensitivity, desirable response time
and bioimaging in living cells, and anticipate that this chemodosimeter would be of great beneﬁt to biomedical researchers
for investigating the eﬀects of sodium ﬂuoride in biological
systems.
