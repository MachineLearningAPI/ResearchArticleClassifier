ABSTRACT

A copper-mediated oxidative cross-coupling of aryl- and alkenylboronic acids with (trifluoromethyl)trimethylsilane (Me3SiCF3) under mild conditions
has been developed. This method allows a wide range of functional group tolerant trifluoromethylated arenes and alkenes to be easily prepared.
This oxidative trifluoromethylation has the potential to introduce trifluoromethyl groups into advanced, highly functionalized organic molecules.

A large number of biologically active pharmaceuticals and
agrochemicals contain trifluoromethylated aromatic groups,
as the incorporation of a CF3 group into aromatics often
enhances their chemical and metabolic stability, lipophilicity,
and binding selectivity.1 The Swarts reaction (chlorinefluorine exchange using reactive SbF5)2 and treatment of
benzoic acid derivatives with SF43 are the traditional methods
for the construction of aryl carbon-CF3 bonds; however, such
harsh reaction conditions are not compatible with a large
number of functional groups. The cross-couplings of aromatic
halides with CuCF3 generated in situ represent the most
popular protocols for the synthesis of trifluoromethylated
aromatics but are mainly limited to aryl iodides and activated
aryl bromides as substrates.4,5 The radical6 and electrophilic7
trifluoromethylation of arenes were also reported, but these
methods were only applied to the trifluoromethylation of

methoxy, or amino groups, and in some cases, mixtures of
regioisomers were observed. Recently, palladium-mediated
reactions for the introduction of trifluoromethyl groups onto
aromatic rings have been intensely sought.8,9 Among this
impressive research, the palladium-catalyzed trifluoromethylation of aryl chlorides developed by Buchwald’s group is

trifluoromethylation chemistry.8a The high reaction temperature (120-140 °C) and the unsuitability for substrates
bearing aldehydes or ketones are current challenges of this
method. Thus, the development of a method of mild reaction
conditions and wide substrate scope for the incorporation of
trifluoromethyl groups into aromatic rings remains a topic
of great current interest. Herein, we report the first coppermediated oxidative trifluoromethyaltion of aryl- and alkenylboronic acids with nucleophilic (trifluoromethyl)trimethylsilane (CF3SiMe3). Advantages of the reported trifluoromethylation include mild reaction conditions, high functional
group tolerance, and ready availability of boronic acids.
Arylboronic acid derivatives are compatible with a broad
range of common functional groups, commercially available
and stable to air and moisture.10 Thus, arylboronic acid
derivatives have been widely used in organic synthesis.
Among a wide range of coupling reactions employing
boronic acids as partners, one class with growing importance
is the copper-mediated oxidative coupling of boronic acids
and nucleophiles,11 first developed by Chan and Evans and
separately Evans in 1998.12 A wide range of heteroatom
nucleophiles, including amines, amides, nitrogen heterocycles, alcohols, and phenols, were used in the ChanEvans-Lam coupling reactions. However, to the best of our
knowledge, these protocols do not involve carbon (sp3)nucleophiles. It was noteworthy that the fluorination of
arylboronic acids was reported,13 but the trifluoromethylation
of arylboronic acids has not been described in the literature.
Very recently, we have successfully developed the first

example of a copper-mediated protocol for Csp-Csp3 aerobic
oxidative trifluoromethylation of terminal alkynes with
nucleophilic (trifluoromethyl)trimethylsilane (Me3SiCF3).14
This reaction provides a general, straighforward, and practically useful method to prepare trifluoromethylated acetylenes.
Inspired by this work, we envisioned that the oxidative crosscoupling of in situ generated CuCF3 with arylboronic acid
may be possible and would provide new type of trifluoromethylation protocols for preparation of aryl-CF3 (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1. Oxidative Trifluoromethylation of Arylboronic Acids

To test our hypothesis, initially, the oxidation trifluoromethylation of phenylboronic acid under the optimal reaction
conditions of the oxidative trifluoromethylation of terminal
alkynes was investigated.14 When phenylboronic acid was
added by using a syringe pump to CuCF3 generated in situ
by combination of KF (5.0 equiv), Me3SiCF3 (5.0 equiv),
and CuI (1.0 equiv) in the presence of 1,10-phenanthroline
(phen, 1.0 equiv) in DMF at 70 °C under air atmosphere,
the products (including the desired product and byproducts)
formed from phenylboronic acid were not observed (Table
1, entry 1). Fortunately, when K3PO4 (3.0 equiv) was added

(2%) (entry 2). To improve the yield of PhCF3, different Cu
sources were further screened. Switching CuX (X ) I, Br,

desired product 2a was enhanced to 63% yield and the
byproduct Ph-X (3a) formed in the cases of CuX (X ) I,
Br, Cl, CN) was not detected, while byproducts phenol (4a),
PhOPh (5a), and PhPh (6a) were observed (entries 2-6).15
We surmised that the byproducts PhOH and PhOPh arose
from trace water in the air that was used as the oxidant.16
To overcome this hurdle, a suitable oxidizing agent instead
of air, which enables the late oxidation and followed by
reductive elimination and does not inhibit the generation of
CuCF3, was chosen. A series of oxidants were screened
(entries 7-15), and to our delight, silver carbonate (Ag2CO3)
displayed the best result for the Cu-mediated oxidative
trifluoromethylation (entry 14). A higher yield of 2a was
obtained when the [Cu(OTf)]2·C6H6 loading was increased
to 0.6 equiv (entry 16). Interestingly, further investigations
revealed that the reaction was conducted at a lower temperature (45 °C) with the highest yield of 2a (entry 17).
Utimately, optimal reaction conditions were found to be as
follows: 0.6 equiv of [Cu(OTf)]2.C6H5, 1.2 equiv of phen,
5.0 equiv of CF3SiMe3, 5.0 equiv of KF, 3.0 equiv of K3PO4,
and 1.0 equiv of Ag2CO3 in DMF at 45 °C. This afforded a
93% yield of 2a (entry 17).
The substrate scope of the copper-mediated oxidative
coupling reactions of arylboronic acids with in situ
generated CuCF3 was examined, and the results are
summarized in Scheme 2. The oxidative trifluoromethylation of arylboronic aicds has substantial scope. Both
electron-donating (1b-f,m) and electron-withdrawing
groups (1g-k) were tolerated. In contrast to traditional
cross-coupling reactions with aryl halides, electron-rich
arylboronic acids afforded slightly higher yields compared
to electron-deficient substrates. Functional groups such as
bromo, alkenyl, ester, and carbonyl groups are compatible
(1g-j). It is particularly noteworthy that the tolerance of
a bromo substituent (1d) provided a complementary
platform for further transformations via conventional
copper mediated cross-coupling reactions. The heterocyclic
arylboronic acids also served as suitable coupling partners
(1n-o). Importantly, the copper-mediated oxidative trifluoromethylations presented herein has also been easily
extended to alkenylboronic acids (1p-q).
The detailed mechanism remains to be elucidated. On
the basis of the previous work of trifluoromethylation of
terminal alkynes, it was reasonable to assume that the
reaction proceeds by the generation of reactive CuCF3 B

promote the oxidation of complex C to Cu(II) or Cu(III)

B is not clear at the moment.
