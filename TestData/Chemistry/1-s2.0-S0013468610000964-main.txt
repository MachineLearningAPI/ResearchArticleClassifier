Graphene was prepared successfully by introducing –SO3 − to separate the individual sheets. TEM, EDS
and Raman spectroscopy were utilized to characterize the morphology and composition of graphene
oxide and graphene. To construct the H2 O2 biosensor, graphene and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) were
co-immobilized into biocompatible polymer chitosan (CS), then a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) was
modiﬁed by the biocomposite, followed by electrodeposition of Au nanoparticles on the surface to fabricate Au/graphene/HRP/CS/GCE. Cyclic voltammetry demonstrated that the direct electron transfer of
HRP was realized, and the biosensor had an excellent performance in terms of electrocatalytic reduction
towards H2 O2 . The biosensor showed high sensitivity and fast response upon the addition of H2 O2 , under
the conditions of pH 6.5, potential −0.3 V. The time to reach the stable-state current was less than 3 s,
and the linear range to H2 O2 was from 5 × 10−6 M to 5.13 × 10−3 M with a detection limit of 1.7 × 10−6 M
(S/N = 3). Moreover, the biosensor exhibited good reproducibility and long-term stability.

1. Introduction
Graphene, which has been characterized as “the thinnest material in our universe” [1], has attracted a tremendous amount
of attention because of a few intriguing attributes it displays.
Graphene is a single layer of carbon atoms with a hexagonal
arrangement in a two-dimensional lattice. It can be seen as the
basic building block for graphitic materials. The unique properties
of graphene include fast electron transportation, high thermal conductivity, excellent mechanical stiffness and good biocompatibility
[2], which result in promising applications in nanocomposites [3],
ﬁeld-effect transistors [4], electromechanical resonators [5], solar
cells [6] and electrochemical sensors [7,8].
On the other hand, the determination of hydrogen peroxide
is of great importance in chemistry, biology [9,10], clinical control [11] and environmental protection [12]. Many techniques
have been developed to detect hydrogen peroxide, including
titrimetry [13], ﬂuorimetry [14], spectrophotometry [15], chemiluminescence [16] and electrochemical sensors [17–19]. Among
them, most involve high cost and are time consuming, except for
electrochemical sensors. Due to their simplicity, high sensitivity
and selectivity, electrochemical methods have been extensively

employed in hydrogen peroxide determination. Carbon nanotubes
(CNTs) have been widely used to fabricate electrochemical H2 O2
biosensors due to their high electrical conductivity and excellent electrocatalytic activity towards H2 O2 . Zhang and co-workers
successfully functionalized single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) with one kind of electroactive inorganic compound:
chromium hexacyanoferrate (Cr hcf). The nanocomposite-modiﬁed
glassy carbon electrode showed high electrocatalytic activity
towards the reduction of H2 O2 [20]. Pillay and Ozoemena fabricated a nanostructured phthalocyaninatoiron(II)/SWCNT-poly(maminobenzenesulfonic acid) hybrid system on a gold surface
using a layer-by-layer self-assembly strategy. The as-modiﬁed
electrode displayed a signiﬁcant ampliﬁcation of the electrochemical response to H2 O2 detection, suggesting that this CNTs-based
electrode could provide an important nano-architectural sensing
platform for the development of a sensor [21]. The successful utilization of carbon nanotubes as “molecular wires” has realized
the direct electron transfer between redox centers of enzymes
and electrodes, which leads to the new mediator-free biosensor [22–24]. Graphene, another carbon-based material, has shown
several characteristics that may be very beneﬁcial in designing electrochemical sensors, such as high surface area-to-volume
ratio, fast electron transferring rate and good biocompatibility.
Considering the convenient and low cost fabrication procedure,
graphene is expected to be a perfect alternative electrode material to carbon nanotubes. Recently, Niu and co-workers [7] have

3056

reported a novel glucose biosensor based on the combination of
polyvinylpyrrolidone-protected graphene, polyethylenimine functional ionic liquid and glucose oxidase. This biosensor has achieved
the direct electron transfer of glucose oxidase, maintained the
bioactivity of the enzyme and showed excellent electrocatalysis
towards glucose. These results demonstrate that graphene is an
eximious electrode material and can enhance the performance of
biosensors.
In this paper, we successfully utilized as-synthesized graphene
to construct a novel H2 O2 biosensor. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)
was selected as a model enzyme and immobilized in chitosan
(CS). Possessing a number of attractive properties such as high
permeability toward water, good adhesion, biocompatibility [25]
and good ﬁlm formation, the biopolymer chitosan is considered a
suitable matrix for enzyme immobilization and is widely used in
fabricating biosensors. Furthermore, chitosan is positively charged
when pH < 6.3 due to the protonation of amino groups. Because our
synthesized graphene is negatively charged due to the existence of
sulfonic groups, the graphene could be well dispersed in chitosan
solution via the Coulomb effect and formed a unique ﬁlm on the
surface of a glassy carbon electrode (GCE). We also introduced Au
nanoparticles into the H2 O2 biosensor due to their high surfaceto-volume ratio, good biocompatibility, high catalytic efﬁciency
and chemical stability [26]. It has been reported that the integration of carbon-based materials and metal nanoparticles liked
CNT–Pt composites offers synergistic effects in electrocatalytic
applications [27], so we have reasons to expect the graphene–Au
composite has the same effect. Electrodeposition was employed to
prepare the Au nanostructure ﬁlm on the graphene/HRP/CS modiﬁed electrode because it is a simple and controllable method. The
resulting biosensor exhibits excellent electrocatalytic response to
H2 O2 , along with a wide linear range and long-term stability.
2. Experimental
2.1. Reagents and materials
HRP (from horseradish, 250 U/mg) and chitosan (medium
molecular weight) were purchased from Sigma and used without further puriﬁcation. Graphite powder and HAuCl4 ·4H2 O were
purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. 30% H2 O2
solution was purchased from Shanghai Lingfeng Chemical Reagent
Co., Ltd, and a fresh solution of H2 O2 was prepared daily. All other
chemicals were of analytical grade and used as received. The 0.1 M
phosphate buffer solutions (PBS) at various pH values were prepared by mixing the stock solutions of 0.1 M NaH2 PO4 and 0.1 M
Na2 HPO4 with different proportion. The pure water (18 M cm)
used to prepare all solutions in this study was puriﬁed with a water
system provided by Shanghai Winner Environmental Technology
Co., LCD.
2.2. Apparatus
Electrochemical measurements were carried out with a CHI
660C workstation (CH Instruments, Chenhua, Shanghai, China) connected to a personal computer. A three-electrode conﬁguration
was employed, consisting of a modiﬁed glassy carbon electrode
(3 mm in diameter) serving as the working electrode, and Ag/AgCl
(3 M KCl) and platinum wire serving as the reference and counter
electrodes respectively. All electrochemical experiments were carried out at room temperature, and all experimental solutions were
degassed by nitrogen for at least 15 min. Then a nitrogen atmosphere was maintained during the electrochemical measurements.
The transmission electron microscope (TEM) and scanning
electron microscope (SEM) images were obtained using a JEOL-

2100F transmission electron microscope equipped with an INCA
X-ray energy dispersive spectrometer and a HITACHI S-4800 ﬁeld
emission scanning electron microscope. The EDS spectrum was
measured during the TEM measurements. Raman spectra were
recorded on an inVia Raman microprobe (Renishaw Instruments,
England) with 514 nm laser excitation.
2.3. Preparation of graphene
Graphene sheets tend to form irreversible agglomerates or
even restack to form graphite through van der Waals interactions
because they have a high speciﬁc surface area [28]. As most of
the unique properties are only associated with their individual
sheets, graphene sheets must be well separated from each other
using a few methods like protection with special molecules or
groups. Herein, we prepared sulfonated graphene (GS) according to
the literature with a little modiﬁcation [29]. Graphite oxide (GO),
prepared from natural graphite ﬂakes by a modiﬁed Hummer’s
method [30,31], was used as the starting material to prepare sulfonated graphene. In a typical procedure, 75 mg of graphite oxide
was dispersed in 75 g of water. After sonication for 45 min, a clear,
brown dispersion of graphene oxide was formed. Then, 600 mg of
sodium borohydride in 15 g of water was added into the dispersion
of graphene oxide after its pH was adjusted to 9–10 with 5 wt.%
sodium carbonate solution. The mixture was then kept at 80 ◦ C
for 1 h under constant stirring. After ﬁltering and washing with
water using a 0.2 ␮m Nylon Millipore ﬁlter, the partially reduced
graphene oxide could be redispersed in 75 g of water via mild sonication. The aryl diazonium salt used for sulfonation was prepared
from the reaction of 46 mg of sulfanilic acid and 18 mg of sodium
nitrite in 10 g of water and 0.5 g of 1 M HCl solution in an ice bath.
The diazonium salt solution was added to the dispersion of partially reduced graphene oxide in a cryostat (0 ◦ C) under stirring.
The mixture was kept in the cryostat for 2 h. After ﬁltering and
washing with water, sulfonated graphene oxide was redispersed
in 75 g of water. In the ﬁnal reduction step, 2 g of hydrazine in 5 g of
water was added into the dispersion and the reaction mixture was
kept at 100 ◦ C for 24 h under constant stirring. After ﬁltering and
washing with water thoroughly, the graphene thus prepared was
readily dispersed in water via a few minutes of sonication.
2.4. Preparation of biosensor
Prior to modiﬁcation, GCE was carefully polished with 1.0 ␮m,
0.3 ␮m and 0.05 ␮m ␣-alumina powders in sequence, rinsed thoroughly with pure water between each polishing step, sonicated in
ethanol and pure water for 5 min respectively and dried with nitrogen. Graphene was dispersed in 0.5% CS acetic acid solution with a
few minutes of ultrasonication to achieve a 0.5 mg/mL concentration (GS–CS). After the pH of GS–CS was adjusted above 5 by 1 M
NaOH, 20 ␮L of GS–CS and 10 ␮L of HRP solution (10 mg/mL) were
mixed adequately. Then 8 ␮L of the mixture (HRP/GS/CS) was cast
onto the surface of the GCE. After being dried in refrigerator at 4 ◦ C,
the electrode was immersed into a 0.2 M Na2 SO4 solution containing 1 mM HAuCl4 . Electrodeposition of Au was carried out under
−0.2 V for 300 s, followed by gentle washing in water and drying
in a refrigerator. For comparison, HRP/CS/GCE, Au/HRP/CS/GCE and
GS/HRP/CS/GCE were prepared with a similar method.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Characterization of graphene oxide and graphene
In order to avoid the agglomeration of graphene sheets, we
introduced a small number of p-phenyl-SO3 H groups into the product before it was ﬁnally reduced by hydrazine. The presence of

ture, the preservation of the morphology may be important to the
performance of graphene in as-prepared biosensors.
3.2. Electrodeposition of Au on HRP/GS/CS/GCE

Chitosan is a polysaccharide from the deacetylation of chitin.
It is positively charged when pH < 6.3 due to the protonation of
amino groups, and thus chitosan can electrostatically bind negatively charged AuCl4 − [36]. Under potentiostatic conditions, Au
nanoparticles can grow gradually on the surface of the electrode
modiﬁed with chitosan. Fig. 4 is the SEM image of the Au/HRP/GS/CS
modiﬁed electrode. It can be seen from the image that the Au
nanoparticles tend to form ﬂower-liked clusters. The inset is a magniﬁcation of a cluster, which shows that the diameter of one single
Au nanoparticle ranges from 30 nm to 40 nm.
3.3. Electrochemical behaviors of the biosensor

negatively charged –SO3 − kept the graphene sheets separate due
to electrostatic repulsion. Fig. 1 shows the EDS spectra of graphite
oxide (a) and graphene (b). Compare to GO, the O content of
graphene decreased markedly while the S element emerged, which
indicates that most of the oxygen functionalities contain –OH, –O–
and –COOH of graphite oxide were removed after reduction, and
–SO3 − was successfully imported.
Raman scattering, which is often used to monitor the structural changes of carbon materials, provided additional evidence
of graphene herein. As Fig. 2a shows, pristine graphite displays a
prominent peak at 1582 cm−1 known as the G band, which corresponds to the ﬁrst-order scattering of the E2g mode [32]. The
Raman spectrum of GO has two prominent peaks at 1602 cm−1 and
1349 cm−1 , corresponding to the well documented G and D bands
respectively. The G band broadened compared to pristine graphite,
mainly due to the extensive oxidation. After being reduced by
hydrazine, the Raman spectrum of graphene also contained both G
and D bands (1592 cm−1 and 1353 cm−1 ). However, the D/G intensity ratio increased in comparison with GO. Results obtained in this
study agree well with former research [33,34], indicating that GO
has been well deoxygenated into graphene.
A TEM image of graphene is shown in Fig. 3, clearly illustrating
that the transparent sheets are ﬂake-like with wrinkles, which may
be the key point leading to a gain in elastic energy for the quasitwo dimension crystallite to avoid dislocations caused by thermal
ﬂuctuations and keep a metastable state [35]. The TEM result indicates that the reduction and sulfonation procedures did not cause
the morphology of graphene to become damaged. As most unique
properties of graphene are dependent on its individual sheet struc-

is no redox peak current of HRP on the HRP/CS/GCE. This can be

explained by the deep embedding of the redox center of HRP in
a protein shell, which makes the distance between the active site
of enzyme and electrode farther than the distance that electrons
can transfer at a sufﬁcient rate. The insulation of the biopolymer chitosan further interrupts the electron transfer. In contrast,
the Au/HRP/CS/GCE and GS/HRP/CS/GCE both display a prominent cathodic peak current around −0.3 V, suggesting that direct
electron transfer was realized. The Au/GS/HRP/CS/GCE shows the
largest cathodic peak current compared to the other electrodes. As
we know, in an enzyme molecule, the rate coefﬁcient of electron
transfer between the donator and acceptor decreases exponentially with the distance between electron transfer centers [37].
After graphene and Au nanoparticles were introduced, the distance
between the active site and the microelectrodes was much smaller
than the original distance between the enzyme and the electrode
surface. The nanoscale individual sheets and particles both act as
“molecular wires” to connect the active sites with the electrode,
increasing the electron transfer rate signiﬁcantly. In addition, the
high conductivity of graphene is also responsible for the increased
current. Electrons can travel without being scattered off course by
lattice imperfections and foreign atoms in graphene due to the high
quality of its crystal lattice. The conduction electrons of graphene
move much faster and as if they had far less mass than the electrons

that wander about through ordinary metals and semiconductors
[38]. These two factors mentioned above make electron transfer in
the composite possible.
The CVs of Au/GS/HRP/CS/GCE in different concentrations of
H2 O2 were also investigated. As shown in Fig. 6, the cathodic peak
current increased dramatically upon the addition of H2 O2 , which is
a typical representation of the catalytic reduction of H2 O2 . The catalytic mechanism of the immobilized HRP to H2 O2 can be explained
by the following scheme [39]:

HRP reacts with H2 O2 to form a ﬁrst intermediate (Compound
I), which is a two-equivalent oxidized form containing an oxyferryl
heme (Fe4+ O) and a porphyrin ␲ cation radical. Compound I show
catalytic activity, and its porphyrin radical abstracts one electron
from the electrode to form a second intermediate (Compound II),
which is subsequently reduced back to the native HRP by accepting
one electron from the electrode [39].
The pH value of the electrolyte is important for the performance of the biosensor because the activity of the enzyme is
affected greatly by pH. Fig. 7 shows the amperometric response of
Au/GS/HRP/CS/GCE at different pH values with the presence of the
same concentration of H2 O2 . As can be seen, the response current

increased from pH 5.5 and reached the maximum at pH 6.5, then
decreased to pH 7.5. Strongly acidic or alkaline environments would
result in the denaturation of enzyme; however, a faintly acidic solution enhances the reaction because H+ is needed for HRP to reduce
the H2 O2 and produce water [40]. Therefore, pH 6.5 is selected as
the optimized value for the HRP, in agreement with the report that
HRP is entrapped in a CS matrix [41].
To comprehend the role of graphene in biosensors, four different
electrodes were prepared, and their current responses to the same
concentration of H2 O2 were studied. As Fig. 8 shows, HRP/CS/GCE
only yielded a negligible current response to the addition of 0.2 mM
H2 O2 , indicating that the direct electron transfer between the
HRP and the electrode is difﬁcult. A slight increase of current is
observed in Au/HRP/CS/GCE compared to HRP/CS/GCE mostly due
to the introduction of Au. The GS/HRP/CS/GCE caused an obvious increase in current, and when graphene was combined with
Au, a relatively high current response, which was 3 times larger
than Au/HRP/CS/GCE and almost 20 times larger than HRP/CS/GCE,
was observed. The different performances of electrodes are mainly
attributed to the excellent properties of graphene. These carbonbased individual sheets have good electrocatalytic activity towards
H2 O2 , and the high surface area-to-volume ratio is favorable
for enzyme immobilization. The eximious electronic conductivity beneﬁts the direct electrons transfer between the enzyme
and electrode, and furthermore, the good biocompatibility is
good for HRP to maintain bioactivity. The response current of
Au/GS/HRP/CS/GCE is larger than the summation of Au/HRP/CS/GCE
and GS/HRP/CS/GCE, distinctly illuminating the synergistic effect of
the Au–graphene composite.
The typical current–time plot of Au/GS/HRP/CS/GCE with successive injection of H2 O2 is given in Fig. 9. The working potential
was set at −0.3 V, where the amperometric response reached the
maximum value, as Fig. 5 shows. The biosensor responded rapidly

when H2 O2 was added and reached a steady state (95% of the maximum value) within 3 s, indicating a fast diffusion of the substrate in
the hybrid ﬁlm modiﬁed on the electrode and the high sensitivity
of the biosensor. Fig. 10 shows the calibration curve of the amperometric response. The biosensor has a good linear relationship with
H2 O2 in the range from 5 × 10−6 M to 5.13 × 10−3 M with a correlation coefﬁcient of 0.999, which is much wider than some other
hydrogen peroxide biosensors based on HRP [42–44]. The detection
limit was estimated to be 1.7 × 10−6 M at a signal-to-noise ratio of 3.
The Michaelis–Menten constant (Km ), which is a reﬂection of both
the enzymatic afﬁnity and the ratio of microscopic kinetic constant,
was calculated to be 2.61 mM according to the Lineweaver–Burk

Table 1.
3.4. Stability and reproducibility of the biosensor
The long-term stability of our fabricated biosensor was investigated by examining its current response during storage in a
refrigerator at 4 ◦ C. The biosensor exhibited no obvious decrease
in current response in the ﬁrst week and maintained about 92% of
its initial value after 3 weeks. The repeatability of the measurement
was obtained by detecting 0.05 mM H2 O2 10 times using the same
electrode. The relative standard deviation (R.S.D.) was found to be
3.6%. Five electrodes were prepared utilizing the same method to
check the reproducibility of the biosensor. To detect the same concentration of H2 O2 of 0.05 mM, the result revealed a R.S.D. of 4.2%,
which is acceptable.
4. Conclusion
In this paper, individual graphene sheets were successfully
prepared by the introduction of –SO3 − . EDS and TEM indicated
that the reduction and sulfonation procedures did not cause the
morphology of graphene to be damaged, which is important for
the maintenance of the excellent properties of graphene. The asprepared graphene was combined with CS, Au and HRP to construct
a H2 O2 biosensor. Cyclic voltammograms showed that the biosensor realized the direct electron transfer between HRP and the
electrode and exhibited the typical catalytic reduction of H2 O2 .
The comparison of the current response to the same concentration of H2 O2 of HRP/CS/GCE, Au/HRP/CS/GCE, GS/HRP/CS/GCE
and Au/GS/HRP/CS/GCE demonstrated that graphene can greatly
improve the sensitivity of the biosensor. In addition, the biosensor reveals some other excellent characteristics such as wide linear
range, low detection limit and long-term stability. In summary, the
biosensor with easy fabrication, low cost and good performance
proposed in this paper provides a new strategy for the construction
of H2 O2 biosensors and can be applied in practice.
