Two different mathematical formulas for estimating effective capacitance from Constant-Phase-Element
(CPE) parameters, taken from the literature, are associated unambiguously with either surface or normal
time-constant distributions. Application to different systems are used to illustrate the importance of
using the correct formula that corresponds to a given type of distribution. Experiments and simulations
are used to show that the effective capacitance obtained for a normal distribution yields correct values
for the ﬁlm thickness under conditions where the local resistivity does not vary signiﬁcantly. When the
local resistivity varies considerably over the thickness of a ﬁlm, the experimental frequency range may
preclude observation of the capacitance contribution of a portion of the ﬁlm, resulting in under prediction
of the ﬁlm thickness.

1. Introduction

a blocking electrode, Eq. (1) can be expressed as

The impedance response for electrochemical systems often
reﬂects a distribution of reactivity that is commonly represented
in equivalent electrical circuits as a constant-phase element (CPE)
[1–3]. The impedance associated with a simple Faradaic reaction
without diffusion can be expressed in terms of a CPE as

where Re is the Ohmic resistance and Rt is the charge-transfer resistance. The CPE parameters ˛ and Q are independent of frequency.
When ˛ = 1, Q has units of a capacitance, i.e., ␮F/cm2 , and represents the capacity of the interface. When ˛ < 1, the system shows
behavior that has been attributed to surface heterogeneity [4,5]
or to continuously distributed time constants for charge-transfer
reactions [6–10]. Independent of the cause of CPE behavior, the
phase angle associated with a CPE is independent of frequency. For

where Q represents the differential capacity of the interface in the
case where ˛ = 1.
It is clear that the CPE parameter Q cannot represent the capacitance when ˛ < 1. A number of researchers have explored the
relationship between CPE parameters and the interfacial capacitance. By treating a surface distribution of time constants, Brug et
al. [1] developed relationships between interfacial capacitance and
CPE parameters for both blocking and Faradaic systems. Hsu and
Mansfeld [11] proposed a different relationship in terms of Q, ˛ and
ωmax , which is the characteristic frequency at which the imaginary
part of the impedance reaches its maximum magnitude.
The formulas yield different results for the effective capacitance.
Using numerical simulations for the inﬂuence of geometry-induced
current distributions, Huang et al. [12] have shown that current
and potential distributions induce a high-frequency pseudo-CPE
behavior in the global impedance response of a disk electrode with
a Faradaic reaction [13]. Their work demonstrated that the Brug
formula for effective capacitance yielded a more accurate estimate
than did the Hsu and Mansfeld equation.

Both the Brug formulas and the Hsu and Mansfeld formula
have been widely used to extract effective capacitance values from
CPE parameters. The Brug formulas have been used to extract
capacitance values from CPE parameters for studies on double
layers [14–18], hydrogen sorption in metals [19,20], hydrogen
evolution [21–26], oxygen evolution [27], porous electrodes [28],
self-assembled monolayers [29,30], polymer ﬁlms [31], and passive
ﬁlms [32,33]. Similarly, the Hsu and Mansfeld formula has been
used to extract capacitance values from CPE parameters for studies
on passive ﬁlms [32–34], protective coatings [35–38], and corrosion inhibitors [39]. For a given set of CPE parameters, the Brug
formulas and the Hsu and Mansfeld formula yield different values;
yet, in some cases, both sets of equations have been applied to similar systems. The objective of this work is to explore the conditions
of validity for models which relate capacitance to CPE parameters.
2. Applicability of capacitance–CPE relations
Two types of time-constant distributions are envisioned. A variation of properties along the surface of an electrode can give rise
to a time-constant dispersion, which, for an appropriate distribution function, may be expressed as a CPE. A variation of properties
normal to the surface of an electrode can also give rise to a
time-constant dispersion, which, for an appropriate distribution
function, may be expressed as a CPE.

where Yi is the local admittance represented in Fig. 1(a), Re,i is the

can also be expressed in terms of the CPE represented by Eq. (1) as

Thus, the appearance of a CPE behavior associated with a surface
distribution of time constants requires the contribution of an Ohmic
resistance [40,41]. While an Ohmic resistance in physical systems
cannot be avoided, the example illustrated in Fig. 1(b) illustrates
the crucial role played by the Ohmic resistance in CPE behavior
associated with surface distributions.
Following the development of Brug et al. [1], the relationship
between CPE parameters and effective capacitance requires an
assessment of the characteristic time constant corresponding to
the admittance of the electrode. Thus,

where

In the case of a surface time-constant distribution, the global
admittance response of the electrode must include additive contributions from each part of the electrode surface. The situation
is demonstrated in Fig. 1(a), where a surface distribution of time
constants in the presence of an Ohmic resistance results in a
distributed time-constant behavior expressed as a summation of
admittances. For an appropriate time-constant distribution, the
impedance response may be expressed in terms of a CPE. Interestingly, in the absence of an Ohmic resistance, shown in Fig. 1(b),
the surface distribution of time constants results in an effective RC
behavior in which

Eqs. (10) and (11) are equivalent to Eq. (20) derived by Brug et
al. [1] for a surface distribution with a different deﬁnition of CPE
parameters. In the limit that Rt becomes inﬁnitely large, Eq. (11)
becomes
(1−˛)/˛

Ceff = Q 1/˛ Re

(12)

which is equivalent to Eq. (5) presented by Brug et al. [1] for a
blocking electrode.
2.2. Normal distributions

distributed time-constant behavior that, for an appropriate time-constant distribution, may be expressed as a CPE; and (b) distribution of time constants in the
absence of an Ohmic resistance resulting in an effective RC behavior. The admittance
Yi shown in (a) includes the local interfacial and Ohmic contributions.

In the case of a normal time-constant distribution through a
surface layer, the global impedance response of the electrode must
include additive contributions from each part of the layer. The situation is demonstrated in Fig. 2, where a normal distribution of time
constants results in a distributed time-constant behavior expressed
as a summation of impedances. For an appropriate time-constant
distribution, the impedance response may be expressed in terms
of a CPE. In this case, the appearance of a CPE behavior does not
require the contribution of an Ohmic resistance. The appearance
of a CPE from a series of Voigt RC elements does, however, require
contributions from both resistive and capacitive elements.

where Re is the Ohmic resistance and Ri and Ci represent the

contribute to the time-constant dispersions of a ﬁlm, the development can be performed in terms of an Ohmic resistance-corrected
impedance Z − Re .
The Ohmic resistance-corrected impedance of a ﬁlm can be

the global and local impedance responses of a blocking electrode
exhibiting a local CPE behavior. They were able to relate the global
impedance response to local impedance, and distinctive features of
the calculated global and local impedance response were veriﬁed
experimentally. A similar development was presented for a disk
electrode with a Faradaic reaction [13].
This work was used to explore the applicability of Eqs. (11), (12),
and (18) for determination of effective capacitance. The approach
allowed comparison between the estimated capacitance and the
value assumed for the simulations. The graphical methods presented by Orazem et al. [43] were used to obtain CPE parameters ˛
and Qeff . The parameter ˛ was obtained from
˛=

d log |Zj |

and Qeff was obtained from
Qeff = sin

(20)

The parameters ˛ and Qeff obtained by graphical evaluation of Eqs.
(19) and (20) are the same as would be obtained by regression analysis. As discussed by Huang et al. [13], the frequencies used for the
analysis were limited to those that were one decade larger than the
characteristic frequency because, in this frequency range, the value
of ˛ was well-deﬁned. The analysis took into account the observation that the value of ˛ was dependent on the frequency at which
the slope was evaluated.
The value of effective CPE coefﬁcient, Qeff , scaled by the interfacial capacitance C0 used for the simulations, is presented in Fig. 3 as
a function of dimensionless frequency K = ωC0 r0 /Ä, where r0 is the
disk radius, and Ä is the conductivity of the electrolyte. The results
given in Fig. 3 are presented as a function of the parameter J, incorporated as part of the boundary condition for Faradaic reactions at
the electrode surface. Under the assumption of linear kinetics, valid
for steady-state current densities ¯i much smaller than the exchange
current density i0 , the parameter J was deﬁned to be
J=

(˛a + ˛c ) Fi0 r0
RTÄ

(21)

where ˛a and ˛c are, respectively, anodic and cathodic apparent
transfer coefﬁcients. For Tafel kinetics, valid for ¯i
i0 , the parameter J was deﬁned to be a function of radial position on the electrode
surface as
J(r) =

˛c F ¯i(r) r0
RTÄ

(22)

Eq. (18) is equivalent to Eq. (3) presented without derivation by
Hsu and Mansfeld [11] in terms of ωmax . Eqs. (11), (12), and (18)
have all the same form, but the resistance used in the calculations
of Ceff is different in the three cases, being, respectively, the parallel
combination of Rt and Re for Eq. (11), Re for Eq. (12) and Rf for Eq.
(18).
3. Application
Eqs. (11), (12), and (18) were applied to different surface and
normal distributions for determination of effective capacitance.
3.1. Surface distributions
Huang et al. [12] have shown that current and potential distributions induce a high-frequency pseudo-CPE behavior in the global
impedance response of an ideally polarized blocking electrode with
a local ideally capacitive behavior. In a related work, Huang et al.
[42] explored the role of current and potential distributions on

(24)

Large values of J are seen when the Ohmic resistance is much
larger than the charge-transfer resistance, and small values of J
are seen when the charge-transfer resistance dominates. At high
frequencies, where frequency dispersion plays a signiﬁcant role,
the effective CPE coefﬁcient Qeff provides an inaccurate estimate
for the interfacial capacitance used as an input for the simulations,
even for small values of J where, as shown by Huang et al. [13], ˛ is
close to unity. As shown in Fig. 3, assumption that Qeff represents
the interfacial capacitance results in errors on the order of 500% at
K = 100.
Eqs. (12) and (11) are compared to the expected value of
interfacial capacitance in Figs. 4(a) and (b), respectively. Following
the observation by Huang et al. [13] that the geometry-induced
potential and current distributions yield a pseudo-CPE behavior in
which the coefﬁcient ˛ is a weak function of frequency, Figs. 4(a)
and (b) was developed using frequency-dependent values of ˛
and Qeff . Thus, the value of Qeff reported is that corresponding to
the value of ˛ at a given frequency K. The error in Eq. (12) is a
function of both frequency K and J. While Eq. (12) applies strictly
for a blocking electrode, it gives the correct answer for Faradaic
systems if one chooses to calculate ˛ at frequencies K < 5, but
fails for K > 5. The dependence on J is reduced signiﬁcantly when
both the Ohmic resistance Re and charge-transfer resistance Rt
are taken into account, and the errors in estimating interfacial
capacitance are less than 20%. The correction for Rt in Eq. (11) is
important for frequencies K > 5. Of the relationships tested, Eq.
(11) provides the best means for estimating interfacial capacitance
when frequency dispersion is signiﬁcant.
Eq. (18) was tested against the input value of interfacial capacitance in Fig. 5 where C0 is the known interfacial capacitance. While
Eq. (18) represents an improvement as compared to direct use
of the CPE coefﬁcient Qeff , the errors in estimating the interfacial
capacitance depend on both J and K and range between −70% and
+100%. Eq. (18), developed for a normal time-constant distribution,
is not appropriate for interpretation of results affected by a surface
time-constant distribution.

Eq. (18), developed for normal time-constant distributions, was
applied for determination of effective capacitance in two systems
in which a normal variation of resistivity may be expected.
3.2.1. Niobium
The anodic dissolution of a 0.25 cm2 Nb (99.9%, Goodfellow)
rotating disk electrode was studied in a pH 2 solution containing 0.1 M NH4 F and sodium sulfate as supporting electrolyte [44].
The experimental impedance data corresponding to an anodization
potential of 6 V(SCE) are shown in Fig. 6(a). According to the “surface charge approach” developed by Bojinov [45,46], the dielectric
properties of the oxide ﬁlm dominate the high-frequency response.
The medium-frequency inductive loop and low-frequency capacitive line are also described by Cattarin et al. [44] and Frateur [47].
Fig. 6(b) shows that a plot of the logarithm of the imaginary part
of the impedance as a function of the logarithm of the frequency
yields a straight line with a slope of −0.90 for frequencies higher
than 300 Hz, which indicates a CPE behavior with a CPE exponent
of 0.90 [43], rather than the response of a true Rf Cf parallel combination, where Rf is the oxide ﬁlm resistance and Cf is the oxide
ﬁlm capacitance. Furthermore, in Fig. 6(b), the surface distribution
caused by non-uniform current and potential distributions cannot
be observed in the high-frequency range since K = 1 would corre-

spond to 65 kHz and the maximum frequency that was used in the
experiments was 63.1 kHz [42].
The CPE parameters ˛ and Q for the high-frequency loop were
obtained using the graphical methods presented by Orazem et al.
[43] (Eqs. (19) and (20), respectively). The resulting values for different anodization potentials are presented in Table 1. The values
of the oxide ﬁlm resistance corresponding to the diameter of the
high-frequency loop are also reported in Table 1. From the CPE
parameters and the ﬁlm resistance, the effective capacitance of the
oxide ﬁlm was determined by application of Eq. (18) (see Table 1).
For normal time-constant distributions for which the dielectric constant may be assumed to be independent of position, the
capacitance should be related to ﬁlm thickness deff according to
Ceff =

εε0
deff

(25)

where ε is the dielectric constant and ε0 = 8.8542 × 10−14 F/cm is
the permittivity of vacuum. In the case of anodic dissolution of Nb
in acid ﬂuoride medium, the oxide is assumed to be Nb2 O5 and ε =
42 [48,49]. The values of deff are presented in Table 1 for different
anodization potentials.
The calculated values of deff can be compared to those given in
the literature. In Lohrengel’s review of metal oxides [50], different
values for the thickness of Nb2 O5 ﬁlms formed on Nb electrodes
at E = 0 V(SHE) are given that vary between 3 and 6.7 nm. Moreover, the formation ratio (i.e., the thickness increase caused by a
unit increase of the polarization potential) is reported to be 2.6 or
2.8 nm/V. Therefore, according to Lohrengel [50], the thickness ı
can be estimated approximately to be ı = 5.0 + 2.70E where ı has
units of nm and E is expressed in V(SHE). The method(s) used to
determine the oxide ﬁlm thicknesses and the electrolyte composition are not mentioned in Ref. [50]. Arsova et al. [51] measured the
thickness of Nb2 O5 ﬁlms formed in 1 M H2 SO4 by ellipsometry. The
formation ratio determined by these authors is 2.26 nm/V. Extrapolation of their ı to E = 0 V yields ı = 5 nm. Therefore, the thickness

found by Arsova et al. [51] can be estimated to be ı = 5.0 + 2.26E
where ı has units of nm and E is expressed in V(SHE). Habazaki et
al. [52] measured the thickness of the oxide by TEM of an ultramicrotomed section and by impedance. From their data, the thickness
can be estimated to be ı = 2.4 + 2.08E where ı has units of nm and
E is referenced to Pt in 0.1 M H3 PO4 . The values of Nb2 O5 ﬁlm thickness calculated by using Eqs. (18) and (25) for different anodization
potentials are compared with those calculated from the data of
Lohrengel [50], Arsova et al. [51] and Habazaki et al. [52] in Table 2.
The values of deff calculated by application of Eqs. (18) and (25)
to impedance data are in very good agreement with the literature
values, in particular with those obtained from non-electrochemical
measurements. Our results agree also with those of Heidelberg et
al. [53] who reported on the oxidation of 10 nm thick Nb layers in
micro- and nano-cells.
To show the consequence of the misuse of the resistance term
in the calculation of the effective capacitance, the values of Ceff
were calculated using Eq. (11) in which Rt was replaced by Rf . Eq.
(12) yielded the same values for Ceff as Eq. (11) since Rf
Re . As
before, Eq. (25) was used to estimate deff . Use of Eq. (12) yielded:
for 2 V(SCE), Ceff = 3.2 ␮F/cm2 and deff = 12 nm, for 6 V(SCE), Ceff =
0.9 ␮F/cm2 and deff = 41 nm, and for 10 V(SCE), Ceff = 0.5 ␮F/cm2
and deff = 74 nm. Comparison to the values presented in Table 1
shows that the effective ﬁlm thickness obtained using the effective
capacitance obtained from Eq. (12) can be signiﬁcantly larger than
the actual ﬁlm thickness, especially at high potential.
3.2.2. Human skin
Impedance data were collected for heat-separated excised
human stratum corneum obtained from the abdomen or the back
[54]. The separation procedure involved physical and mechanical
manipulations to separate the stratum corneum from the underlying dermis. Deionized water was the only solvent added during the
process. The skin samples were mounted between glass diffusion
cells prior to the impedance study. The skin and the solution were

the thickness of the skin depends on its dielectric constant ε. The
estimated thicknesses deff reported in Table 3 were obtained from
Eqs. (18) and (25) under the assumption that ε = 49. The value of
dielectric constant used in the present work was obtained by the
comparison, shown in a subsequent section, of the Young model to
the impedance data. The resulting values of deff of around 2 ␮m are
substantially smaller than the thickness of the stratum corneum,
which is accepted to have a value between 10 and 40 ␮m [58].
Eq. (12) was also used to calculate the effective capacitance.
As for the case of Nb2 O5 , Eq. (11) yielded similar values for Ceff
as Eq. (12) since Rf
Re . Eq. (25) was used to estimate deff . Use
of Eq. (12) yielded: for 0.0 h, Ceff = 4.5 × 10−3 ␮F/cm2 and deff =
9.6 ␮m, for 1.9 h, Ceff = 3.7 × 10−3 ␮F/cm2 and deff = 12 ␮m, and
for 5.1 h, Ceff = 3.1 × 10−3 ␮F/cm2 and deff = 14 ␮m. Interestingly,
the effective ﬁlm thickness calculated using the effective capacitance obtained from Eq. (12) was closer to the expected value than
was the thickness estimated using Eq. (18). The apparent better
agreement is found in spite of the fact that the Ohmic resistance
Re has no relationship to the dielectric property of the skin. This
work illustrates a need for a better understanding of the inﬂuence
of strong variations of resistivity on the impedance response.

maintained at constant temperature of 32 ◦ C with a water-jacketed
diffusion cell. Magnetic stir bars were used for each chamber of the
diffusion cell to keep the solutions well mixed. The electrochemical
impedance measurements were conducted with a Solartron 1286
potentiostat and a Solartron 1250 frequency-response analyzer. A
four-electrode conﬁguration was used for all of the studies. The
Ag/AgCl counter and working electrodes were produced by In Vivo
Metric. The Ag/AgCl reference electrodes were fabricated by Micro
Electrodes, Inc.
The slightly moistened epidermis was stored in between two
sheets of polymer ﬁlm in a refrigerator. At the start of a typical experiment the skin was removed from the refrigerator
and immersed in a 32 ◦ C 50 mM CaCl2 /20 mM HEPES solution
(pH of 6.95) which provided approximately the same pH and
ionic strength as the electrolytic ﬂuid within the body [55].
Replicate electrochemical impedance spectra were collected periodically using Variable-Amplitude Galvanostatic (VAG) modulation
[56,57]. The sinusoidal current perturbation was superimposed
about a 0 ␮A DC current bias, and the amplitude of the potential
response across the skin was maintained at ±10 mV. The individual scans took approximately 5 min and were shown to satisfy the
Kramers–Kronig relations, indicating that the system was stationary on the time scale of the experiments. Upon completion of an
impedance scan the skin was allowed to relax for 3 min before the
replicated spectrum was collected.
Impedance results are presented in Fig. 7(a) with immersion
time as a parameter. The straight lines evident at high frequencies in Fig. 7(b) show a high-frequency constant-phase behavior.
The CPE parameters ˛ and Q were obtained using the graphical

3.2.3. Films with an exponential decay of resistivity
The values of deff calculated using Eqs. (18) and (25) were in
very good agreement with the literature values for Nb2 O5 ﬁlms,
but the values obtained for human stratum corneum were substantially smaller than the expected values. Both the niobium oxide
[47,59,60] and the skin systems [61,62] have been described as
having a resistivity that decays exponentially with position. The
case of a ﬁlm with a uniform dielectric constant and an exponential decay of local resistivity is mathematically equivalent to the
Young model, in which an exponential increase in conductivity is
assumed [59,60]. The local resistance R(x) can be expressed as
−x/
0e

R(x) =

dx

(26)

where 0 is the maximum value of resistivity found at x = 0, which
corresponds to the oxide–electrolyte interface, and represents
a characteristic length. The effective resistance of the ﬁlm can be
obtained by integration over the ﬁlm thickness ı, i.e.,
ı

The local capacitance can be expressed as

where the dielectric constant ε was assumed to have a uniform

This result is in agreement with the direct integration of resistivity
which yielded Eq. (28). In the high-frequency limit,

(35)

This result is also in agreement with direct integration of capacitance which yielded Eq. (31).
The impedance response associated with Eq. (33) is presented
in Fig. 8 in dimensionless form with ı/ as a parameter. The
impedance was scaled by the zero-frequency asymptote given by
Eq. (34). The characteristic frequency indicated in the ﬁgure is in
dimensionless form following ωεε0 0 . For ı/ = 1, the peak in the
imaginary impedance is slightly smaller than 0.5 and the Nyquist
plot is only slightly depressed from perfect RC behavior. For larger
values of ı/ , distortion is evident at higher frequencies. The shape
of the plot remains unchanged for ı/ > 5. The absence of timeconstant dispersion at low frequencies indicates that the Young
model cannot account for the low-frequency behavior for skin seen
in Fig. 7(a).

To understand the relationship between Young impedance and
CPE behavior, impedance values calculated according to Eq. (33)
were analyzed by an Rf –CPE parallel combination, in series with
the electrolyte resistance. The CPE parameters Q and ˛ can be
obtained following the graphical methods outlined by Orazem et
al. [43]. The parameter ˛ can be obtained from the slope of the
imaginary part of the impedance plotted as a function of frequency in a logarithmic scale. The slope is presented in Fig. 9 as
a function of dimensionless frequency ωεε0 0 . At low frequency,
d log |Zj |/d log ω = 1, showing that the exponential decay of resistivity does not result in low-frequency time-constant dispersion.
At high frequency and for ı/ = 1, d log |Zj |/d log ω = −1, again
showing that the exponential decay of resistivity does not result in
high-frequency time-constant dispersion. For larger values of ı/ ,
a signiﬁcant frequency range above ωεε0 0 = 1 is seen for which
d log |Zj |/d log ω differs from −1.
The CPE parameters Q and ˛ were determined graphically for
each frequency above ωεε0 0 = 1. The effective capacitance was
calculated using Eq. (18), and the effective ﬁlm thickness was calculated using Eq. (25). The results are presented in Fig. 10(a) as a
function of dimensionless frequency and with ı/ as a parameter.
If the frequency is sufﬁciently large, the effective ﬁlm thickness deff
is equal to the actual ﬁlm thickness ı for any value of ı/ . For a
broad frequency range and for ı/ > 1, the effective ﬁlm thickness
obtained from the capacitance can clearly be signiﬁcantly smaller
than the actual ﬁlm thickness. For ı/ = 400, the effective ﬁlm

thickness is two orders of magnitude smaller than the actual ﬁlm
thickness for frequencies as high as ωεε0 0 = 105 .
The simulations show that, for ı/ = 5, the effective ﬁlm thickness abruptly approaches the actual ﬁlm thickness at ωεε0 0 = 102 .
A similar abrupt change is seen for ı/ = 10 at ωεε0 0 = 104 . The
simulations indicate that, while the capacitance obtained from the
impedance response for a ﬁlm with an exponential decay of resistivity should yield, in the limit of inﬁnite frequency, the correct
thickness of the ﬁlm, measurement over a ﬁnite frequency range
will yield a ﬁlm thickness that is substantially smaller. As shown in
Fig. 10(b), the effective ﬁlm thickness is larger than the characteristic length . Thus, the ﬁlm thickness obtained from the capacitance
can lie between the actual ﬁlm thickness ı and the characteristic
length .
4. Discussion
The results presented above show that, while Eq. (25) will be
valid in the limit of inﬁnite frequency, a ﬁnite experimentally acces-

6225

sible frequency range may render undetectable the capacitance
contributions from a portion of the ﬁlm. This effect may be signiﬁcant for cases where the local resistivity varies signiﬁcantly
with position. The effect is illustrated in Fig. 11. For a constant
capacitance C and local resistance R1 , measurement at frequencies
much below ω = 1/R1 C will yield only the resistance R1 because the
capacitor acts as an open circuit at these frequencies. In this case,
represented by the upper two RC elements in Fig. 11, the effective
capacitance obtained from Eq. (18) will under predict the thickness of the ﬁlm. Only the most resistive part of the ﬁlm is probed
by impedance. The capacitance elements that are not observed
by impedance can be either at the metal/ﬁlm interface or at the
ﬁlm/electrolyte interface.
The consequence is explored here for the speciﬁc case of a ﬁlm
with a uniform dielectric constant and an exponential decay of
resistivity. The dielectric response of both niobium oxide [47,59,60]
and skin [61,62] have been described in terms of exponential decays
of resistivity. Regression of such a model to the data obtained
for anodic dissolution of niobium at a potential of 6 V(SCE) in an
acid ﬂuoride medium yielded, for ε = 42, values of 0 = 2.66 × 109
cm, ı = 30 nm, and = 8 nm. Under these conditions, the simulation of an exponential decay of resistivity indicates that, for
frequencies above 5 kHz, ˛ ≈ 1 and deff /ı ≈ 1. A comparison of the
Young model to the impedance data for niobium oxide at a potential of 6 V(SCE), presented in Fig. 12(a), shows that the slope of
the Young model is equal to unity for frequencies greater than
5 kHz. The disagreement between the value of ˛ = 0.90 obtained
from experiment and the value of ˛ = 1 obtained from the model
indicates that the exponential decay of resistivity provides only
an approximate description of the high-frequency behavior of the
Nb2 O5 . Nevertheless, the simulation value of deff /ı = 1 is consistent
with the good agreement found between the thickness estimated
from the impedance measurement using Eqs. (18) and (25) and
values obtained by independent methods.
In vivo impedance experiments obtained by tape-stripping successive layers of skin from human subjects demonstrated that the
resistivity of human stratum corneum decays exponentially with
position [61,62]. A Young model analysis was therefore performed
for the in vitro data presented in Fig. 7 for heat-stripped human
stratum corneum. Model parameters were obtained by matching
the high-frequency portion of the impedance response given in
Fig. 7. The model parameters ε, 0 , and were selected to match
the zero-frequency asymptote for the real part of the impedance,
match the characteristic frequency at which the imaginary part of
the impedance had a maximum magnitude, and yield a dielectric
constant between the dielectric constant of water (ε = 80) and lipid
(ε = 2) [65]. The value of skin thickness was assumed to be either

20 ␮m or 40 ␮m, in keeping with reported values [61,62]. The comparison between the Young model and the data is given in Fig. 12(b),
and the resulting parameters are presented in Table 4. The characteristic length = 1 ␮m is in agreement with the data presented by
Kalia et al. [62], but is smaller than the value = 5 ␮m reported by
Yamamoto and Yamamoto [61]. Values of > 1.5 yielded, for the
present experimental data, dielectric constants that were greater
than that of water.
The values of ˛ and deff /ı reported in Table 4 were estimated
from the simulation at a frequency of 50 kHz. This frequency was
chosen for this analysis because it is at the upper limit of the experimental frequency range. As shown in Fig. 9, the Young model
provides only a pseudo-CPE behavior over a broad high-frequency
range in which the CPE parameters are weak functions of frequency.
The good agreement between the value of ˛ obtained from experiment and from the model suggests that the exponential decay
of resistivity provides a good description for the high-frequency
behavior of the skin. In addition, the simulation values for deff /ı
are consistent with the observation that the thicknesses estimated
from impedance measurements using Eqs. (18) and (25) were substantially smaller than those reported in the literature. The results
presented here support the observation by Oh et al. that the capacitance of the skin could not be measured after repeated removal
of skin layers reduced the impedance to a value indistinguishable
from that of the bathing medium [66].
The resistivity proﬁles corresponding to the simulations presented in this section are given in Fig. 13. The change in resistivity
for the Nb2 O5 ﬁlm is small enough that the entire dielectric
response of the ﬁlm can be seen in the experimental frequency
range. In contrast, the change in local resistivity of the skin is much
larger, and the capacitance associated with the region of smaller
resistivity values is not seen in the experimental frequency range.
Accordingly, the thickness estimated from the effective capacitance
is much smaller than the actual thickness of the skin. In this case,

the thickness obtained from impedance measurements is the thickness of the higher resistivity region. As illustrated in Fig. 10 for the
Young model, ı/ is the key parameter for determining the meaning of the effective ﬁlm thickness. When ı/ is small, the effective
thickness determined from the capacitance is the actual ﬁlm thickness. When ı/ is large, the effective thickness determined from
the capacitance is the thickness of only the resistive portion of the
ﬁlm.
5. Conclusions
Methods for determination of effective capacitance from CPE
parameters have been employed extensively in the impedance
literature. It is not obvious that all the authors who used the relationships derived by Brug et al. [1] and presented by Hsu and
Mansfeld [11] were fully aware that the former are appropriate only
for a surface distribution of time constants and the latter applies
only to a normal distribution, as is demonstrated in the present
work. The present results illustrate the importance of using the
correct formula that corresponds to a given type of distribution.
Misuse of the formulas, for example by using an incorrect effective resistance in the Ceff calculation, may lead to macroscopic
errors, since the values of electrolyte resistance, charge-transfer
resistance and ﬁlm resistance may be quite different. The selection
of the right formula should rest on the knowledge of the system
under investigation, obtained by different methods. For instance,
local impedance may provide evidence for surface/normal inhomogeneity; whereas, spectroscopic methods may show the presence
of ﬁlms for which properties might be distributed in the normal
direction.
The effective capacitance obtained for a normal distribution
can yield correct values for the ﬁlm thickness under conditions
where the local resistivity does not vary signiﬁcantly. When the
local resistivity varies considerably over the thickness of a ﬁlm,
the experimental frequency range may preclude observation of
the capacitance contribution of a portion of the ﬁlm. In this case,
the effective capacitance obtained from impedance measurements
will under-predict the ﬁlm thickness. The value of ﬁlm thickness
obtained from impedance data for such systems should be interpreted as being the thickness of the high-resistivity region that is
accessible to the impedance measurement.
