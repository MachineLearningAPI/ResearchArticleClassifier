a b s t r a c t
High quality graphene sheets were prepared from graphite powder through oxidation followed by
rapid thermal expansion in nitrogen atmosphere. The preparation process was systematically investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Raman spectroscopy
and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) measurements. The morphology and structure of graphene sheets
were characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and high-resolution transmission electron
microscopy (HRTEM). The electrochemical performances were evaluated in coin-type cells versus metallic lithium. It is found that the graphene sheets possess a curled morphology consisting of a thin wrinkled
paper-like structure, fewer layers (∼4 layers) and large speciﬁc surface area (492.5 m2 g−1 ). The ﬁrst
reversible speciﬁc capacity of the prepared graphene sheets was as high as 1264 mA h g−1 at a current density of 100 mA g−1 . Even at a high current density of 500 mA g−1 , the reversible speciﬁc capacity remained
at 718 mA h g−1 . After 40 cycles, the reversible capacity was still kept at 848 mA h g−1 at the current density of 100 mA g−1 . These results indicate that the prepared high quality graphene sheets possess excellent
electrochemical performances for lithium storage.

1. Introduction
Lithium-ion batteries have been widely used in portable electronic devices and regarded as promising devices in the application
of electric vehicles. The energy density and performance of
lithium-ion batteries largely depend on the physical and chemical
properties of cathode and anode materials. Graphite is the widely
commercial anode material for lithium-ion batteries because of its
high columbic efﬁciency and better cycle performance. However,
the theoretical speciﬁc capacity of graphite is only 372 mA h g−1
(by forming intercalation compounds (LiC6 )) [1]. Because of the
capacity limit of graphite, the energy density of lithium-ion battery cannot satisfy the requirement of portable electronic devices
and recently developed full electric vehicles. To meet the increasing demand for batteries with high energy density, much effort has
been made to explore new anode materials [2–6].
Graphene is the name given to a two-dimensional sheet of sp2 hybridized carbon. Its extended honeycomb network is the basic
building block of other important allotropes: it can be stacked to
form 3D graphite, rolled to form 1D nanotubes, and wrapped to
form 0D fullerenes [7]. So far, 1D nanotubles and 0D fullerenes

have been used as anode materials in lithium-ion batteries and
exhibit improved electrochemical performances [8–14]. But these
carbon materials only show a limited enhancement of the performance compared with 3D graphite. Freestanding graphene was
experimentally discovered by Novoselov and Geim in 2004 [15],
but its chemical and physical understanding is still in the primary
stage [16]. Recently, graphene nanosheets as anode materials were
investigated and exhibited large reversible capacity [14,17–19], but
the graphene nanosheets used in lithium-ion batteries consists
of more layers. It is well known that the performance of nanomaterials largely depends on their structures and morphologies,
therefore, the graphene sheets with fewer layers maybe have better
electrochemical performances. Indeed, it has been demonstrated
that the graphene sheets of ca. 0.7 nm thickness could provide
the highest storage density (with a Li4 C6 stoichiometry) by density of states calculations [20]. Single graphene sheets derived
from splitting graphite oxide have been successfully prepared
by Schniepp through thermal exfoliation in 2006 [21]. However,
to our best knowledge, the electrochemical performances of the
graphene sheets with fewer layers have never been reported. In
this study, high quality graphene sheets with fewer layers (∼4
layers) and large speciﬁc surface area (492.5 m2 g−1 ) were successfully prepared through thermal exfoliation. The electrochemical
performances for the lithium storage were evaluated in coin-type
cells.

2. Experimental
2.1. Synthesis of graphene sheets
Graphene sheets were prepared in two steps: graphite powder
(Shanghai Colloid Chemical Plant, China) was oxidized to graphite
oxide via a modiﬁed Hummers’ method [22], and then rapidly exfoliated at high temperatures under nitrogen atmosphere to obtain
graphene sheets. In a typical reaction, 2 g graphite powder with
the average particle size 30 ␮m, 2 g sodium nitrate (AR, Tianjin Fu
Chen Chemical Reagent Factory, China) and 100 mL of concentrated
sulfuric acid (AR, Beijing Chemical Plant, China) were mixed and
strongly stirred for 15 min in a 1000 mL reaction ﬂask immersed
in an ice bath. Then 12 g potassium permanganate (AR, Guangzhou
Chemical Reagent Factory, China) was slowly added to the above
solution and cooled for 30 min in the ice bath. After the ice bath
was removed and the suspension was continuously stirred for 48 h,
184 mL of pure water was slowly added to the suspension in 15 min.
Subsequently, the suspension was further treated with 560 mL of
warm water and 40 mL of H2 O2 (30%, AR, Guangzhou Chemical
Reagent Factory, China) to reduce residual permanganate and manganese dioxide to colorless soluble manganese sulfate. The mixture
was centrifuged at 4000 rpm and washed with a mixed aqueous
solution of 6 wt% H2 SO4 /1 wt% H2 O2 , then washed with water and
dried in a vacuum oven at 60 ◦ C for 36 h to obtain graphite oxide.
The obtained graphite oxide was exfoliated at 1050 ◦ C under nitrogen atmosphere for several minutes, and then the desired graphene
sheets were obtained.
2.2. Characterization of graphite, graphite oxide and graphene
sheets
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained from PHILIPSPW1710 using Cu/Ka radiation ( = 1.5406 Å). Fourier transform
infrared (FTIR) spectra were recorded with a Bruker Vector 33 FTIR
spectrometer. Brunauer–Emmet–Teller (BET) speciﬁc surface area
was determined from N2 adsorption by using a Micromeritics ASAP
2010 (USA) analyzer at liquid nitrogen temperature. Raman spectra
were measured using a Horiba Jobin Yvon LabRam Aramis Raman
spectrometer with a laser of 632.8 nm. The morphology and structure of the prepared graphene sheets were observed by scanning
electron microscope (SEM, Quanta 200F) and high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM, FEI, Tecnai G2 F30 S-Twin).

graphene sheets.

3. Results and discussion
XRD patterns of graphite powder, graphite oxide and graphene
sheets are presented in Fig. 1. The XRD pattern of graphite powder exhibits a characteristic peak (0 0 2) of graphite at 26.58◦ . After
oxidation, the (0 0 2) peak of graphite powder disappears and an
additional peak at 11.36◦ is observed, which is corresponding to the
(0 0 1) diffraction peak of graphite oxide. The d-spacing of graphite
oxide increased to 0.779 nm from 0.335 nm of graphite powder,
which is ascribed to the oxide-induced O-containing functional
groups and inserted H2 O molecules [17] that can be conﬁrmed by
FTIR. These results suggest that the graphite powder has been completely oxidized. After rapid heat treatment, the diffraction peak of
graphite oxide disappears, indicating that the graphite oxide has
successfully exfoliated to graphene sheets. The successful exfoliation of graphite oxide can also be proved by the BET and SEM.
Fig. 2 shows FTIR spectra of graphite oxide and graphene sheets.
For graphite oxide, the peak at 3413 cm−1 can be attributed to
O–H stretching vibrations of adsorbed water molecules and structural OH groups, and the peak at 1626 cm−1 can be attributed

2.3. Electrochemical testing of graphene sheets in lithium-ion
batteries
The electrochemical experiments were carried out using the
coin-type cells that was described in previous work of our group
[23,24]. The working electrodes were prepared as following: the
graphene sheets and poly(vinylidene ﬂuoride) (PVDF, Kureha,
Japan) binder at the weigh ratio of 9:1 were homogenously mixed
and pasted on a copper foil, then dried at 120 ◦ C in a vacuum oven
(DZF-6020, Shanghai Qi Xin Scientiﬁc Instrument Co. Ltd., China).
The lithium sheet was used as both counter and reference electrodes. The Celgard 2325 microporous polypropylene ﬁlm was used
as separator. The electrolyte was 1 M LiPF6 dissolved in a mixture
of ethylene carbonate (EC) and dimethyl carbonate (DMC) (1:1 by
volume) (Beijing Institute of Chemical Reagents, China). The cells
were galvanostatically discharged (Li insertion) and charged (Li
extraction) in the voltage range from 0.01 V to 3.5 V at the current
densities of 100 mA g−1 , 300 mA g−1 , 500 mA g−1 and 1000 mA g−1
using a Battery Testing System (Neware Electronic Co., China).
Cyclic voltammetry measurements were carried out on an electrochemical workstation (Zahner IM6ex) over the potential range
0.01–3.5 V vs. Li/Li+ at the scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1 .

to O–H bending vibrations [25,26]. The presence of carboxyl and
epoxy functional groups can also be detected at around 1735 cm−1
and 1225 cm−1 , 1053 cm−1 , respectively [17,25–27]. These evidences indicate that during the oxidation process of the graphite
powder with KMnO4 in the concentrated sulfuric acid, the original extended conjugated ␲-orbital system of the graphite were
destroyed and oxygen-containing functional groups were inserted
into carbon skeleton. However, after a rapid thermal treatment,
these functional groups derived from the intensive oxidation were
eliminated, which can be proved by the disappearance of the
peaks at 1735 cm−1 , 1626 cm−1 , 1225 cm−1 and 1053 cm−1 while an
appear of a new peak at 1565 cm−1 reﬂecting the skeletal vibration
of graphene sheets [18]. These evidences indicate that the graphite
oxide have been successfully exfoliated to graphene sheets by thermal exfoliation.
The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of graphene sheets
are shown in Fig. 3. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) speciﬁc
surface area of graphene sheets is about 492.5 m2 g−1 . Comparing with the graphite powder (about 8.5 m2 g−1 , the detailed data
was not shown), the graphene sheets possess much larger special surface area, which indicates that the average particle size of
graphite has been decreased during oxidation and rapid heating
process under nitrogen atmosphere. Although the speciﬁc surface
area (492.5 m2 g−1 ) of the graphene sheets is smaller than the
theoretical speciﬁc surface area of single-layer graphene sheets
(2620 m2 g−1 ), the speciﬁc surface area of our graphene sheets
is still much larger than those of previously reported graphene
nanosheets (184 m2 g−1 ) [17]. Furthermore, it should be pointed
out that a hysteresis loop in the nitrogen adsorption/desorption
isotherms of graphene sheets was also observed, which indicates
that the graphene sheets are porous. The hysteresis loop resembles
type H3 IUPAC (International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry)
classiﬁcation, resulting from slit-shaped pores between parallel
layers [27]. The total pore volume of graphene sheets is as high
as 2.28 cm3 g−1 , but the micropore volume is only 0.03 cm3 g−1 ,
revealing a very low micropore content. The average pore diameter
is about 12.55 nm calculated by the BET model.
Signiﬁcant structural changes occurring during the chemical
processing from graphite to graphite oxide and to graphene sheets
can also be characterized by Raman spectroscopy, as shown in Fig. 4.
The Raman spectrum of graphite displays a G band (1569 cm−1 ) corresponding to the ﬁrst-order scattering of the E2g mode observed
for sp2 domains and D band (1343 cm−1 ) which is ascribed to edge
planes and disordered structures [28–30]. In the Raman spectrum
of graphite oxide, the G band is broadened and shifted to 1578 cm−1 ,

Fig. 4. Raman spectra (D and G bands) of (a) graphite powder, (b) graphite oxide
and (c) graphene sheets.

and a broad D band at 1335 cm−1 also appears. The Raman spectrum
of graphene sheets also contains both D and G bands (at 1580 cm−1
and 1330 cm−1 , respectively). However, the D/G intensity ratio
(ID /IG = 1.19) is larger than that of graphite oxide (ID /IG = 1.07). The
data indicate that extensive oxidation and rapid thermal exfoliation have induced a substantial decrease of the size of the in-plane
sp2 domains, as well as an increase of edge planes and the degree
of disorder in the prepared graphene sheets [28–32].
Fig. 5a and b present the low-magniﬁcation SEM pictures of
graphene sheets from which the morphology of secondary particles can be observed. The agglomeration of the particles possibly
occurs. Fig. 5c and d show the moderate-magniﬁcation SEM images
of graphene sheets, a curled morphology, that the graphene intrinsically owns [33], consisting of a thin wrinkled paper-like structure
can be observed from the SEM picture. It’s obvious that the stacking of graphene sheets is substantially disordered and the graphene
sheets were agglomerated and overlapped, which is consistent with
the results of Raman. The high-magniﬁcation SEM images (Fig. 5e
and f) revealed that most of the graphite oxide has been efﬁciently
exfoliated to ultrathin sheets with wavy structures. In the case
of the graphene sheets one may thought about that it could be
easy to form a porous structure since the curled and wrinkled
graphene sheets stacked together disorderly, the porous structure
has been conﬁrmed by the BET. The thickness of the graphene
sheets can be observed from high-resolution transmission electron
microscopy (HRTEM) images (Fig. 5g and h). The thickness of the
graphene sheets is approximately 2.1 nm and the graphene sheets
are composed of approximately four stacked individual monatomic
graphene layers according to the thicknesses of single-, doubleand triple-layer graphenes are approximately 0.57 nm, 1.25 nm and
1.83 nm, respectively [34]. It’s obvious that the graphene sheets
obtained by a long time oxidation followed by a rapid thermal treatment in nitrogen atmosphere possess fewer layers compare with
previously reported graphene nanosheets (more than 20 layers)
[18]. It should be noted that the theoretical speciﬁc surface area of
2620 m2 g−1 only can be observed when all the graphene sheets are
single layer and all surfaces are exposed [31,35,36]. Since our prepared graphene sheets obtained through rapid thermal treatment
were composed of four stacked individual monatomic graphene
layers and they were agglomerated and overlapped, therefore, the
smaller speciﬁc surface area was observed compare with the theoretical one. Obviously, the more the layers of graphene sheets, the

smaller the speciﬁc surface area. This is well consistent with the
results of BET and TEM.
Fig. 6 presents the ﬁrst ﬁve discharge/charge proﬁles of the
prepared graphene sheets at the current density of 100 mA g−1 . It
can be seen that the voltage curve of the ﬁrst discharge process
is obviously different from the second one. The graphene sheets
with fewer layers shows an irreversible capacity at about 0. 75 V
in the ﬁrst cycle, which could be attributed to the formation of
a solid electrolyte interface (SEI) ﬁlm on the electrode surface
of the graphene sheets electrode and the reaction of lithium ion
with residual oxygen-containing functional groups [4,37,38]. The
ﬁrst discharge and charge capacities of graphene sheets were as
high as 2035 mA h g−1 and 1264 mA h g−1 , respectively. Obviously,
the reversible capacity of graphene sheets with fewer layers is
much higher than that of previously reported graphene nanosheets
(540 mA h g−1 at a low current density of 50 mA g−1 ) [14]. The
possible reason is that the larger surface area and curled morphology of graphene sheets with fewer layers can provide more
lithium insertion active sites, such as edge-type sites, nanopores
[39]. The possible reversible reaction of Li with the residual H in
the graphene sheets and faradaic contribution are also favorable
to the large reversible capacity [40]. It’s well known that the disordered carbons can yield higher capacity values than graphite
[41–44], and the graphene can be considered as a very disordered
carbon. Furthermore, it should be noted that the graphene sheets
electrode exhibits a broad electrochemical window (0.01–3.5 V)
as a function of lithium capacity and large voltage hysteresis
between discharge and charge voltage curves, which is different
from graphite (Fig. 7) and similar to the disordered carbons [40–44].
Although the exact insertion/extraction mechanism of lithium ions
in graphene sheets is not clear yet, the insertion/extraction mechanisms of lithium ions in graphene sheets and graphite should be
different. The reversible speciﬁc capacity of the prepared graphene
sheets reduced to 1193 mA h g−1 in the second cycle, but it was
still maintained at 1144 mA h g−1 in the ﬁfth cycle. This evidence
indicates that the prepared graphene sheets exhibited stable cyclic
performance from second cycle because of the formed stable solid
electrolyte interphase ﬁlm during the ﬁrst discharge process.
The cyclic voltammograms (CV) of the prepared graphene sheets
with fewer layers are shown in Fig. 8. The shape of the CV curves
matches well with the discharge/charge proﬁles (Fig. 6). Fig. 9
presents the discharge/charge voltage curves at high current den-

sities. At the current densities of 300 mA g−1 , 500 mA g−1 and
1000 mA g−1 , the corresponding reversible speciﬁc capacity of the
prepared graphene sheets can reach 936 mA h g−1 , 718 mA h g−1
and 445 mA h g−1 , respectively, indicating that the graphene sheets
with fewer layers possess high rate discharge/charge capability. The
high rate discharge/charge properties are likely to originate in the
shortened diffusion distance of lithium ions into the host position
of the graphene sheets with fewer layers and porous structure [16].
Cycle performance of graphene sheets at different current densities
of 100 mA g−1 , 300 mA g−1 , 500 mA g−1 and 1000 mA g−1 are shown
in Fig. 10. After 40 cycles, it was found that the reversible capacity was still maintained at 848 mA h g−1 for graphene sheets with
fewer layers, which is much higher than that of previously reported
graphene nanosheets (290 mA h g−1 after 20 cycles at a low current density of 50 mA g−1 ) [14]. These results demonstrated that
the prepared graphene sheets with fewer layers have an intensive
potential as a candidate of anode materials with high reversible
capacity, good cycle performance and high rate discharge/charge
capability.
4. Conclusions
The high quality graphene sheets with a curled morphology
consisting of a thin wrinkled paper-like structure, fewer layers
(∼4 layers) and a large speciﬁc surface area (492.5 m2 g−1 ) were
prepared using a thermal exfoliation method. The electrochemical
performance testing showed that the ﬁrst reversible speciﬁc capacity of the prepared graphene sheets was as high as 1264 mA h g−1 at
a current density of 100 mA g−1 . After 40 cycles at different current
densities of 100 mA g−1 , 300 mA g−1 , 500 mA g−1 and 1000 mA g−1 ,
the reversible speciﬁc capacity was still maintained at 848 mA h g−1
at the current density of 100 mA g−1 , which indicated that the prepared graphene possesses a good cycle performance for the lithium
storage. The results reported here are of interest with respect to
possible applications of graphene sheets for lithium-ion batteries.
However, the large hysteresis and the initial irreversible capacity
that were observed in the discharge-cycles of the graphene sheets
would be a main drawback for their use in commercial batteries.
