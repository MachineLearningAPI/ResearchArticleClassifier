Abstract: This paper presents studies about Internet Protocol Television
(IPTV) technology starting with its motivation that led to its birth and its
great and current application. The article theoretical basis will present the
description of mechanisms, standards and main protocols used to ensure a
quality of service needed to the deployment of IPTV applications. Among
them, we will mention Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS). It will be
made a case study, including a corporate network of a large a mining
company, which simulates the core of a provider network between data
concentrator branches. The aim of this simulation is to analyze the
network behavior after ITPV traffic insertion and serve as a basis to
obtain conclusions about the possibility of developing new applications
that use this technology.
Keywords: IPTV, QoS, MPLS

Introduction
With the ever increasing necessity of multimedia
files transference, there is a natural need of evolution
in providing such services, what can be perceived in
opening a range of options, among them the
appearance of television broadcasting via digital way,
that is, television signals digitalization and
transference through computers Internet Protocol (IP)
network. An advantage in researching Internet
Protocol TeleVision (IPTV) platform is the
predominant basis on software with the transport of its
contents through the set of IP internet protocols that
ensures an implementation of service quality (Shihab
and Cai, 2007; Tanenbaum, 2003; Uzunalioglu, 2009;
Vieira and Maurício, 2010).
The IPTV platform can be offered or implemented for
any user who with an adequate infrastructure of robust
network with minimum speed for transmission. Therefore,
in corporate area, this service has being adopted and
aligned for automation services and monitoring remote
areas, telepresence meetings and etc.
In IPTV platform infrastructure, it includes
encoders, decoders, middleware equipment, videos
and the equipment that creates these videos. A width
of minimum band is required to obtain a good
transmission for the user. The most used media
standard, today, is the Moving Pictures Expert Group
(MPEG-2), which requires between 3-9 Mbps of
bandwidth (Zeadally et al., 2011).
Nowadays, corporate companies are increasingly
being adapted to technological advances and taking

advantage of opportunities to add value to the services
offered in a more innovative and effective way. This
paper proposes to make a viability study on the
implementation of applications that use IPTV
technology. It will be made a comparison of current
and future consumption of bandwidth in the core of
data network of the company, what will enable a
behavior analysis about this new setting.

Standards, Architecture and Protocols
To create a television system over IP, it is
necessary that its architecture is separated into some
layers needed for services grouping and well-defined
files. Nowadays, these layers are covered by
standards, reflecting in an effort to interoperate
several market IPTV systems. The standards are
specifically understood as coding the videos that will
be sent. The delivery of multimedia services, both
interactive and personalized, are objects of
standardization for several institutions, such as,
International
Telecommunication
UnionTelecommunication (ITU-T) and Open IPTV Forum
(Yarali and Cherry, 2005).
The ITU-T institution has a group formed to
accomplish the mission to globally standardize IPTV
services. This group is based on the consumer-server
architecture with the additional of services delivery
platform, considering the areas of digital rights
record, Quality of Service (QoS) and Quality of
Experience (QoE). The quality of service is presented

mainly from the network layer. This equipment is
mainly represented by the router capable of
connecting autonomous systems of other
networks facilitating the information traffic

as set of activities which ensure the optimization of
the logical network for delivering the IPTV packets,
due to the packet loss, speed of delivery and end-toend delay. Among these activities, it is included from
implementation of specific protocols as MPLS and
Multicast protocols, to policies of traffic prioritization
or architectures of integrated and differentiated
services. Whereas the quality of experience translates
all technical efforts applied in the network through the
broad perception of the user of this service.
A very important institution inserted in the process
of this standardization is Telecoms & Internet
Converged Services & Protocols for Advanced
Networks (TISPAN) that is a group of work of
European Telecommunications Standards Institute
(ETSI), which defines IPTV service as the next
generation of networks, that is, Next Generation
Networks (NGN). Another important contribution of
this process is in the inclusion by Open IPTV Forum
of legacy network architectures, integrating the
totality of wired networks (Zeadally et al., 2011).
For the transmission of IPTV services, it is made
important mention to Digital Video Broadcast (DVB),
standard document that specifies the first intentions of
specification for live video and radio transmission,
possessing or not interaction its control. The most
popularly accepted and open for improvements codec
(encoding algorithm) is MPEG-2 Systems, which is
focused on the combination of elementary stream of
audio and video produced by IPTV architecture.
However, MPEG works in very relevant different
specifications for IPTV as MPEG-E, MPEG-7 and
MPEG-21. Besides, it has a component in relation to
the
improvement
in
multimedia
resources
management for consumption, protection and creation
(Zeadally et al., 2011).
The architecture of an IPTV platform can be
included in the following layers:
•

•

•

The Fig. 1 shows the representation of a basic
IPTV network architecture.
From this figure, we can clearly identify each of the
basic layers that an IPTV architecture or technology
platform needs to be able to offer videos services.
This paper will be occupied in studying the traffic
inserted in the regional aggregation network, that is,
the “core” data network. It will be made a simulation
of capacity required to the provider on the part of the
company under study and later insertion of IPTV
traffic for capacity analysis. It will be analyzed if the
router located on the edge of the studied locality will
have the transmission capacity of this new data
stream, ensuring the minimal requirement of service
quality for proper functioning.
The Quality of Service can be achieved through
several implemented techniques and protocols. The
main ones are through the IntServ (Integrated Services,
solution that provides QoS with the resource reservation
with RSVP protocol-Resource Reservation Protocol)
architectures, in which it is ensured through native
messages of PATH and RESV protocols exchange
throughout the circuit extension with QoS (all equipment
must have resources for this kind of connection). This is
made with an admission control which verifies if the
network has the needed conditions for such a measure. In
large groups with implemented multicast, the reservation
through RSVP protocol is accomplished from the recipient
where the Set-Top-Box would perform the request
compatible with its needs.
Whereas in the Differentiated Services, solution
with packets prioritization (DiffServ) architecture, the
data stream or the packets are selected in priorities
through the Differentiated Services Code Point
(DSCP) field, that is, there is no network resource
reservation as in the IntServ, it only prioritizes the
packets that will traffic. This mechanism becomes a
simpler and more scalable implementation, for it can
be treated packets of different data streams. Before
companies’ information policy, this architecture
becomes well manageable. The DiffServ solution is
defined by IETF through RFC 2475 (Reis Correa and
Sodré dos Reis, 2012).
The Multiprotocol Label Switching has become a
technology widely used by service provider companies
and large corporations which implement WAN networks
(Wide Area Networks). This is possible because it
implements a packet switching technique through small
labels, enabling faster forwarding between the nodes,
preventing huge IP address researches in tables.

A home network: This network is in the user’s
side who has a gateway equipment (a device that
interconnects networks) serving as a kind of
modem to connect one or more Set-Top-Boxes
(converters), to then decode IPTV channels for
exhibition and control in accessing
An access network: The access network serves as
connectivity provider for a users’ home network.
In this network it is found the equipment of link
layer as switches of Ethernet networks to execute
improved functions of interoperabilities, multicast
protocols support and etc. There are several
access techniques as an option of very-high-bitrate digital subscriber line (SW VDSL)
Regional aggregation networks: They are
networks represented by large data providers, that
is, a network consisting of a large mesh of
packets or data communications equipment,

Another great advantage of MPLS comes from its
possibility to encapsulate packets of several network
protocols, supporting a variety of technologies.
The MPLS is standardized by Internet Engineering
Tasking Force (IETF) through RFC 3031. Besides serving
as a mechanism for network traffic engineering, it
simplifies the routers function and drastically decreases
the packets overhead and latency.
The MPLS, along with the technologies and protocols
present in both architectures mentioned above, acts in a
complementary way, aggregating router and switching
advantages, where the administrator shall choose the
prioritization and technology for its configuration of better
application performance.
As a consequence of quality of service application
in the network, it arises a very important concept
called Quality of Experience (QoE), that is, it
translates the user’s perception based on the experiences
previously obtained in these applications. Although QoE
is very subjective, there are numerical and statistical
parameters about these streams over the network able to
indicate the superior or inferior limit of expected quality.
The most relevant QoS requirements able to show and
indicate these limits are throughput (bandwidth

consumption by the application), delay (maximum time of
origin-destination delivery), jitter (variation in delivery
delay) and packet loss (tolerance limit for application).
According to the Table 1, the requirements to
ensure a good QoE in different categories of IPTV
applications are the following (Barros, 2011):
The requirement flow varies due to the encoder
that is used in the application, for example, the
MPEG-2 needs an average of 4Mbps per SDTV
channel. Whereas MPEG-4 uses 2Mbps per channel.
The packet loss becomes very relevant in the analysis
since this requirement directly compromises on
transmission quality. Therefore, a percentage less than
0.5% becomes satisfactory without great damage.

Methodology
The simulation is based on the IPTV traffic
insertion in a data corporate network to technically
evaluate the impact this will result in its behavior and
performance. This is a case study of a large
corporation for insertion of a new platform of
technology services, the IPTV. The implementation
focus will reside in the network provider core, that is,
in the aggregation networks of IPTV architecture.

The work methodology was achieved in distinct
and successive steps. The first step consisted in
requirements and parameters collection directly with
the responsible for the technical IT infrastructure
management (Information Technology) and for do
Service Level Agreement (SLA) management with
service provider. Among these requirements, it is the
topology used by the company to provide the
backbone (transport network) link, Fig. 2, the
bandwidth used in the main links, MPLS cloud
location and the traffic that is more used in the total
load of the network passing bandwidth.

After this step, it was elaborated the topology
taking into account all collected parameters to be made
then an analysis of its current behavior. It will be based
on the edge routers that connect the backbone of the
towns of Vitória and São Luís. This was made through
scripts (.tcl) implementations, which serve as an input in
the Network Simulator 2 (NS2, simulator widely used in
the academia, based on discrete events) tool, where it
will compiled and generated execution logs and packets
behavior representative data files over the time called
trace (.tr) files. The input .tcl files will have all

Analyses

configurations related to the traffic most used by the
network including the IPTV traffic.
The Fig. 3 presents the topology created in the
simulation too capable to reproduce the service provider.
The MPLS cloud is represented by the routers in
hexagonal format, where the labels are inserted in
packets located in the router 2 input and removed at
the end of the communication in the recipient (router
8). It is possible to verify the queue of different kinds
of traffic in the router from the town of São Luís
toward Vitória, passing through the way or “tunnel”
of Label-Switched Path (LSP) network resources,
formed by the routers 4, 5 and 7.
The log file generated by the simulator has a data
matrix structure that records the network events and
behavior every half a second or up to milliseconds.
The simulation maximum duration time was sixty (60)
seconds. This file is analyzed and processed by
another application called tracegraph and NS2
Analyzer, specific for plotting the statistical graphics
and results with different variables. These graphics
are plotted through the insertion and reading of the
entire .tr file generated, allowing filtering about the
requirements to be analyzed.
One advantage of using the NS2 simulator is the
utilization of discrete events, that is, the possibility to
analyze the network behavior in a certain predefined
period of time with insertions of variables over the
interval. It becomes the closest simulation of reality
due to its dynamics and power of temporal record.
Specifically, through the generation of plotted graphics
and statistical data, it will be interpreted the values
referring to the throughput, delay, jitter and packet loss,
making an analysis of each IPTV stream inserted in the
network. With these results obtained, it will be
possible to say the limit of streams number that that
the network has the ability to withstand. This can be
concluded from the comparison made between the
statistical data obtained and the values fixed in the DSL
Forum Technical Report TR-126 recommendations, about
the QoS requirements for IPTV services.

Before the table presented above, we can first say
that an analyzed corporate network has a tolerance and
ability to process up to 03 (three) IPTV streams,
ensuring the minimum requirement to obtain a good
quality transmission. After the insertion of 04 (four) IPTV
streams in the current network of the corporate company,
there will be a natural competition with other applications
so that it will happen degradation in the transmission of
these IPTV packets and possibly a discrepancy in video
transmission quality, in spite of being within the interval
recommended for a satisfactory quality.
After this quantity inserted, it is noticeable that, from
the instance of 05 (five) IPTV streams, there is a
significant IPTV packets loss percentage, eliminating
any investment for this number of connections.
The Fig. 4 describes an exponential curve of IPTV
packets loss along the injection of new streams up to the
maximum insertion of 07 (seven) streams. It can be noticed
that the loss does not follow a standard or a standard
numerical series among them, leaving random the
percentage according to the kind of concurrent application.
The competition among the applications inserted in
the corporate network will be a key point to take a
measure of a more robust investment from the viewpoint
of prioritizing some of them. Through the Fig. 5 and 6, it
is evident that the IPTV traffic competes highly with
other applications of conventional data, represented by
TCP protocol streams.
The graphic presents the throughput of IPTV and
TCP applications packets. This graphic makes reference
to the insertion of only one IPTV stream, where it can be
noticed that the competition has become evident yet for
this instance and the occupation of the bandwidth
follows in distinct tracks, what facilitates the nondegradation of the packets of each application.
Whereas in Fig. 6, the perception of this competition
is already more evident, that is, in the limit instance for a
quality of satisfactory transmission of the network, the
bandwidth competition for the IPTV packets with the
general data packets becomes more fierce, causes a
degradation for the services and occupies the limits of
transmission tracks.
With the insertion of the last instance of 07 (seven)
streams of IPTV applications, there is a farther
degradation of TCP packets throughput, including being
exceeded in the flow of sending (Fig. 7).
With the increase in the network occupation to the
detriment of the TCP packets, the applications to which
the company was already operating in a satisfactory way
before its clients may suffer losses of availability,
instability and even data inconsistencies. On the other
hand, a new IPTV technology can ensure greater
productive returns from the point of view of
technological possibilities increasing.

Results
The results were obtained from the trace files
processing generated by the NS2 simulation tool. At
each instance for a new IPTV traffic stream, it was
made a processing for QoS requirements calculation
along with its respective associated graphics.
The Table 2 shows the results grid for each
instance of IPTV stream inserted in the network,
associated with the corresponding QoS requirement.
All the values collected and showed in the table refer
to the specific packets of IPTV applications streams that
were analyzed along with other kinds of packets coming
from other applications fighting for the pass band.

After the data collected and analyses made from
these metrics, it can be conclude that, obeying the
company current setting, it is viable the insertion of this
new technology and platform. However, it is important
to note that there is a very apparent limitation in the
scalability of these streams. If there is a need of
increasing the number of IPTV applications, fatally an

Conclusion
The work proposed had the finality to verify the
viability or not of IPTV traffic insertion in the corporate
network which could meet live television broadcast, in a
satisfactory way and without significant losses of other
applications already existing in the logical data network.

investment will be necessary in the local infrastructure
and in the backbone of this network. Besides, other
Quality of Service strategies will be required to cover the
new packet transmission needs.
Therefore, the work of research and previous
simulations has a very great importance before the
operation of these services. Furthermore, it will be
necessary a cost/benefit study de implementation before
the third-party company that provides the logical
network backbone through a specific SLA.
Finally, television broadcast through data network
has become a reality in the vast majority of large
companies to support several business areas. It means
that there will be real possibilities to bring even closer
the managers and the operational areas, once possibilities
of innovative technologies will be open as, for example,
the IPTV applications in smartphones (mobile telephone
with advanced functionalities). Consequently, the
implementation viability of this platform in the company
not only opens a wide range of possibilities of new
services but also will put the company in a prominent
level of innovation and digital inclusion.
