Abstract
This tutorial presents an introduction to the interaction of light and matter on the attosecond
timescale. Our aim is to detail the theoretical description of ultra-short time delays and to
relate these to the phase of extreme ultraviolet (XUV) light pulses and to the asymptotic
phaseshifts of photoelectron wave packets. Special emphasis is laid on time-delay
experiments, where attosecond XUV pulses are used to photoionize target atoms at
well-defined times, followed by a probing process in real time by a phase-locked, infrared
laser field. In this way, the laser field serves as a ‘clock’ to monitor the ionization event, but the
observable delays do not correspond directly to the delay associated with single-photon
ionization. Instead, a significant part of the observed delay originates from a measurement
induced process, which obscures the single-photon ionization dynamics. This artefact is traced
back to a phaseshift of the above-threshold ionization transition matrix element, which we call
the continuum–continuum phase. It arises due to the laser-stimulated transitions between
Coulomb continuum states. As we shall show here, these measurement-induced effects can be
separated from the single-photon ionization process, using analytical expressions of universal
character, so that eventually the attosecond time delays in photoionization can be accessed.

1. Introduction

(a)

Great advances in experimental physics are being made using
attosecond pulses of XUV radiation, where it is now possible
to initiate, control and probe electron dynamics in atoms and
molecules in real time. A natural and perhaps na¨ıve question
then arises: is it possible to use attosecond pulses to measure
the time it takes for a photoelectron to be ionized? It is
well known from fundamental principles in quantum theory
that time is not a direct observable quantity [1]. Here, our
aim is to discuss what temporal aspects of photoionization
can be measured in state-of-the-art experiments based on
attosecond XUV pulses and phase-locked IR probe fields. This
tutorial serves as an introduction to the theoretical description
of radiative processes taking place in extremely short time
intervals, with durations comparable to the temporal response
of outer-shell bound electrons within atoms or molecules. An
interesting point is that the theoretical background provides a
common framework for XUV pulses that propagate through
dispersive media and for non-relativistic photoelectron wave
packets that escape from the atomic potential. We wish to
stress the similarities and differences between these two types
of wave packets and to discuss the associated light–matter
interactions occurring in the attosecond timescale. To this end,
we shall derive the way in which small perturbations in the
medium affect the propagation of the light pulses and we will
detail the present ways of probing photoionization of neutral
species in real time. In doing this, special attention must be
paid to the case of long-range Coulomb potentials, which are
important for describing electron motion in photoionization.
The theoretical methods used here span different disciplines
ranging from ultra-fast optics and nonlinear optics to scattering
theory, atomic physics and strong-field physics.

1.1. Overview of attosecond physics
This section provides an ‘ultra-short’ overview of the historical
development and of the key concepts in attosecond physics.
HHG, APT and SAP will be introduced. We refer the
unfamiliar reader to [2–5] for more comprehensive reviews
of attosecond physics.
1.1.1. High-order harmonic generation. The work on
attosecond light pulses stems from a process discovered in the
late 1980s called HHG [6, 7]. It was found that a broad plateau
in the XUV range, containing a comb of almost equally strong,
odd harmonics, could be produced by focusing an intense ultrashort IR laser pulse into a target of noble gas. A sketch of a
typical HHG experiment is shown in figure 1(a), where first
an intense IR field interacts with a target of Ar gas to generate
high-order harmonics, and then these harmonics propagate to
a different chamber where they photoionize Ar atoms so that
photoelectrons are emitted.
With a titanium:sapphire laser system (photon energy of
ω = 1.55 eV, corresponding to a near-IR laser wavelength
of λ = 800 nm) using chirped-pulse amplification [8], the
typical laser intensity used for HHG is IL ∼ 1014 W cm−2 .
Harmonic conversion efficiencies as high as 10−6 and photon
energies in the soft x-ray range have been obtained [9–14].
Neither the broad comb of high-order harmonics, nor their
high conversion efficiency can be explained using standard
theoretical tools of nonlinear optics, where the laser field is
treated as a perturbation [15]. In the perturbative formalism,
an increase in harmonic order N is always accompanied by
a strong reduction in conversion efficiency as is evident from

Outline of the tutorial
The content of this tutorial is divided into seven sections. In
section 1, we introduce unfamiliar readers to ‘attophysics’
and we present a short overview of the high-order harmonic
generation process which is used to generate attosecond
XUV pulses. In section 2, we review the role of the
spectral phase for the propagation of XUV wave packets.
Here, we use the so-called group delay to describe the
coherent superposition of monochromatic waves in the time
domain. Similarly, in section 3, we investigate the intrinsic
phase of photoelectrons and the corresponding time delay of
electron wave packets with special attention to the long-range
Coulomb potential. In section 4, we perform time-dependent
perturbation calculations for the creation and propagation
of photoelectron wave packets generated by an attosecond
XUV pulse. In section 5, we review the influence of the
laser-probe field by performing time-dependent perturbation
calculations to second order in the interaction with the
light fields. In section 6, we discuss the state-of-the-art
experimental effort to measure attosecond time delays in laserassisted photoionization. Finally, in section 7, we present our
conclusions and outlook.

the well-known nonlinear conversion formula: IN ∝ ILN , where
1 is the intensity of the laser in a scaled set of variables.
IL
As an example, the relevant intensity scale for laser–atom
interactions is the so-called atomic unit of intensity: Iat =
3.5 × 1016 W cm−2 . As mentioned above, optimal conditions
to observe HHG processes are obtained with titanium:sapphire
laser devices operated at IL ≈ 1014 W cm−2 , so that in scaled
10−2 . In direct contrast with such perturbative

A cut-off law for the maximal photon energy in the HHG
plateau was found numerically to be [16]

≈ Ip + 3Up ,

corresponding to electrons with quasi-classical (complex)
trajectories [24, 25], which are closely related to Feynman’s
path integral approach to quantum mechanics [26]. This
semi-classical model explained why the harmonics were
of comparable strength, but it also revealed that several
semi-classical trajectories contribute to the emission of each
harmonic. This finding implied that each harmonic was emitted
in two bursts per half-cycle of the laser, thus leading to a
complicated temporal structure of the harmonic emission. It
has been shown, as reviewed in [27], that the problem of these
multiple emission times can be circumvented experimentally
thanks to the phase-matching properties of the macroscopic
medium, leading to a ‘selection’ of the emission from the
shortest family of electron trajectories.
Also, it was soon understood that such frequency combs
of high-order harmonics would correspond to light with pulse
durations in the attosecond timescale, i.e. shorter than any
light pulses ever produced, under some restrictive conditions
regarding their relative phases [28, 29]. The generation of such
‘attosecond pulses’ is a challenging task especially because the
experimentalists have to find a way of manipulating the relative
phase of the harmonics over the large spectral bandwidth
of the comb [30]. Another major challenge was to devise a
scheme to measure the duration of the pulses. This was because
existing methods used in traditional ultra-fast optics could not
be directly applied due to the short wavelength and relatively
low intensity of the harmonics.

is the so-called ponderomotive energy of the electron in the
laser field [17]. The latter energy is associated with the average
oscillatory (quiver) motion of a free-electron driven by a
single-frequency field. Using equations (1) and (2) in the
Ip , the cut-off increases quadratically for longer
limit Up

laser wavelengths,
max ∝ λ , and linearly with the laser
intensity,
max ∝ IL . This scaling has been used to increase
the harmonic photon energies into the keV regime using laser
fields with longer wavelengths (mid-IR wavelengths) [18–21].
Although HHG spectra from simple systems could be
reproduced by numerical simulations based on the resolution
of the TDSE [16], a convenient scenario to explain the
mechanism of the process is based on the so-called three-step
model [22]. The three steps are illustrated in figure 2.
A more detailed quantum mechanical theory for HHG was
published in [23], showing that the three-step model could be
derived from the Schr¨odinger equation using the SFA. In this
way, a more exact cut-off law was derived analytically:

1.1.2. Attosecond pulses. In 2001, more than a decade after
the first HHG process was observed, the first APT were
characterized using a scheme called RABITT [31–33]. As
measured in a set of experiments, the attosecond pulse duration
was ∼250 as = 250×10−18 s, corresponding to ∼1/10 of the
laser period and to ∼1/100 of the laser pulse duration used for
HHG. Two attosecond pulses were produced per oscillation of
the laser field, resulting in a train of ∼30 pulses in the total
APT. A typical fraction of an APT is depicted in figure 3.

Figure 3. Attosecond pulse train. The attosecond pulse (shaded grey) duration is a fraction of the fundamental laser period (red dashed
curve). The pulse separation is a half laser period and the sign of the attosecond electric field (heavy black curve) changes from pulse to
pulse.

Making the IR pulse shorter leads naturally to fewer
attosecond pulses. It was soon demonstrated that a SAP could
be generated using a few-cycle IR pulse, ∼5 fs [34]. The basic
properties of the SAP can be determined using the attosecond
streak camera [35], while more complete characterization
requires the use of the sophisticated FROG–CRAB scheme
[36]. For such short IR pulses, the CEP is an important
parameter that must be controlled. For instance, the generation
of a SAP can be changed into the generation of two attosecond
pulses by carefully tuning the CEP of the laser field [37, 38].
One of the most impressive applications of SAP was the ‘direct
measurement of light waves’ [39], where the SAP was used to
map out the oscillating vector potential of a few-cycle optical
laser pulse. Another useful way of controlling the HHG process
is called ‘polarization gating’ [40–43], which relies on the
dependence of laser polarization for the yield of HHG. In
simple terms, linear polarization implies that the gate is open
because attosecond pulses are being produced, while elliptical
polarization suppresses the HHG and closes the gate.
From a more fundamental standpoint, attosecond pulses
are interesting because they are shorter than any pulses created
by conventional optical lasers. Physically, we understand
this because the duration of a light pulse cannot be shorter
than its own period. Optical lasers, corresponding to visible
and IR wavelengths, have a period that is longer than 1 fs,
leading to the so-called femtosecond barrier for ultra-short
pulses. The power needed to drive a laser scales strongly with
the photon frequency, P ∝ ω5 , which effectively prevents
the conventional laser scheme from going beyond optical
wavelengths [19]. More formally, a pulse intensity envelope
has a minimal duration proportional to the inverse of the
supporting coherent bandwidth:

to compare the bandwidth of the laser used for HHG with the
bandwidth of the attosecond pulses being generated. An IR
laser pulse used for generation of an APT has a typical duration
of 30 fs and a bandwidth of 60 meV; while the corresponding
attosecond pulses are 100 as with a bandwidth of 15 eV. During
the HHG process, the coherent bandwidth is increased by a
factor of 250 from laser to high-order harmonics.
Attosecond pulses can be used to ionize atoms and
molecules at extremely well-defined times, but how do the
resulting photoelectron wave packets and holes behave after
the ionization event? How can the attosecond pulses be
used to obtain temporal information about physical processes
occurring in the atomic timescale? Using attosecond pulses
to ionize target atoms or molecules does not by itself
provide any high-resolution temporal information! When the
photoelectrons are collected in an experiment, we can only
determine the value of the momentum (or energy) that they
have gained in the course of the process, but not how or
when it was acquired. This implies that the temporal ionization
events must be synchronized and probed with the help of an
external ‘clock’ that ‘ticks’ itself in the attosecond timescale.
The typical period of light in the optical regime is in the
femtosecond timescale, but one can argue that its variation
occurs in the sub-femtosecond regime, which then justifies
its common usage as a probe in attosecond photoionization
experiments. In this way, it is possible to use a fairly long
laser pulse, say tens of femtoseconds, to monitor attosecond
photoionization events. Clearly, it is important that the probe
field is phase locked with the attosecond pulses, a requirement
which is easily satisfied in HHG experiments by using fractions
of the same laser pulse for both creating the attosecond pulses
and for probing the photoionization process. Using attosecond
pulses with phase-locked laser probes has led to a range
of experiments where time delays between photoelectrons
from different configurations and systems have been measured
[44–46]. Then, the natural question that emerges is whether
or not such attosecond experiments yield direct access to the
delay in photoemission, i.e. to the time it takes for an electron to
photoionize, or if the observed delays should be interpreted in
a different way? Before answering these questions, we briefly
review different pump–probe schemes that have been used to
experimentally study light–matter interactions in real time.

the intensity envelope. The minimal pulse duration, called the
Fourier-limited pulse duration, occurs when all the spectral
components are compressed, i.e. when the spectral phase is
perfectly linear. The attosecond pulses produced through HHG
can overcome the femtosecond barrier not only because they
have a much shorter wavelength than optical light, but also
because they have a broad coherent bandwidth. It is interesting

the intuitive interpretation of these experiments is limited by
the respective pulse durations. Using few-cycle optical-laser
fields to pump and probe the system is adequate to study
nuclear motion in molecular systems, typically occurring in
the femtosecond timescale. Coherent, attosecond XUV pump–
probe experiments, where attosecond pulses are used for both
pumping and probing, hold promise of observing the electron
dynamics in the attosecond timescale, but they are difficult
to implement experimentally due to the low probability for
absorbing two photons in the XUV range, where we assume
that at least one photon must be absorbed from both the
pump and the probe for a meaningful signal. We refer the
reader to [51] (and the references therein) for the state-ofthe-art experimental effort on XUV-pump and XUV-probe
experiments bordering the attosecond timescale. A different
kind of pump–probe experiment has been carried out using a
SAP as the pump and a few-cycle laser pulse as the probe, see,
e.g., [52], where the Fourier transform of the delay-dependent
spectrogram yields quantum beats, but also the interference
between direct and indirect pathways in the ionization.

1.2.2. Simultaneous pump–probe experiment using SAP:
‘streaking’. A more commonly used attosecond pump–
probe configuration is illustrated in figure 4(b), where the
pump and probe pulses overlap in time. In this situation,
it is not primarily the field-free system that is of interest,
but rather the temporal characterization of the pulses or the
evolution of the system in the presence of the two fields. The
pump pulse is an attosecond XUV pulse, while the probe
pulse is a longer (few femtosecond) IR-laser pulse. Strictly
speaking, this is a laser-assisted photoionization process,
where the system is simultaneously pumped and probed.
Sub-femtosecond temporal information can be gained by
repeating the experiment at different subcycle delays between
the attosecond pump pulse and the laser field oscillation of
the probe pulse. Clearly, it is essential that the two pulses
are phase locked and that the delay can be controlled with
sub-femtosecond precision.
Under these conditions, the system can absorb energy
simultaneously from the two fields, i.e. while it absorbs one
XUV photon, it is ‘dressed’ by the relatively intense IR probe
field. Accordingly, a non-perturbative approach is needed to
account for the effect of the probe. A simplified theory for
the influence of the probe pulse on the photoelectrons is
given by the streak-camera formalism [35]. This simplified
interpretation of the photoelectron distribution relies on
the use of the SFA, which is equivalent to assuming that
the photoelectron feels the instantaneous laser field, while the
Coulomb potential of the ionic core is neglected. According to
the SFA, the streaked electron-momentum distribution is then
shifted as

attosecond XUV pulse envelope and the broader red area represents
the one of the probing laser pulse, while the dotted red lines indicate
the corresponding E-field.

1.2. Pump–probe schemes for ultra-fast measurements
In this tutorial, we provide a theoretical background for the
temporal aspects of photoionization. The attosecond pulse
structure is shorter than the response time of any detector
or electronic device, but it is possible to obtain temporal
information about attosecond photoionization indirectly
by investigating coherent cross-correlation photoelectron
spectrograms between the attosecond pulse and a weak IR
laser probe. In figure 4, we present three different kinds of
cross-correlation techniques.
1.2.1. Traditional pump–probe experiment. A typical pump–
probe scheme is illustrated in figure 4(a). First, a pump pulse
is used to excite the system at time t = 0. A part of the
quantum mechanical wavefunction is then pumped from the
initial state to an excited wave packet: (0) (0) → (1) (0).
The system can then evolve in a field-free environment until
time t = τ , when the probe pulse interacts with the excited
wave packet, thus changing its state: (1) (τ ) → (2) (τ ).
In experiments, the modification of the wave packet leads
to the change of the observable quantities as a function of
the delay between the pump and the probe pulses. Temporal
information about the field-free propagation of the system,
e.g., a molecular vibration, can then be extracted in real time by
repeating the experiment systematically for different delays of
the probe pulse. In this way, the intermediate steps in chemical
reactions, the so-called transition states, have been investigated
in the framework of Zewail’s femtochemistry [47–50]. Clearly,

p f (τ ) = p0 − eA(τ ),

(5)

where p0 is the unshifted, probe-free momentum, e > 0 is the
elementary charge and A(τ ) is the probe-field vector potential
at the time of ionization. This concept of ‘instantaneous
streaking’ provides a simple map from time to momentum
of the streaked electrons, which is valid assuming that the

electron is free shortly after the ionization event, i.e. that it
either escapes from a short-range binding potential or is ejected
with a high velocity. In practice, the electron is not completely
free after the ionization event due to the remaining Coulomb
potential from the ion. Smirnova and co-workers found that the
simultaneous action of the long-range Coulomb potential and
the probing laser field can result in a small shift of the streaking
process [53], i.e. an uncertainty on the absolute delay in the
experiment. Until recently [45], these delays were considered
too small to be accessible in streaking experiments. The highlevel of accuracy that is required for attophysics remains a
challenge to theory, especially in the non-perturbative regime.

The advantages of the periodic time-structure of APT are
rather practical: first, it is less demanding experimentally to
produce APT and multi-cycle probe-fields, than SAP and fewcycle probe fields. Second, the probe field can be weaker than
for streaking, thereby, causing less side-effects on the system,
e.g. induced polarization of the core or ionization. Third,
the signal is read out on zero-background, i.e. in energetic
regions where no initial photoelectrons appear. Finally, a
monochromatic probe field simplifies the analysis because it
leads to less spectral convolutions in the experimental signal,
as we shall discuss further in section 5.
In this setup, there is a phase-difference associated with
the instantaneous probing by the laser field, which can be
traced back to the phaseshift of the relevant two-photon matrix
elements. The probability of the sideband (SB) peak modulates
as

1.2.3. Instantaneous pump–probe experiment using APT:
‘RABITT’. In figure 4(c), a train of ‘identical’ attosecond
pump pulses are probed with a monochromatic IR-field. This
scheme is often referred to as the RABITT method [31–33].
Provided that the probe pulses are weak and that the fields are
repeated periodically for many cycles, this scheme can provide
equivalent information as the streak-camera method described
above (figure 4(b)). We will discuss this equivalence in more
detail in section 5 in terms of photoelectron wave packets,
and we suggest that the interested reader should consult [54]
for a complete derivation in lowest-order perturbation theory.
Higher-order effects in the probe field have previously been
considered using the soft-photon approximation; see, e.g., [55].
In section 5.3, we will also discuss higher order probe-photon
processes and explain why these do not significantly alter the
phases and delays in laser-assisted photoionization.
The shared periodicity of the APT and the probe field
implies that the photoelectrons will appear on distinct energies
corresponding to the discrete numbers of absorbed photons.
In figure 5, we display a typical experimental photoelectron
spectrogram produced by laser-assisted APT ionizing Ar gas.

where φ2q = (φ2q+1 −φ2q−1 ) is the phase difference between
the consecutive harmonics (2q + 1)ω and (2q − 1)ω; θ2q
is an intrinsic atomic quantity, the so-called atomic phase,
associated with the difference of the phases of the transition
amplitudes associated with the distinct quantum paths leading
to the SB [32, 33]. The former phase is related to the arrival
time of the attosecond pulses τφ = φ2q /(2ω), for frequencies
≈ 2qω. The atomic phases were studied in detail by Toma
and Muller already in 2002, using lowest order perturbation
theory, for photoionization from the 3p state in argon [57].
Further numerical work was performed by Mauritsson et al
using SAE effective potentials for helium, neon and argon
[58]. The latter two numerical calculations were made with
the intention of making calibration curves for attosecond
characterization tools, such as RABITT. Our aim in this tutorial
is to discuss the origin of this atomic phase in detail. We will
identify its fundamental physical components in terms of time

delays and we will relate it to the above-mentioned streaking
delays.

2.1. Phase propagation of light in the linear regime
In order to describe the propagation of linearly polarized,
attosecond light pulses in a medium, we insert the ansatz
E(ω, r) ∝ exp [iφ(ω, x)] zˆ into equation (7) to obtain a
differential equation for the phase of monochromatic waves:

2. Attosecond pulses of light
It is well known that short light pulses can be described as wave
packets, i.e. as coherent superpositions of monochromatic light
waves [59]. The propagation of such wave packets can then
be understood in terms of the phaseshifts of the individual
monochromatic waves, which will be discussed in section 2.1.
An attosecond XUV pulse can be strongly stretched in time by
the propagation through a dispersive medium, but conversely,
it is also possible to compress a stretched pulse using a medium
with negative (anomalous) dispersion. A useful theoretical tool
adapted to describe these phenomena is the so-called stationary
phase approximation (SPA), which is introduced in section 2.2
and applied to the propagation of attosecond pulses. As we
will show later, it applies equally well to the propagation of
photoelectron wave packets.
We start our analysis of attosecond XUV pulses from
the Maxwell equations in a dielectric medium [15, 59] and
recast the wave equation into a time-independent form by
exploiting the orthogonality of the Fourier integral expansions
of the time-dependent fields:

|x|. Thus, a frequency-independent refractive index leads to a
linear phaseshift in frequency. This linear phaseshift causes
a simple time delay, τ = δ/ω, of the attosecond pulse in
equation (8),

compared to free-space propagation, corresponding to the
undistorted waves Efree (ω, x). Equation (15) is a direct
application of the well-known shift-theorem of Fourier
transforms. Furthermore, if the medium is absorbing, the
asymptotic phase will be a complex quantity, with its real
part leading to the actual phaseshift and its imaginary part
leading to an exponential reduction of the amplitude, exp[iδ] =
exp[i (δ)] exp[− (δ)].

Here, the fields in space–frequency are written without a tilde:

Strictly speaking, the medium may exhibit a more complicated
evolution in time, e.g., due to ionization of the species
constituting the medium or due to nonlinear polarization, but
we will not consider the latter effects here [15, 60], due to the
fact that the interaction between pulses with moderate intensity
in the XUV range and matter are typically perturbative.
We mention, however, that such contribution may become
important when studying the propagation of intense XUV or
x-ray radiation pulses, such as the ones generated by XFEL
facilities, with peak intensities well above the atomic unit of
intensity, i.e. in the range beyond 1016 W cm−2 .

which implies that the phase velocity, i.e. vphase = c/n(ω, x),
of the monochromatic field is faster than c (superluminal),

which shows that any light pulse is delayed by the plasma
and that it travels at a speed less than c. These effects prove
to be practical for phase matching of nonlinear processes,
where control of the superluminal phase velocity is achieved
by simply increasing or decreasing the intensity of the laser
field. This is because it indirectly alters the density of the
plasma due to a changing ionization rate, which affects in turn
the electron density in the plasma.

2.1.1. Dispersion and group delays. So far we have assumed
that the linear response is independent of the frequency of
the light. This is an adequate approximation for narrowbandwidth laser pulses, but it is not a good approximation for
attosecond pulses that have a large spectral bandwidth [60]. In
a more realistic model, the material will be dispersive, i.e. the
refractive index will be frequency dependent, n(ω, x) [61–63].
After passing such a material, the asymptotic (spectral) phase
δ(ω) may exhibit a nonlinear frequency dependence, which
implies that the wave packet in the time domain,

2.1.2. Attosecond pulse trains. Our discussion of delays is
very general and it clearly applies to the propagation of many
kinds of light pulses, including both SAP and APT. APT arise
naturally from the HHG process when the driving laser field is
many periods long. The train contains two identical attosecond
pulses per period of the fundamental field, with electric
fields having opposite signs. In this context, uncompensated
dispersion will lead to a temporal overlap and interference
between consecutive attosecond pulses in the APT, when the
individual pulse duration increases beyond a half-period of
the fundamental laser field. An ideal APT can be written as a
Fourier sum, i.e. as a discrete version of equation (8), over all
high-order harmonics
˜ )=

around the central frequency of the pulse ω0 . In many practical
cases, it is sufficient to consider the first few terms in this
expansion. Note that we have already seen that the zero-order
term determines the overall phase of the pulse and that the firstorder term determines the delay of the pulse. In the optical
regime, most materials have a positive (normal) dispersion,
which means that the refractive index increases as a function
of frequency. This implies longer delays for higher frequency
pulses passing through the same medium. Close to resonances
or close to the ionization threshold of a material, the refractive
index may have a negative (anomalous) dispersion. The GD is
defined as
∂δ
,
(20)
τGD (ω) =
∂ω
and it represents a direct generalization of the shift theorem in
equation (15), stating that the derivative of the spectral phase at
any frequency ω corresponds to a delay in the propagation of
the components of the wave packet in that spectral region. The
GD is a rather abstract concept, but a useful interpretation
is that it can be related to the time when the coherent
superposition of all wave packets in the neighbourhood of
ω is constructive. The GD is not equal to the time when the
˜ )] equals ω for a
instantaneous temporal frequency ∂t∂ arg[E(t
wave packet in general. However, we show in section 2.2 that
the GD does equal the time of this instantaneous frequency for
wave packets that are stretched in the time domain.
In order to illustrate the GD concept, we now consider an
XUV wave packet after travelling through a plasma of length
L, where
n p (ω) =

where 2q + 1 labels the odd harmonics that are generated from
HHG. We write ‘ideal’ to indicate that the APT in equation (24)
corresponds to an infinite number of pulses in the time domain,
while an actual APT will have a finite duration comparable to
that of the fundamental IR laser pulse [65, 66]. A short APT is
likely to exhibit strong pulse-to-pulse variations. The subcycle
behaviour of the ideal APT can, however, be understood as an
average subcycle pulse structure in a long APT composed of
many attosecond pulses.
2.1.3. Compression of attosecond pulses using metallic foils.
As a general rule, attosecond pulses are generated with a
positive intrinsic chirp from the HHG process [24]. However,
they can be compressed in time using thin metallic foils in the
setup depicted in figure 1(a) [67–69]. An example of such XUV
pulse compression is shown in figure 6, where the experimental
data correspond to propagation through a 400 nm thin Al foil.
The Al foil provides negative dispersion in the low-energy
part of the transmission window, while the high-energy part
provides positive dispersion. In experiments, this property of
Al foils is used to generate close to Fourier-limited attosecond
pulses by compensating for the intrinsic positive chirp of
the HHG process by the negative dispersion provided by
the low-energy part of the metallic transmission window.
Note the structure of the APT, with two pulses per period of
the fundamental laser field. We mention again that the electric
field of the two adjacent pulses have opposite phases, i.e. they
are π -shifted.

do not contribute significantly. In the vicinity of a complex
saddle point z0 , where f (z0 ) = 0, the complex function can
be expanded as

2.2. Stationary phase approximation
The SPA is an essential theoretical tool in attophysics because
it can be used to evaluate integrals with complex-valued
integrands, such as the ones encountered when computing
time–frequency Fourier transforms. It has proven itself
especially successful for understanding the HHG process
[23, 24], and it remains a useful tool for gaining better
understanding of strong-field dynamics; see, e.g., [70–72]. In
sections 2.2.3 and 2.2.4, we will apply the SPA to evaluate
XUV wave packets. Furthermore, in section 4.4, we will apply
the SPA to the propagation of electron wave packets ionized
by attosecond pulses.
In simple terms, the SPA is related to the well-known
integral of a Gaussian [73]

where the integral runs over the real parameter ρ, but
the integrand remains complex. Using equation (29), it is,
however, simple to choose an angle for the contour so that the
exponent becomes negative and real, 2ϕ + arg[ f (z0 )] = π ,
which turns the integrand into a simple real Gaussian with
β = | f (z0 )|/2 in analogy with equation (25). A technical
point is that we must have −π /2 < ϕ < π /2 for the
contour to run in the ‘right’ direction, i.e. with the real part
of z increasing, but this is typically the case in physical

2.2.1. Method of steepest descent. In more detail, the SPA
belongs to a class of techniques of wide use to compute
integrals with integrands containing the exponential of a
complex analytical function: f (z) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y), with
z = x + iy. It is closely related to the so-called steepest descent
method, which deals with integrals of the following form [73]:
dz exp[ f (z)],

1
dz exp f (z0 ) + (z − z0 )2 f (z0 ) ,

C

where the zeroth-order f (z0 ) and the second-order f (z0 )
coefficients are complex. In order to evaluate this integral,
we parametrize the contour: z(ρ) = z0 + ρeiϕ , with ρ being
a real parameter and ϕ the angle at which the contour crosses
the saddle point at z0 in the complex plane. After this change
of variable, we obtain

which has a finite value provided that β > 0. As an example,
we plot the integrand and integral for β = 1 in figures 7(a) and
(b),
√ respectively. The integral value in figure 7(b) approaches
π ≈ 1.7725 as expected from equation (25).

It is now of interest to compare the simple integration
of a Gaussian, equation (25), with the result of our complex
analysis, equation (30), and conclude that the integrand
in equation (25) may be complex. The integral converges
provided that (β ) > 0, but also in the special case of
(β ) = 0, provided that (β ) = 0. In the latter case, the
convergence can be understood as being due to rapid complex
oscillations for large values of |ω| as shown in figure 7(c),

to a finite complex integrated value in figure 7(d) of

(32)
∂ω
where the roots ωs are labelled by the index s. The number
of solutions depends on the properties of the phase factor
f (ω). In the simplest cases, which we will consider here, there
is only one solution. The SPA is derived assuming that the
second-order term is dominant as compared to higher order
phase terms, e.g., (ω − ωs )2 fs /2
(ω − ωs )3 fs /6, in the
neighbourhood of each saddle point, |ω − ωs | < π . If the
second-order phase term happens to be zero, i.e. fs /2 =
β = 0, this would correspond to an artificial divergence in
equation (31). This divergence is most likely non-physical (this
may occur close to the cut-off in the HHG) and the result would
be finite if the third-order phase term in the Taylor expansion
of the exponent was used in the integral. Having derived the
SPA, equation (31), we now need to demonstrate that it can
help us to make physical arguments about the propagation of
XUV wave packets.

2.2.2. General equation for SPA. Inspired by the above
results, we now consider a typical frequency domain integral
of a more general function: E(ω) exp(i f (ω)), where E(ω) is
a smooth amplitude function and f (ω) is a smooth phase
function. The phase function may contain several saddle
points, also called ‘stationary’ points. In regions where f (ω)
is varying fast, we expect the contribution to the integral to
be small in analogy with figures 7(c) and (d). Conversely,
we expect significant contributions from regions close to the
stationary frequency ωs , where the first derivative of the phase
function vanishes: ∂ f /∂ω|ωs ≡ f (ωs ) ≡ fs = 0. Then, using
the truncated Taylor expansion in equation (27) in the vicinity

2.2.3. Stretched XUV wave packets. It is well known from
ultra-fast optics that uncompensated dispersion can lead to
stretched pulses in the time domain [8]. It is illustrative to use
the SPA to calculate the properties of such stretched pulses.

g ≈ |δ0 |/2. Then, for the SPA to be meaningful, the Gaussian
envelope must be included in the phase factor so that it becomes
complex:

Consider an attosecond pulse, as expressed in equation (18),
at x = 0, with a rather broad Gaussian envelope
E(ω) = E0 exp − g(ω − ω0 )2 ,

(33)

and with a phase factor f (ω) = −ωt+δ(ω), where the spectral
phase is
δ(ω) ≈ δ0 + (ω − ω0 )δ0 + 12 (ω − ω0 )2 δ0 ,

f (ω) = δ(ω) − ωt + ig(ω − ω0 )2 .

Using the asymptotic phase to second order, equation (34), the
stationary-phase equation (see equation (32)) remains firstorder, with complex and time-dependent coefficients

(34)

g. The SPA expressed in
with a large quadratic chirp, |δ0 |/2
equation (31) then implies that the magnitude of the amplitude
factor will be dominated by the contribution of a local value,
Es = E0 exp[−g(ωs − ω0 )2 ], occurring at the stationary
frequency ωs as determined by solving equation (32). This
is quite similar to the way in which a delta function operates,
selecting a specific value of a function. Here, it arises from the
small constructive window in the complex integral that occurs
around the stationary frequency.
The next task is to find the stationary frequency ωs ,
which can be seen as the frequency that makes the dominant
contribution to the wave packet in a given point in space–time.
The stationary-phase equation (see equation (32)) becomes
first order f (ω) ≈ δ0 + (ω − ω0 )δ0 − t = 0, which we use to
find the stationary frequency for a given time t:
1
t − δ0 .

(40)

We mention that it is common to obtain complex stationary
points in the SPA in the case of steep variations of the spectral
amplitude.
The real part of ωs is identified as the instantaneous
frequency, as was done in section 2.2.3; while the imaginary
part of ωs limits the intensity duration (or probability
distribution) of the attosecond pulse in time. At the origin,
x = 0, the intensity of the attosecond pulse will be large only
at a time t close to the group delay: t ≈ δ0 , where the imaginary
part of the stationary frequency vanishes. Inserting ωs (t ) into
the right-hand side of equation (31) yields the result

We can rewrite equation (35) to see that, due to the chirp
induced from propagation, any frequency of the pulse, ω =
ωs (t ), ‘arrives’ at a unique time, t = δ0 + [ωs − ω0 ]δ0 ≈ δs ,
which equals the GD as defined in equation (20). Furthermore,
one can show that the stationary frequency equals the
instantaneous temporal frequency of the wave packet:
∂
˜ ) ,
arg E(t
ωs (t ) =
(36)

which provides a simple link between time and frequency for
stretched pulses. In the above derivation, it is only required
that the spectral envelope is ‘broad’ as compared to the
spectral width induced by the quadratic chirp. Any other broad
envelope E(ω) will also work, leading to a mapping of the
intensity from the spectral domain to the temporal domain,

where β = g − iδ0 /2. In this particular case, the result of the
SPA is exact because it was applied to a Gaussian pulse, but
the method is more general and it can be applied also to other
spectral envelopes. This is achieved by replacing the third term
in equation (38) by the more general expression: ln[E(ω)]/i.
In the special case of a Fourier-limited pulse, δ0 = 0,
the real part of the stationary frequency becomes the central
frequency of the pulse at all times, while the imaginary term
remains time dependent: ωs (t ) = ω0 + i(δ0 − t )/2g. This is
closely related to the Fourier-limited pulse shape, which has a
constant carrier frequency equal to the central frequency. The
imaginary part of the stationary frequency again imposes the
finite duration of the pulse in time.

(37)

Spectral

Constant

because the stationary frequency increases linearly in time as
shown in equation (35). The mapping of the spectral envelope
to the temporal envelope is scaled by the inverse spectral
chirp 1/δ0 so that an increased spectral chirp leads to a more
stretched pulse in the time domain. At the end of section 4.4,
we will see that the properties of these stretched light pulses
are similar to the way in which non-relativistic electrons are
dispersed through propagation in vacuum.

Summary of attosecond pulse propagation
In this section, we have reviewed the basic properties of light
pulses that propagate through a medium in one dimension.
Attosecond XUV light pulses are a special kind of light pulse
with a large spectral bandwidth. The larger the bandwidth,
the more sensitive the pulses are to the dispersion induced by
the medium. Using an appropriate medium, it is possible to
correct for spectral chirps and reduce the attosecond pulses
to their shortest possible duration. Once the attosecond pulses
are adjusted, they can be used to ionize atoms at extremely
well-defined times [74]. We now review the properties the
properties of non-relativistic photoelectron wave packets.

2.2.4. Ultra-short Gaussian pulse. Consider again an
attosecond pulse, equation (31), with a Gaussian envelope,
equation (33), but this time the envelope is not ‘broad’
compared to the quadratic spectral chirp, instead, as in the
cases of interest in attoscience, one has XUV pulses so that

light pulses and of photoelectron wave packets. The boundary
condition for all states is un,λ (0) = 0, and the states are taken
to be real. A photoelectron wave packet, in angular subspace
λ, can then be can be written as an integral–superposition of
continuum states

Attosecond XUV pulses have been used to initiate
photoelectron wave packets at well-defined times, but how
does such a wave packet evolve after the ionization event?
In this section, we perform an analysis of the evolution of
these wave packets and we shed light on the similarities with
the propagation of attosecond XUV pulses; see section 2.
Although our final goal is to describe photoionization as a
time-dependent process, we start our study with a theoretical
treatment of positive energy photoelectron wave packets
in the presence of a static binding potential. More details on
the actual attosecond–XUV transition are given in section 4,
while the important features related to laser probing in longrange Coulomb potentials are given in section 5.
In the absence of an external field, the time evolution of a
non-relativistic photoelectron is described by the TDSE [75]
∂
| (t ) ,
(42)
H0 | (t ) = [T + V0 ]| (t ) = i
∂t
where H0 is a time-independent Hamiltonian, and
=
(t, r) = r| (t ) is the time-dependent wavefunction. The
Hamiltonian consists of two parts: T = − 2 ∇ 2 /(2m) being
the kinetic energy operator and V0 = V0 (r) being a timeindependent, single-electron potential describing the binding
of the electron to the atom. For simplicity, we limit ourselves
to systems that can be described by a single electron, namely
the SAE approximation. A common approach to solving the
TDSE, equation (42), is to first find the solutions to the timeindependent Schr¨odinger equation
H0 ψα (r) =

(45)

where a( , t ) is the complex amplitude for the energynormalized radial state u ,λ (x) at energy > 0 .
3.1. Phase propagation of photoelectrons
The propagation of a photoelectron wave packet, equation (45),
is governed by the way in which the phases of the
continuum states u ,λ (x) vary as a function of energy . The
WKB approximation is well suited for studying continuum
states within a semi-classical framework [75]. The WKB
approximation relies on a similar ansatz as in section 2.1 for
XUV light. For an effective potential which vanishes at infinity,
i.e. limx→∞ V0 (x) = 0, the effective radial wavefunction is
taken to be
u (x) ∝ {exp[iφ( , x)]} = sin[φ( , x)],

(46)

where reference to λ is dropped for compactness. Inserting the
WKB ansatz into the Schr¨odinger equation (see equation (44))
leads to a differential equation for the phase of the state:

which the electron moves.
For a spherical potential V (r), the states can be written
on a spherical basis: ψα (r) = Rn,λ (r)Yλ,m (θ , φ), where Rn,λ
is the radial wavefunction and Yλ,m is the spherical harmonic,
for quantum numbers α = [n, λ, m], with spin neglected for
simplicity. It is possible to reduce the Schr¨odinger equation
into separate radial equations, each corresponding to a specific
angular momentum quantum number λ. To emphasize the
similarities and differences between the one-dimensional
propagation of light wave packets (section 2), the effective
radial electron states un,λ (r) = rRn,λ (r) are used. These
effective radial states can be interpreted as the solutions of
a one-dimensional Schr¨odinger equation for r > 0 with an
effective potential

The local momentum corresponds to the local kinetic energy,
which is the total energy minus the local potential energy. The
phase of the wavefunction varies faster as the local momentum
is increased. Equations (13) and (49) are now compared to
highlight the differences between the propagation of XUV
light and the photoelectrons. In a medium with negligible
dispersion, the phase of light is approximately proportional to
the photon momentum ω/c, leading to a simple translation of
the wave packet in space–time according to the shift theorem,
equation (15). Similarly, in regions of space where the action of

can be regarded as either ‘hard’ or ‘soft’ [76]. Photoelectrons
in a pure Coulomb potential, with no angular momentum,
will suffer a hard reflection at x0 = 0, with a reflection
phase of φx0 = 0, so that the wavefunction is exactly
zero at the reflection point, i.e. u(WKB) (0) ∝ sin(0) = 0.
Photoelectrons with the angular momentum λ > 0 will
reflect in an effective potential composed of the Coulomb
potential and the centrifugal potential at V0 (x0 ) ≡ Vr (x0 ) +
Vλ (x0 ) = . This combined barrier typically leads to reflection
points further out from the nucleus, x0 > 0, and to softer
reflections. A soft reflection implies that the photoelectron
wavefunction can extend a bit into the classically forbidden
region, x < x0 . The soft reflection limit, i.e. when the effective
potential is slowly varying compared to the wavelength
of the electron, can be calculated using a linear potential
so that the wavefunction becomes an Airy function with
a reflection phase of π /4 [75], but this is typically not
a good approximation for photoelectrons that we consider
here. An accurate determination of the reflection phase φx0
requires a fully quantum mechanical theory beyond the WKB
approximation and ab initio calculations of such phases present
a challenge to theory for large atomic systems or complex
molecular systems.

The real WKB solutions (thin black curves), equation (51), are
compared to the real free-electron states (thick grey curve) at three
different energies: = 1, 2, 3 au of energy (27.2 eV). The phase of
the electron wavefunction varies more rapidly in the potential,
which leads to an accumulated phase difference δ compared to the
free case. (Note that the modulations of the wavefunctions should be
interpreted in the third dimension of the graph, and not as an energy
modulation.)

shape under propagation. This nonlinear phase dependence
leads to a broadening effect referred to as ‘quantum diffusion’
and it originates physically from the fact that electrons of
different energies travel at different speeds. In the more general
case with dispersion, we may rewrite equation (49) and define
the ‘electron susceptibility’ χ (e) = −V0 (x)/ in analogy with
the linear susceptibility phase of light, χ (1) . The electron
phase is real as long as > V0 , but it will be imaginary if
< V0 , which implies that the electron must tunnel through
some barrier and that the transmission amplitude will be
exponentially damped.
When writing the WKB solution, it is natural to include
|∂ 2 φ/∂x2 | to leading order [75]. This leads to the well-known
form for the WKB state

3.2. Quantum diffusion and Wigner delays
As an example, consider the situation illustrated in figure 8,
where an electron passes through a short-range attractive
potential.
The electron is classically allowed to pass through the
potential, but as it does so, it will acquire a quantum phase.
The asymptotic phase difference, between an electron wave
propagating through a short-range potential, equation (49),
and free wave propagation, is defined in analogy with equation
(14):
δ( ) =

where p0 = 2m is the free (asymptotic) momentum of the
electron. The GD concept, equation (20), can also be applied
to electron wave packets using equation (53):
∂δ
∂δ
=
.
(54)
∂ω
∂
The electron GD then results only from the interaction with the
potential, since the intrinsic delay due to quantum diffusion
has been subtracted. Using the asymptotic phase, the delay
of electron wave packets was first calculated by Eisenbud,
Wigner and Smith [77–79], and hence named Eisenbud–
Wigner–Smith delay, (or Wigner delay for short). In the simple
scattering example given above, the asymptotic phaseshift
equals twice the radial phaseshift: once for the incoming
electron (0 > x) and once for the outgoing electron (0 < x).
Regarding photoionization, it can be considered as a halfcollision because the electron only moves out of the atom
(0 < x). As compared to free propagation, the delay of the
wave packet in photoemission is, therefore, the derivative of
the radial asymptotic phaseshift.

point, i.e. it separates a classically forbidden region, < V0 (x)

For a weak potential, |V0 |

p(x) ≈ p0 [1 − V0 (x)/2 ], which leads to an asymptotic phase

What does this space-divergent phase mean for the delay of
the photoelectron wave packet? When applying the frequency

It takes a shorter time, τλ < 0, for an electron to pass a
weak attractive potential, V < 0, than through free space.
Physically, this is due to the higher local velocity of the electron
in the potential valley. The opposite is true for a weak repulsive
potential, where the electron is slowed down on the potential
hill. Furthermore, the timing of slow electrons is affected more
than the timing of fast electrons, due to the longer total time
that the slow electrons spend in the potential. In terms of
numbers, this simple analysis leads to a delay of 5.9 as per eV
and nm of the potential barrier, given an electron with one unit
of atomic energy (27.2 eV).
3.3. Phases and delays in Coulomb potentials
Photoelectrons created from neutral atoms are submitted to
the long-range Coulomb potential of the remaining ion:
VC = −C/x, where the constant is C = Ze2 /(4π 0 ) with
Z = 1 for a singly charged hydrogen ion. In order to study
this long-range interaction in detail, we consider the WKB
approximation, equation (51). Then, the local momentum can

be neglected. As a consequence, τLR will completely dominate

over any (short-range) Wigner delay, τλ
∞. This implies that there is no absolute delay of the Coulomb
wave packet with respect to free propagation. Defining a
physical delay between two photoelectron wave packets of
different energy is already difficult for free propagation, due
to the different velocities of the photoelectrons as discussed
in equation (54), but it is even more difficult for Coulomb
wave packets due to the spatial dependence of the phase. In
the special case of two different Coulomb wave packets of the
same energy, the logarithmic delays cancel and their relative
delay then equals the difference in the Wigner delay. In this
way, we can talk about the delay of a Coulomb wave packet,
but only relative to a Coulomb reference, e.g., the hydrogenic
system. To summarize this analysis, for the propagation of
photoelectron wave packets, we find that the approximate
position is predominately given by the linear, free-propagation
relation: p0 x− τ = 0. The logarithmic, long-range phase is of
intermediate importance, and it dominates over the absolute,
short-range phase. On the other hand, only the short-range
phase contains detailed information about the atomic potential.
As already mentioned, the absolute determination of the
short-range asymptotic phaseshift η is a difficult problem,
because it depends on the detailed atomic potential, which
is modified by electron–electron interactions at short range. In
the special case of the hydrogen system of nuclear charge Z,
and for a given wave number k and angular momentum λ, the
phase is known analytically [75]:

τλ =

ηk,λ ≡ σk,λ + δk,λ ,

where δk,λ is the phase difference compared to hydrogen
that is induced by the short-range deviation from the pure
Coulomb potential. The WKB states are compared with the
exact Coulomb states for hydrogen in figure 9.
The exact analytical states of the hydrogen atom are called
the regular Coulomb functions of the first kind [80, 81]. The
WKB states converge quickly to the exact solution, if the
correct scattering phase is known and applied [76].

for x → ∞. Interestingly, the phase does not settle into freeparticle behaviour; instead, the phase diverges logarithmically!

4. Photoionization in the attosecond timescale
In this section, we will discuss, within the framework of
lowest order time-dependent perturbation theory [82, 83],
the photoionization of atoms in the presence of attosecond
XUV pulses (SAP or APT). Photoionization is a fundamental
process in the light–matter interaction, which has extensively
been studied using time-independent methods, in parallel
with the implementation of synchrotron radiation sources;
see, e.g., the seminal papers about Cooper minima and
photoelectron phaseshifts [84, 85]. Here, we start by studying
photoionization in the time domain, but as we proceed we
shall recover the more traditional, spectral representation for
the determination of the phaseshifts of the photoelectron
states, from which one can recover relative delays between
photoelectron wave packets.
Although attosecond pulses of high-order harmonics
have relatively high peak intensities, as compared to the
conventional sources of XUV radiation, the single-photon
absorption remains the dominant mechanism for atomic
ionization. Then, due to this fluence of XUV, or x-ray photons
being sufficiently small, the interaction between attosecond
pulses and atoms can be approximated using first-order, timedependent perturbation theory [82, 83]. The field-free TDSE,
as written in equation (42), is satisfied by the time-dependent
field-free states of the atom:

at the energy-conserving frequency
= ωα − ωi , where
|α is a continuum state under the SAE approximation. This
shows that the Fourier components of the attosecond pulse
are continuously mapped on the complex transition amplitude
associated with the photoionization process. Most attosecond
pulse-characterization schemes take advantage of this mapping
from XUV light to photoelectron states, see, e.g., [36] and [32,
33] for the attosecond streak camera and the RABITT method,
respectively, which we will discuss further in section 5.

the interaction, e.g., the momentum distribution, the complete

amplitudes and the corresponding reconstructed photoelectron
wave packets (1) (t ) , for increasing interaction durations τI .
From standard time-dependent perturbation theory,
we know that the total transition probability of a
perturbative excitation increases linearly with time, i.e. P =
d α |aα (t )|2 ∝ τI , as long as the depletion of the initial state
can be neglected. The photoelectron wave packet, in figure 10,
behaves indeed as expected since it extends linearly in space
as a function of the interaction time τI . The spatial extent
√ of the
wave packet is approximately x ≈ vc τI , where vc = 2 c /m
is the classical velocity of the photoelectron after ionization
and τI is the duration of the interaction. Inside this ‘classical’
extent of the wave packet, the probability density is roughly
constant.
Because the electron is ionized at a ‘well-defined time’,
namely during the brief interaction with the attosecond pulse,
the uncertainty principle dictates that its energy content must
be very broad. This can also be verified in figures 10 (g), (e),
(c) and (a) for progressively shorter interactions. It may be
of interest to know how long the photoelectron wave packet
remains ‘localized’ in time and space. At time τ after the
ionization, the electron wave packet will have spread in space
to an extent of r, which can be estimated from a classical
ensemble of velocities:

(68)

t→∞

of the field-free Hamiltonian with energy, k = 2 k2 /(2m).
The real expectation values |Sk/i |2 yield then the corresponding
probability density of the momentum states. These momentum
states are not plane waves, but they do approach a planewave-like behaviour in the asymptotic limit, r → ∞. Their
wavefunction, ϕk (r) = r|k , can be expanded on partial waves
as [83]

Interestingly, from this simple analysis, we find that the
photoelectron wave packet will extend its duration linearly
in τ . For photoelectrons ionized by attosecond pulses, with a
large bandwidth
≈ c , this implies that the temporal extent
of the electron wave packet is approximately equal to its time
of propagation t ≈ τ . In other words, we should not consider
these photoelectron wave packets as attosecond quantities. We
will return to the propagation of photoelectrons in section 4.4
for a more detailed analysis, but first we must consider the
actual photoionization process in more detail.

where the asymptotic phases clearly cancel with the phase
factors in equation (69) for each partial wave. However, there
remains a logarithmic term due to the long-range Coulomb
potential, as derived in section 3.3, which shows that the
asymptotic behaviour of the momentum state is not exactly
that of a simple plane wave. Furthermore, it is only the phase
difference between the partial waves that is physical, so that
the total phase of the state can be arbitrarily set.
In this way, the spectral intensity distribution of attosecond
XUV pulses can be determined using electron spectrometers,
such as TOF or VMI, to count the number of photoelectrons
reaching the detector, and then correcting for the dipole matrix
element, i.e. for the ‘quantum efficiency’ [86–88], as shown in
figure 1. We stress, however, that in either case, information
about the temporal structure of the XUV light pulse is not
accessible because the phase of the complex amplitude is not
measured.

4.2. Exponential turn-on of ionization
In the previous subsection, we considered a ‘flat-top’
XUV pulse shape, but envelopes with such sharp features
represent a rather poor idealization of the often smoothly
varying physical pulses. Rather than turning on the ionizing
field instantaneously, as was done above, the electric field
can be smoothly increased from minus infinity using a
‘slow’ exponential turn-on [82]. Even though this represents
an infinitely long interaction, we will show that it is
extremely important for a deep theoretical understanding of
photoionization phenomena also in the attosecond timescale.

strength as t → −∞. The attenuation factor ensures that the

By considering a simple ‘flat-top’ ( ) XUV attosecond pulse,
we can observe ‘snap-shots’ of how the photoelectron wave
packet builds up with time. The flat-top attosecond pulse
is of a given duration τI , and it has a central frequency of

ionization is ongoing and the electric field is on:

to the ‘well-known theorem from complex function theory’
[89]. The notation used requires some explanation: we write
δ for the Dirac delta function, and ℘ is written to indicate that
the discontinuity of 1/ ωα has been removed, so that when
integrated the result is Cauchy’s principal value. We mention
that this limiting form can be recovered by multiplying the
denominator of equation (73) by its complex conjugate and
then identifying the limits of the delta function β/(β 2 +

result as in equation (73), but with the opposite sign of

the slow turn-off, therefore, leads to symmetric cancellation

energy. In fact, the time-independent part of the wave packet
consists of two terms: the first one is associated with the
energy-conserving states, while the second term is a nontrivial principal-value superposition of non-energy-conserving
states. The latter states are out of phase by ±π /2 compared
to the energy-conserving contribution depending on whether
the energy denominator is positive or negative. This total
phase displacement of π can be understood in analogy with
a classical pendulum, which is set in motion by an external
oscillating force either in an over-driven or an under-driven
mode. Here, because we are dealing with quantum mechanics,
we need to sum over all possible ‘pendulums’ corresponding
to the continuum states above and below the resonance located
at κ .
More explicitly, the energy-conserving transition goes
from the initial, partial-wave state, |i ≡ |ni , i , mi , to
a superposition of energy-conserving, partial-waves states,
|c = |κ, λc , μc , where the summation over c implies that
λc = i ± 1 and μc = mi for linearly polarized light. Similarly,
the non-energy-conserving states can be written explicitly as
partial-wave states, |α = |κ , λα , μα , where α runs over both
the bound and continuous states, but κ = κ.

principal value P = I1 + I2 of outgoing waves: exp[i 2 r]/

electron enters the asymptotic region, r → ∞. The semicircle over
the pole I1/2 becomes −iπ times the corresponding residue as the
arc is reduced. Using Cauchy’s integral theorem, we write
I0 + I1 + I1/2 + I2 = 0,
√which implies that the principal value is
P ≈ −I1/2 = iπ exp[i 2 κ r]. A similar calculation can be made for
the incoming waves, but here the integration paths go into the
negative imaginary axis which results in an additional minus sign.
For simplicity, we have here omitted the phaseshifts, κ ,λ (r) and
the amplitude prefactors, since they present no further complication.
Atomic units were used for compactness.

The result from this calculation is that the imaginary

4.3. Asymptotic form of the photoelectron wave packet
It is not easy to directly infer the form of the first-order
wave packet from equation (75), but we expect that it should
be an outgoing wave. To see this, we first note that the
energy-conserving part is real and that the principal-value part
is imaginary, at t = 0. Next, we consider the asymptotic
form of the radial wavefunction for a photoelectron state
with

This intuitive form of the first-order wave packet is valid
asymptotically, as can be identified in figure 12, where we
have numerically calculated a representative first-order wave
packet for hydrogen.
Our result for the asymptotic form of the wave packet,
equation (79), is quite general and it can be applied to many
atomic systems by choosing an appropriate phase κ,λ (r), with
different asymptotic phaseshifts ηκ,λ , but also ionic charges
Z. Close to the core, the imaginary part of the wave packet
will go to zero (it will not diverge like the irregular solution
[75]). The polarization of the bound states is clearly visible
in figure 12 as a ‘bump’ in the imaginary part. Using the
asymptotic approximation, we neglect this short-range feature,
which turns out to be an excellent approximation for laserassisted photoionization, as we shall discuss in section 5. The

phaseshift and the coefficient for energy re-normalization is
Nκ = [2m/(π 2 2 α )]1/4 = 2m/(π 2 κ ). The asymptotic
part of the bound states can be neglected, because they decay
exponentially with the distance from the nucleus and cannot
affect the outgoing photoelectron. This allows us to aggregate
the sum over the bound state spectrum with the contribution
of the continuous spectrum in a single integral from minus
infinity to plus infinity. In this way, the smoothed ‘bound part’
is still exponentially damped and it will not contribute, but
the integral is easier to handle.
The principal-value part of the wave packet, equation (75),
is evaluated by rewriting the sine-function in equation (77) as
(r) ∼ exp[±iκ r]. It is

where ˜ (1) (0; ) ≡ (1) ( ). Note that the superposition
presented here is different from the one in equation (45),
because the latter includes a superposition of both ingoing and
outgoing waves, while equation (81) only contains outgoing
waves. This is due to the fact that we have already imposed a
time-boundary condition, namely that the laser field was not
on at t → −∞. As a consequence, equation (81) describes the
physical process at all times and for any pulse shape, without
the need for time-dependent complex amplitudes to describe
the population of the states, as would be required with equation
(45). The wave packet properties of this superposition can
be analysed using the SPA (see equation (31)) because, in
the limit of time going to infinity, the oscillations of the phase
factor will be fast compared to all pre-factors [79]. The SPA
is applied as

additional amount τLR (r)+τλ , corresponding to the long-range
and short-range corrections to the timing of the trajectory.

interpret, as we already discussed in section 3.3, but we may

in terms of the Coulomb Green’s function [91, 92]. In the
special case of an hydrogenic system, exact calculations can be
performed by using compact representations of the Coulomb
Green’s function [93, 94]. Furthermore, the wave packet can
be related to the so-called perturbed wavefunction, which
satisfies a corresponding inhomogeneous, time-independent
differential equation [54, 57]. In this sense, the wave packet
that we have derived using time-dependent perturbation theory
is a time-independent quantity, which plays a key role also in
time-independent perturbative methods!

Figure 13. Photoionization in time and space. (a) Initially, at the ionization event t = 0, the wave packet is located at the atom. As the
electron leaves the atom, the slow part of the wave packet is stretched far away from the fast part due to quantum diffusion. (b) The
momentum distribution |ak |2 of the wave packet is naturally accessible using a TOF detector, where the probability distribution of fast
electrons are detected first, and the slow electrons arrive later. To make this example more interesting, the attosecond pulse has a ‘cat’
encoded in its momentum distribution, this ‘cat’ eventually appears in the space–time distribution. (A more conservative momentum
distribution would correspond to the odd harmonics of HHG.)

space–time, then we know that the fast electrons will reach the
detector (at r) first.
In the case of an APT consisting of high-order harmonics,
the photoelectrons from the highest harmonic will arrive
first, followed by an empty region and then the next highest
harmonic, and so on. The fact that they were ionized at several
short instances apart, namely at each peak of the APT, cannot
be observed directly in the TOF spectrometer due to the strong
quantum diffusion taking place in the flight tube. In some
sense, the signature of the APT or SAP is seen already in
the energy and momentum distributions because the electrons
do arrive in bursts for each harmonic or in a continuous
bunch [96], but in order to access the detailed attosecond
timescale, one has to probe the photoelectron wave packets
with a coherent IR laser field. Next, we shall describe different
implementations of this concept.

which implies that the electron arrives faster than if it was
propagating freely! The physical reason is that, as we discussed
in relation to equation (56), attractive potentials lead to a
greater local velocity of the electrons. Also the short-range
interaction may have a negative delay, which classically can
be interpreted as the electron being somewhat advanced, i.e.
starting at a small radial distance, aeff = −τλ /vc > 0, outside
the origin. In the case of the Coulomb potential, the Wigner
delays are, however, positive, and such simple arguments do
not apply. In the asymptotic limit, these corrections are very
small compared to the free-travel time and can be neglected.
This implies that the dominant contribution to the electron
wave packet at a given point in space–time (r, t ) arises from
the part of the wave packet that fulfils the simple relation:
vct ≈ r. We then obtain that the probability density of the
photoelectron in an integrated angular channel is

ρ(t, r) = | (1) (r, t )|2 ∼ |aκ |2 ,

where aκ is the complex amplitude of the state with wave
number κ and the time dependence can be understood as
a radial quantum diffusion of the wave packet, in good
agreement with the simple classical analysis presented above
in equation (72). This mapping of complex amplitudes into
space and time is the basic principle of the TOF detection
scheme, which is used in many attosecond experiments. In
figure 13, we sketch the rough dynamics of photoionization.
The photoelectron momentum-to-space mapping, described above, is similar to the frequency-to-time mapping
for super-chirped light pulses, which was discussed in section
2.2.3. For photoelectrons, the mapping occurs automatically
after long enough times, and there is no need for a dispersive
material. Classically, the electron mapping is obvious since
electrons in a classical distribution are moving at different
speeds. If we know that they all started at a distinct point in

5. Theory of XUV photoionization in the presence of
an IR field
As shown in the preceding sections, attosecond delays in
photoionization can be deduced from the energy dependence
of the phases of the transition amplitudes associated with
the process. In the experiments reported so far, an auxiliary
IR laser field is used as a ‘clock’ to measure the delays.
Then, the analysis is somewhat more complicated by the
presence of this additional dressing field. Indeed, in the
presence of an IR laser field, the photoelectron released upon
absorption of one XUV photon can absorb and emit IR
photons, thereby changing its energy. Provided that the IR
field is weak, the energy of the electron will change as the
result of the exchange of only one IR photon at most, so that
the overall process amounts to a two-photon transition. In this

section, we give a theoretical background relevant to treat
this class of laser-assisted photoionization, with special
emphasis on the contribution from stimulated continuum–
continuum transitions using second-order time-dependent
perturbation theory [82]. These transitions are associated
with the so-called above-threshold ionization (ATI) processes,
because the electron is already free when it exchanges the
second photon.
The time-dependent dipole interaction with the fields,
linearly polarized along the z-axis, is written as V˜ (z, t ) =
V˜I (z, t ) + V˜II (z, t ), where we have separated the dipole
interaction with the XUV field, V˜I (z, t ) in equation (66), from
the subsequent dipole interaction with the laser field,

where we have identified the first-order wave packet from

one, as given in equation (65). In the latter, the electron makes
a transition from the initial bound state into the field-free
continuum, creating a first-order wave packet | ˜ (1) (t ) . In
the second-order amplitude, this first-order wave packet can
be seen as the initial state for the second interaction, and the
transition towards the final state will occur towards a different
continuum state. We can write the second-order wave packet

Here, the photoelectron undergoes ATI transitions that
require a precise representation of the continuum states, which
makes ab initio computations a formidable task for multielectron atoms or molecules. However, as we shall show
next, it is feasible to derive a convenient approximation
method designed to evaluate the phaseshift induced by the
continuum–continuum transition stage of the process. An
accurate determination of these phases are, in fact, essential to
interpret correctly the delays as measured in recent attosecond
time-delay experiments.

The two-photon S-matrix (see equation (92)) has an
intuitive time-independent interpretation: the integral over I
can be seen as an integral over all the different quantum paths
that can lead to the final state | f . In order to reach this
specific final state, the photon energies of the XUV and IR
fields must satisfy a global energy-conservation requirement.
If both interactions have a broad bandwidth, then there is
also a broad range of photon pairs available. This results in a
‘blurring’ effect that arises from the convoluted quantum paths.
If one of the fields, say the probe, is quasi-monochromatic

5.1.1. Long-range amplitude corrections. So far, we have
established that the ‘long-range phases’, i.e. the logarithmic
divergence of the Coulomb phases in equation (95), is
important for the phase of ATI transitions in an ionic potential
of charge Z. In order to improve our asymptotic approximation,
we must also include long-range amplitude variations. We do
this by returning the normalization constants Nk and Nκ back
inside the radial integral in equation (94), and write them
as the functions Nk (r) and Nκ (r) for the radial amplitude
variations [54]. In analogy with the local momentum from
WKB theory, as stated in equation (50), these effects can then
be approximated by expanding the normalization factors so

with equation (100) corresponding to the long-range phase
and amplitude data (P + A) in figure 15. We note that this
amplitude correction leads to an excellent agreement with the
exact calculation at high energies. The Taylor expansion in
equation (99) is, however, problematic because the Coulomb
potential will dominate over the kinetic energy close to the
core, Z/r > k as r → 0, which implies that the expansion is
invalid for r < Z/ k . This leads to an artificial divergence of
the electron wavefunction close to the core, which is physically
unreasonable because the wavefunction should vanish at r = 0.
Because an accurate analytical expression for the
continuum–continuum phase can be a valuable tool in
the analysis of experimental data, we may try to avoid the
region close to the core, by an ad hoc mathematical trick,
namely by changing the starting point of the radial integral.
Indeed, the result presented as (P + A ) in figure 15 is
closer to the exact calculation, where the gamma function
in equation (101) was replaced by an incomplete gamma
function. The best imaginary starting point was found to be
r0 = iZ(1/κ 2 + 1/k2 )/4 by trial and error. (This matching
procedure is slightly different from the one presented in [54].)
Strictly speaking, at very low kinetic energy, here below 8 eV,
the asymptotic approximation breaks down. Physically, this
is due to an increasing influence of the Coulomb potential
for slow electrons. Mathematically, this is expected since
the asymptotic expressions for the Coulomb function have
kr as arguments, which implies that a small k will lead to a
‘good’ asymptotic wavefunction only at a large distance r from
the core [80].

(P + A and P + A ) lead to quantitative agreement, at high enough
energy, with the exact calculations in hydrogen (+ and ×).

arg[Sa ] = arg[Se ]. In experiments, the phase of the twophoton amplitudes labelled (a) and (e) can be controlled by
changing the sub-cycle delay τ between the probe field and
the attosecond pulses. More precisely, one controls the relative
phase of the IR field, φ±ω ≡ ±ωτ in equation (97), with
respect to the group delay of the XUV pulse. The probe–
phase dependence is Sa ∝ Eω ∝ exp[iωτ ] and Se ∝ Eω∗ ∝
exp[−iωτ ]. This implies that the cross-terms in equation (102)
vary differently as a function of τ : (d)–(a) and (d)–(e) are
modulated with periodicity ωτ associated with the exchange
of only one IR photon [97], while the cross-term (a)–(e) is
modulated with the periodicity 2ωτ due to the two IR photons
involved [32, 33].
The latter transitions are directly involved in the RABITT
scheme, since path (d) does not contribute. This is because
only odd XUV harmonics are used to photoionize the atom,
as was indicated in figure 5, so that the signal from cross-term
(a)–(e) occurs at zero-background. Let us emphasize that in the
case of a SAP of XUV radiation, the delay-dependent
modulation of the photoionization signal at the central energy
0 will also be given by the cross-term (a)–(e) alone, because
the other two cross-terms cancel with each other [54]. All
the cross-terms in equation (102) together form the on-set of
streaking, i.e. a small constructive or destructive interference
at the high or low momentum, respectively, so that the average
momentum of the photoelectron is deflected by different
amounts depending on τ . Provided that the soft-photon
approximation is valid, the displacement of this entire structure
for a laser-assisted SAP is exactly equal to that of APT [54].
Therefore, the maximal probability for photoemission occurs
when the amplitudes associated with paths (a) and (e) are in
phase, arg[Sa ] = arg[Se ], which is equivalent to

We stress that the delays presented in equation (104)
are calculated from the finite-difference approximations to the
actual derivatives, τGD = ∂φ /∂ and τλ = ∂ηκ,λ /∂ . For
these approximations to be valid, we must require that the
spectral phases vary slowly, e.g., that | φ | ≡ |φ > −φ < |
2π , corresponding to a small phase variation over two laser
photons,
= 2ω. Using the framework presented in
section 2.1.1, one can easily show that these slowly varying
phases imply that the frequency components of the attosecond
pulse must be confined to within a fraction of the laser period.
In this sense, ‘slow reactions’, e.g., resonances, which induce
a dramatic phase jump in the spectral domain, are difficult
to study using the conventional RABITT scheme. In the
case of streaking, the delays arise also as finite-difference
approximations to the actual delays, but here the smallest
energy difference is instead one laser photon,
= ω [54].
The atomic delays, τθ = τλ + τcc , are shown in figure 16,
corresponding to the case of hydrogen, with τλ for a few
different values of the angular momentum λ.
In this way, it is possible to ‘measure’ the group delay
of the attosecond pulse provided that the atomic delay, τθ =
τλ + τcc , can be calculated accurately and that it is subtracted
from the experimental data. The first observation of attosecond
pulse structures in 2001 was made in this way by subtracting
the influence of the ‘atomic phase’ as calculated by means

ionization, i.e. an asymptotic temporal shift of the
photoelectron wave packet. Strictly speaking, this delay
is interesting, i.e. giving information on the electron

(dae ), (dea ), (aa) and (ee). Here, (dae ) and (dea ) can be regarded
as corrections to the direct path (d), because they exchange
two probe photons so that the total energy is unchanged. Any
such ‘probe-photon loops’, indicated by grey rings in figure 14,
involve two continuum–continuum transitions: k → κ → k.
Therefore, they acquire two continuum–continuum phases
φcc (κ, k) and φcc (k, κ ) = −φcc (κ, k), which compensate each
other. For instance, the phase of (dae ) and (dea ) is equal to
that of the direct path (d) (except for trivial perturbation
expansion coefficients). The two other paths (aa) and (ee) yield
a new probability modulation at 4ωτ , due to the four photons
involved in the (aa)–(ee) cross-term, and they will not disturb
the lower order modulations. One can show that the modulation
shift of the (aa)–(ee) cross-term will be approximately equal
to that of the (a)–(e) cross-term, so that no fundamentally
new information is obtained at this higher modulation rate, as
reported in the experimental work by Swoboda et al [107].
In this way, including additional probe-photon loops, one can
argue for the validity of equation (104), also when higher
order contributions become important, at least while the probe
interactions remain in the perturbative regime and the bound
states are not dressed too much.
In the following section, we will review the state-ofthe-art experimental effort to measure these delays in laserassisted photoionization. As we will see, there are so far
few experimental results to compare with the theoretical
predictions, and in addition, these experimental data points
are located in highly complex regions, e.g., close to pseudoresonances in neon [106] and correlation-induced Cooper
minima in argon [108], where the SAE approximation is likely
to break down.

of complex two-photon matrix elements [31]. We stress that
the exact temporal structure of the attosecond pulse is not
measured directly, neither with the RABITT nor with the
attosecond streak-camera technique, but that the influence of
the atomic potential tends to decrease at high kinetic energy.
The question of the precise determination of these ‘atomic
delays’ (also called ‘streaking delays’) and of their importance
in RABITT and streaking measurements has motivated a large
number of theoretical studies; see [98–106]. Much of this
recent work has focused on the attosecond streak-camera
technique, where typically non-perturbative approaches are
employed to account for high-order photon processes with the
probe field. In the next subsection, we will also comment on
the influence of such an intense probe field with a viewpoint
from perturbation theory using the asymptotic approximation.
Alternatively, the Wigner-like delay τλ can be determined
if τGD is known from independent measurements and if
τcc can be calculated [46, 54]. However, since the precise
characterization of the attosecond pulse requires the previous
knowledge of τλ , it would seem that we have run into
an uncomfortable circular argument. Instead, if the ‘same’
attosecond pulse is used to photoionize simultaneously
different atomic states, information about the differences in
atomic delays, τθ = τλ + τcc , can be obtained directly in the
experiment, without any need to know the temporal structure
of the attosecond pulse [45, 46]. Then, by simply subtracting
the universal τcc as given in equation (104), the τλ -difference
between the two photoelectrons is obtained. A similar
separation of the time delays as shown in equation (104) was
reported by the group of Burgd¨orfer for streaking of SAP by
numerically solving the TDSE [104, 105]. Interestingly, they
also showed that τcc (termed ‘the Coulomb-laser coupling’)
could be calculated from a classical ensemble of electrons
interacting simultaneously with both the laser field and the
Coulomb potential. Prior to these successful demonstrations
of the separability of the two contributions, the influence of
the short-range scattering phaseshifts was shown by Yakovlev
et al [99] and the importance of the long-range Coulomb tail
was discussed by Zhang and Thumm [102].

6. Experimental observations of attosecond delays in
photoemission
The approximations for laser-assisted photoionization
described in section 5 hold very well for atomic systems,
where the photoelectron can be described within the SAE
approximation. In fact, the accuracy of the asymptotic
approximation was first benchmarked by comparison with
exact calculations in hydrogen carried out by Ta¨ıeb [46, 54].
The experimental work on photoionization time delays, on
the other hand, is carried out on many-electron systems, most
often noble gas atoms, such as neon and argon. The question
then arises to which degree the SAE approximation is valid
for these systems, and especially so when the photoelectron
is released, not from the outer-most orbital, but from ‘inside’
the core. Screening effects due to electron correlation can be
accounted for using MBPT, such as the RPA, or more elaborate
methods [101, 105, 106, 108], but we have not considered
such corrections here. We predict, however, that in the coming
years, the interpretation of attosecond experiments will offer
a new testing ground for many-body calculations. Future
experiments will provide interesting opportunities to test
various theoretical methods, such as MBPT, for light-induced
electron–electron interactions in connection to measurements
of phases and delays in complex atomic and molecular
systems. At this point, we report that a satisfactory agreement

5.3. Towards higher probe intensities
So far the discussion has been conducted within a perturbative
framework, by retaining the lowest order contributions from
the IR probe field. A natural task is then to investigate the
consequences of an increased probe-field intensity. Numerical
evaluations of the TDSE show that a strong probe field will
alter the temporal information [58]. A modest increase of the
probe intensity will, however, not alter the observed delay.
This stability of the delay at low-intensity probe fields was first
pointed out by Zhang and Thumm [100] within the Eikonal–
Volkov approximation [53] by considering a weak probe field.
Using perturbation theory for the interaction with the
probe field makes it difficult to draw conclusions about the
strong-probe field interaction, but it is possible to apply
the asymptotic approximation (see equation (94)) also for
processes involving additional probe photons. In figure 14, the
complex amplitudes involving two probe photons are labelled:

Figure 17. Delay experiment for the 3s and 3p states in Ar using APT. The APT is composed of three odd harmonics, 2q + 1, that ionize
(pump) electrons from either initial state, 3s or 3p, into the continuum. After absorbing a harmonic photon, the photoelectron can either
absorb or emit a laser probe photon in order to reach an even number SB state, labelled by 2q. The SB probability oscillates with the delay

modulation offset between the same SB numbers from different initial states [46].

GD of the attosecond pulses. A breakthrough in measuring
these atomic delays was possible due to the new way that the
experiment was performed, where two RABITT scans were
recorded simultaneously from two different initial orbitals.
Interestingly, in this setup, the unknown temporal structure of
the attosecond pulses can be subtracted without ever knowing
their exact shape, as can be understood by considering equation
(104). While the experiments are distinctly different, the
method was inspired by the previous delay measurements
using SAP [44, 45]. A schematic illustration of the experiment
is shown in figure 17.
In this work, the high-order harmonic comb was first
passed through a thin chrome foil acting as a bandpass
to separate four odd harmonics (21–27). In this way,
only three SBs, i.e. SB:22, 24, 26, were produced when
ionizing argon atoms from either orbital. This limiting of
the harmonic comb was made to prevent different SBs
from different orbitals to overlap in photoelectron kinetic
energy. The analysis of the experiment [46] was first carried
out within the SAE approximation using Hartree–Fock
phaseshifts from the literature [85], an adequate theoretical
method for photoelectrons from the outer orbital 3p. On
the other hand, photoelectrons from the inner orbital 3s
couple strongly with the outer orbital, and the corresponding
single-photon phaseshifts are greatly altered. This important

between theory and experiment has not yet been reached, and
that more experiments are needed in ‘simple’ energy regions,
where perhaps more straightforward analysis would apply. In
the following, we will proceed with a brief overview of the
current experimental effort. We will place special emphasis
on the time-delay measurements and phase measurements
using APT, where we have taken an active part, but we will
also discuss the experiments using SAP. We stress that both
approaches aim at measuring the so-called atomic delays [31]
and that the one-photon Wigner delay can be accessed only
after subtracting the continuum–continuum delay as computed
by either the quantum mechanical or classical approaches [46,
104].
6.1. Atomic-delay measurements using the APT
A delay of 110 as between the 3p and 3s states
in argon has been measured experimentally by Kl¨under
et al using an APT with a photon energy of ∼35 eV
[46]. Theoretically, this delay is identified as a difference of
atomic delays between two orbitals. These concepts in laserassisted photoionization dates back to the first measurements
of attosecond pulses in 2001 using RABITT [31, 33],
but the delays, by themselves, had never been accessible
experimentally before due to the simultaneously unknown

Figure 18. Phase induced by the 1s 3p state in He using APT. The phase in photoionization δτ depends on the detuning δ between the
harmonic (2q − 1)ω = 15ω and the bound state 1s 3p. The effect arises from the π -jump that occurs in the two-photon amplitude, when
passing the resonance. The higher lying SB, i.e. SB:2q + 2, acts as an important ‘reference clock’ in this experiment, which is mostly
insensitive to small frequency changes of the harmonic fields [109].

effect was identified by Kheifets by including RPA effects in
the absorption of a single XUV photon. Interestingly, these
photoelectrons exhibit a correlation-induced minimum in the
one-photon ionization step, i.e. a complex kind of Cooper
minimum [84], with a corresponding peak of several hundreds
of attoseconds in the atomic delay [108]. This is, indeed, a
challenging spectral region that requires careful theoretical
attention.
The signal can also be strongly altered by atomic
resonances. In the spectral domain, an APT corresponds to
harmonics that can be ‘aimed’ towards specific energy regions
of interest. The frequency of the harmonics from the HHG
process can be tuned naturally by changing the fundamental
(driving) laser pulse frequency ω + δω so that the high-order
harmonic frequencies increase or decrease by δ = (2q +
1)δω. Swoboda et al found that the phase of the modulation
of the lowest lying SB in helium depended critically on the
frequency of the harmonics [109]. In figure 18, an illustration
of the principle of the experiment is shown.
The observed modulation shifts were attributed to a phase
effect occurring over the intermediate bound state, 1s 3p1 P1 ,
which was ‘on resonance’ with a below-threshold harmonic,
15 ω < Ip(He) . The modulation shift was then compared to
the corresponding case in argon, where the harmonic instead
directly creates a photoelectron, 15 ω > Ip(Ar) , and where
the bound states do not contribute considerably. By tuning
the harmonic over the sharp resonance, an abrupt π -shift is
expected. The experimental π -shift is, however, ‘smoothed’

due to the finite duration of the laser probe field and of the
APT (∼30 fs), which is much shorter than that of the longlived bound state. In order to fully resolve the abrupt rise of
the delay due to pure atomic effects, one needs harmonics
that are narrower in frequency than the atomic resonance,
i.e. an APT which is longer than the lifetime of the state.
Similar phaseshifts have also been found and analysed at shortlived complex continuum resonances in nitrogen molecules
[110, 111]. In this case, the lifetimes are more comparable to
the duration of the APT, implying that the observed modulation
shifts contain some information of about the lifetime of the
resonances.
6.2. Atomic-delay measurements using SAP
For a long time it was believed that the so-called attosecond
streak camera [35], provided a direct link between the
time domain and the energy domain, as often illustrated by
measuring the oscillations of few-cycle optical light pulses
[39]. This stand point needed to be revised after an experiment
by Schultze et al, where it was stated that ‘the zero of time in
atomic chronoscopy is currently tainted with an error of up to
several tens of attoseconds’ [45], due to a measured time delay
of ∼20 as between the streaked photoelectrons from the 2p and
2s shells in neon at an XUV photon energy of 100 eV. The key
to obtaining this intriguing experimental result was to collect
simultaneously two streaked photoelectron spectrograms from
two different initial atomic states, thus accessing the difference
27

J. Phys. B: At. Mol. Opt. Phys. 45 (2012) 183001

Tutorial

in streaking delay between the two processes. Interestingly, by
measuring this difference in timing, the unknown GD of the
attosecond pump pulse cancels out, because it is the same
in both processes, as can be identified using equation (104).
The experimental results motivated a great deal of further
theoretical work, where it was concluded that the long-range
Coulomb tail is responsible for a considerable part of the
observed delay in streaking [100, 102, 104]. In addition to
this long-range effect, the laser-induced polarization of the
atom can lead to a shift of the streaking delay if the probe field
is too strong [53, 98]. Extensive theoretical works including
many multi-electron effects have so far only accounted for
a fraction of the experimental time-zero shift [101, 106].
The theory of the attosecond streak camera has recently
been refined to account for the long-range Coulomb tail
by matching the asymptotic wavefunction to an appropriate
scattering state [103]. While this work holds potential for
obtaining compact analytical expressions for the atomic
delays, it is controversial in its current form, as also stressed
in [105]. This is because it goes against the separation of
the delays in equation (104), where the continuum–continuum
delay does not depend on the Wigner delay. We refer the reader
to [54] for a more detailed discussion, but we note here that the
comparison with our work in [103] is to that where long-range
amplitude corrections are not taken into account.
In conclusion, the attosecond pump–probe schemes using
a SAP or APT, shown in figures 4(b) and (c), respectively,
can be used to obtain information about the probe fielddressed system, and not directly the probe-free system. To
explore properties of the unprobed system using experimental
data where the probe is present, a theoretically reliable way
of accounting for the probe must be found [46, 104]. By
decreasing the intensity of the probe field, the streaking
modulation is reduced and one arrives in a regime where
standard perturbation theory is applicable [54]. This presents
a large advantage for quantitative theoretical work, since it can
be based on well-established MBPT.

of different even harmonics was observed as a function of
the delay between ω and 2ω fields. Early experimental and
theoretical work suggested that the phase of this modulation
could be used to characterize the emission times of attosecond
pulses [21, 56, 116]. Experimentally, it was eventually found
that the phase behaved in an unexpected way close to the
harmonic cut-off [117], which, after some more detailed
calculations [72], lead to a new interpretation of the observed
delays with, instead, a connection to the Keldysh tunnelling
parameter [118].
The delay in tunnelling ionization has been studied by
the group of Keller using angular streaking, often referred
to as the ‘attoclock’ [119–121]. In this setup, a close-tocircularly polarized femtosecond laser field is used to tunnelionize electrons. The subcycle resolution is obtained by
studying angular displacements of the final momentum of
the photoelectrons. Using this angular streaking method a
vanishing tunnelling delay has been confirmed. We need to
stress the differences between the two kinds of streaking:
the conventional form of streaking requires a SAP and a
femtosecond probing laser field with linear polarization, while
the angular streaking requires only a single femtosecond
pulse with a tailored polarization. In regular streaking,
temporal information about laser-assisted, single-XUV-photon
ionization is gained, while in the case of angular streaking, the
temporal aspects of strong-field (multi-photon) tunnelling is
studied. The theoretical work presented in [121] highlights the
difficulties and prospects of self-probing systems involving
electron continuum probes initiated through strong-field
tunnelling.

7. Conclusions and outlook
Attosecond science is attracting a great deal of attention
because it promises accurate control and probing of electron
processes in atomic and molecular systems in real time.
In this tutorial, we have presented a detailed theoretical
analysis of photoionization of neutral atoms by attosecond
XUV pulses and coherent XUV high-order harmonics. We
have found that, indeed, attosecond pulses can be used to
initiate photoionization at well-defined times, but to probe such
an ultra-fast event requires careful considerations about the
quantum-mechanical interactions between the photoelectron
and the remaining ion. Ultimately, it is commonly believed
that the probing process will be carried out using a second
attosecond pulse, but such experiments are demanding due to
the need for two-photon processes in the XUV range. We refer
the reader to [51] for a state-of-the-art experimental scheme
using XUV for both pumping and for probing the processes
on a timescale bordering the attosecond domain.
At the present time, the temporal aspects of
photoionization are probed more often by a phase-locked,
IR-laser field. This has the advantage of a much stronger
interaction with the photoelectron; in fact, here the interaction
can be so strong that many such laser photons are absorbed.
This situation is called ‘streaking’ because it can shift
the photoelectron-momentum distribution to higher or lower
values depending on the subcycle delay between the attosecond

6.3. Other attosecond time-delay experiments
Finally, in this subsection, we briefly discuss other attosecond
delay experiments that are not directly related to singlephoton ionization by an XUV field. This important class
of attosecond experiments are conducted in the HHG cell
directly, and they are sometimes referred to as self-probing
systems; see [112] for a recent tutorial on self-probing of
molecules with HHG. In these experiments, the electron wave
packet in the continuum is thought of as a probe for the entire
system, holding promise of simultaneous temporal and spatial
resolution of molecular dynamics [50]. In this subsection,
we will restrict ourselves to one of the simplest self-probing
systems, namely atoms undergoing HHG in two-colour laser
fields consisting of a strong fundamental ω and a much weaker,
parallel second harmonic 2ω. An interesting aspect of this
two-colour setup is that the presence of the second harmonic
breaks the inversion symmetry of the HHG process, which
leads to the production of odd and even harmonics [113–115].

pulses and the probe field. This highly nonlinear process is
difficult to handle with high-fidelity in theory, and this is the
main reason why we have considered instead the interaction
with a moderate probe field, which may induce exchange of a
single IR-laser probe photon at most.
Such moderate probe fields are the standard choice in
the temporal probing of APT using the RABITT scheme. We
have demonstrated [54] that this interferometric interpretation
is valid also for SAP in the on-set of streaking. Using this
‘photon-picture’, we have identified the phases of the lowest
order quantum paths and we have shown that the same
temporal information about the photoionization process is
gained with either pulse structure, SAP or APT.
Placing an interpretation on the ‘delay’ in laser-assisted
photoionization is not as straightforward as indicated by
the early streak-camera formalism [36]. This is because the
strong-field approximation is not a reliable approximation
for laser-assisted photoionization. Instead, it turns out that
the long-range interaction between the photoelectron and the
remaining ion leads to a shift of the time delays [100], which
often dominates over the one-photon, Wigner-like delays of
the photoelectron [99]. Using time-dependent perturbation
theory, we have shown that these ‘measurement artefacts’
can be separated from the Wigner-like delays, as written
explicitly in equation (104), in the case of both APT [46] and
SAP [104]. Furthermore, we have shown that these temporal
artefacts can be traced back to phaseshifts in ATI transitionmatrix elements between continuum states, and hence termed
‘continuum–continuum phases’ [54]. We have here presented
both correction curves and analytical expressions for the
purpose of correcting for such artefacts in the quest for the
true delay in single-photon ionization.
In this tutorial, we have limited ourselves to the SAE
approximation, with a single photoelectron in a static atomic
potential. While this approach is certainly valid for hydrogenic
systems [54], it is likely to break down in many-electron
atoms, when electron–hole interactions are strong and when
the electron relaxation plays an important role for the
dynamics. Here, accurate calculations that include multielectron screening effects of the ion are required. Although
a few full-scale simulations have been made including manyelectron dynamics [101, 106], a conclusive agreement between
experiment and theory is yet to be presented. This calls for
both more experimental data and detailed theoretical work,
and then, a careful comparison of the two. In this way, the
time-delay experiments provide an important testing ground
for more exact analysis and interpretations in attosecond
physics and strong-field physics. Only when understanding
these detailed ultra-fast phenomena, ‘attophysics’ will truly
provide a route to accurate control and probing of electron
processes in atomic and molecular systems in real time.
