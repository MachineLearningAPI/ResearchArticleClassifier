Abstract
We study the behaviour of weakly bound clusters and their relation to the well-known
three-body Efimov states. We adopt a model to describe the universal behaviour of strongly
interacting bosonic systems, and we test its validity by reproducing predictions of three- and
four-body universal states. Then, we extend our study to larger systems and identify a series of
universal cluster states that can be qualitatively interpreted as adding one particle at a time to
an Efimov trimer. The properties of these cluster states and their experimental signatures are
discussed.

The universal behaviour of quantum systems has attracted
much attention from the atomic, condensed-matter and
nuclear physics communities. Theoretical and experimental
studies strongly suggest that the ultracold behaviour of twocomponent Fermi gases is characterized by a single interaction
parameter: the scattering length a (see [1] and references
therein). In contrast, there is no comprehensive understanding
of universality in bosonic systems with large a. For weakly
interacting dilute systems, there exists a gaslike state in
which interactions depend on a. However, this state becomes
unstable against collapse as a increases [2]. At the three-body
level (N = 3), Efimov physics [3] leads to a different concept
of universality. In this case, two parameters are necessary
to describe the low-energy behaviour: a and the three-body
parameter, κ0 , that is related to the energy of an Efimov state at
unitarity (|a| = ∞). The experimental observation of Efimov
phenomena in ultracold gases [4] has reinvigorated the interest
in universal few-body physics.
The extension of Efimov physics to larger systems has
been an issue of debate. Initial studies [5], based on restricting
approximations, proposed the existence of an ‘N-body Efimov
effect’ for systems with N > 3. This prediction does not
agree with a full quantum-mechanical treatment of the fourboson problem [6]. Recent four-body studies [6–8] predict
that the system is universal, i.e. no new parameter is needed,
0953-4075/10/101002+05$30.00

and the low-energy behaviour of the system is only described
by a and κ0 . The experimental observation of resonant fourbody features [9], in agreement with theoretical predictions
of [6], strengthens our confidence in the understanding of
universal four-body phenomena. Another series of studies
focused on the existence of weakly bound cluster states.
These studies considered such systems as 4 He and tritium
or others that interact through realistic van der Waals or other
model potentials [10–13]. Although there are clear differences
between these studies, their predictions are qualitatively
similar, possibly indicating the underlying universal behaviour.
Furthermore, the studies of [13] suggest that cluster states only
depend on two- and three-body physics. This opens up the
possibility of predicting universal properties of cluster states
only in terms of a and κ0 [7].
Here, we propose a method to explore the properties
of bosonic systems with large a. We adopt a model
Hamiltonian that combines two- and three-body interactions
and allows the independent control of a and κ0 . Our model
Hamiltonian is based on Efimov solutions of the three-body
problem and designed to significantly reduce the nonuniversal
corrections of the lowest energy states. This property makes
it particularly suitable for studying larger systems for which
only the lowest states are computationally accessible. Using
numerical techniques, such as diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC)

and correlated-Gaussian (CG) basis-set expansion, we study
the properties of clusters. First, we show that the model
Hamiltonian reproduces the universal behaviour of threeand four-body systems. Second, we extend our calculations
to systems with N
13 particles, and we obtain results
consistent with the premise of universality. We conclude that
for each Efimov state, there is at least one N-body cluster state.
These N-body cluster states are only controlled by two- and
three-body physics and inherit many properties of the universal
three- and four-body states. The cluster states are formed
by long-range binding and fall into the category of quantum
halos [14] since most of their probability is in the classically
forbidden region. For large a, the energies of different cluster
states are linearly related, forming Tjon lines [15]. Also,
under certain conditions, the N-body cluster is bound, while
all smaller clusters are unbound. This behaviour manifests
the Borromean nature of the states [11]. Our predictions
describe states of physical systems that fulfil the conditions
of universality: large a (|a| larger than any other length scale
of the interactions) and long-range binding. In experimental
studies, these conditions might not be fully satisfied by the
lowest Efimov family, but can be quantitatively fulfilled by
excited families whose cluster states are resonances and,
therefore, have a finite width.
Model Hamiltonian. To construct a model Hamiltonian
that captures the essence of Efimov physics, we consider
the analytical solutions of a three-body system with zerorange interactions in the hyperspherical framework [16]. In
this representation, the description of the system reduces to
a one-dimensional Schr¨odinger equation in the hyperradius

E3b,n
model Hamiltonian g0 is then g0 (κn R) for all R > Rc and 0
otherwise.
Figure 1 summarizes the basic idea of this regularization
scheme.
Note that only a very small fraction of the
wavefunction g0 is in the region R < Rc (see the inset
of figure 1), suggesting that even the ground state of our
model Hamiltonian is, to a large extent, universal. For
example, the lowest energies follow closely the EfimovU
U
= e−2π/s0 E3b,n
. The lowest momenta
scaling relation E3b,n+1
κ0 ≈ 0.046 22/Rc and κ1 ≈ 0.002 0359/Rc imply that the
Efimov-scaling relation is obeyed even for the lowest two
states within 0.1%. The long-range binding is another essential
signature of universality. The typical interparticle distances are
much larger than the interaction range Rc , which implies that
the properties of the state are insensitive to nonuniversal shortrange physics. These properties suggest that even the lowest
state can be considered universal and of Efimov character.
To extend the description of universal physics to larger
systems, we adopt the simplest Hamiltonian that leads to the
N-body ground state with long-range binding:

of the particles and s0 ≈ 1.006 24. The divergence of
this effective potential at R → 0 leads to the unphysical
Thomas collapse [17], i.e. an infinite number of states with
energies approaching −∞. Thomas collapse is an artefact of
the zero-range interaction being modified when potentials with
finite range r0 are considered. Finite-range corrections alter
the behaviour of U (R) in regions R r0 , producing deviations
from its universal 1/R 2 behaviour and introducing a natural
regularization. These finite-range effects strongly affect
the lowest energy states, introducing important nonuniversal
corrections. To obtain the universal behaviour even for the
lowest energy states, we adopt a regularization scheme that
consists of introducing a repulsive three-body interaction
in the hyperradius. The simplest three-body interaction is
a hard wall of size Rc , i.e. V3 = ∞ for R < Rc and
0 otherwise. Thus, our hyperradial potential at unitarity

and Rij k =

The three-body force prevents the formation of tightly bound
clusters and guarantees long-range binding. This premise is
confirmed a posteriori when we analyse the pair-correlation
function of the cluster states and suggests that N-body forces
(with N > 3) are not essential for the description of universal
physics.
In equation (1), the ideal combination of interactions
would be a zero-range pseudopotential, V2 (r) = 4π a¯h2 /
m δ(r) ∂r∂ r, and a hard-wall potential of size Rc for V3 .
Numerically, however, these interaction potentials can be

hard to deal with; we need to replace them with slightly
different potentials that are better suited to the techniques
we apply. For example, the zero-range pseudopotential has
to be replaced by a finite-range potential. This finite-range
potential leads to the same two-body physics as the zero-range
pseudopotential as long as |a|

Numerical calculations. To study a system with N
6, we use a CG basis set expansion [18, 19]. In our
implementation, the eigenstates of a system are expanded in a
set of CG basis functions in which the centre of mass has been
removed, and the relative angular momentum is zero. Each
basis function is a symmetrized product of Gaussian functions,
each of which depends on one of the N (N − 1)/2 interparticle
distances. The parameters that characterize the Gaussian
functions are selected and optimized using a stochastical
variational method [19]. This optimization allows us to reach
convergence of the lowest energy states with a few hundred
(thousand) basis functions for N = 3 (N = 4, 5).
To extend our calculations to larger systems, we
implement a DMC algorithm [20]. To within statistical
uncertainties, the DMC algorithm provides the exact groundstate energy. We introduce importance sampling through a trial
wavefunction T to reduce the statistical uncertainty. The trial
wavefunction is first optimized using variational Monte Carlo
(VMC) methods. To describe the weakly bound cluster states,
we propose the trial wavefunction

cluster energies given by N . The symbols represent the
Monte Carlo results, while the solid curves correspond to
other predictions. For N = 3, the curve corresponds to
the semi-analytical prediction of [16]. For N = 4, the
curve corresponds to predictions from [6]. For N = 5,
we carry out CG calculations for the model Hamiltonian.
The good agreement in N = 3–5 comparisons represents
strong evidence of the validity of our model Hamiltonian.
The predictions from figure 2 imply that there is at least
one N-body state universally related to an Efimov state.
These states are weakly bound. For example, the trimer
energies are 105 times smaller than the typical two-body
interaction energy h
¯ 2 mr02 . Also, their energies follow a
smooth and simple dependence on κ0 a that we approximate

parameters. The dashed curves in figure 2 show the proposed
analytical expression for E6b , E7b and E8b when setting

b8 ≈ 2.50. The simple dependence of ENb suggests that, close
to unitarity, the different cluster states follow generalized Tjon
lines, i.e. their energies are linearly correlated to each other and

numerics. For example, we obtain E4b ≈ 2.66E3b

states [11]: for aNb

that the critical scattering lengths follow a simple relationship.

suggests that aNb
→ 0 when N → ∞. This prediction
implies, in agreement with previous studies [21], that there
exist large cluster states for any a < 0.
Next, we benchmark the energy relations at unitarity.
Table 1 presents the DMC energies of cluster states up to
N = 13 at unitarity. To determine these energies, we
analyse systems with Rc /r0 = 4, 5 and 8 (which is equivalent
to changing κ0 ). The reported uncertainty is estimated by
considering the dependence of the results on Rc /r0 and the
statistical uncertainty. Our predictions agree only qualitatively
with those of [13] that considers more tightly bound states and
which are more affected by nonuniversal corrections.
The CG studies allow us to analyse the existence of
excited bound states. Four-body calculations with the model
Hamiltonian predict the existence of two states whose energies
U,2
U
U
U
at unitarity are E4b
≈ 4.55E3b
and E4b
∼ 1.003E3b
in
agreement with previous studies [6, 7]. Next, we extend the
study to five particles. First, we determine the existence of
U
U
a five-body state with an energy E5b
≈ 10.4E3b
, in good
agreement with our QMC results. Also, we observe an
extremely weakly bound excited five-body state. This state
becomes more strongly bound as nonuniversal corrections
become more important, i.e. Rc /r0 → 0. We conclude that
there exists a second state that is bound or on the verge of being
bound and that, under experimental conditions, nonuniversal
corrections of the realistic interactions are going to be crucial
for ultimately determining the existence of the second fivebody states. For N = 6, we can only analyse the ground state,
but we cannot reach full convergence. However, through an
analysis of the energy dependence on the basis size and an
extrapolation to infinite basis functions, we estimate E6b ≈
18.3(3)E3b , in good agreement with the DMC predictions.
Resonant enhancement of losses produced by the presence
of a bound state at the fragmentation energy threshold has been
the key signature for identifying universal three- and four-body
physics [4, 6, 9]. This enhancement can also be a suitable path
for experimentally observing the universal physics of larger
systems. A theoretical framework for the analysis of N-body
recombination processes has been recently proposed [22]. The
critical scattering-length ratios reported in table 1 complement
that study by identifying how resonant enhancements produced
by different N-body clusters are related to each other. The
∗
∗
ratio a4b
/a3b
is in good agreement with other theoretical
∗
∗
predictions [6] and experimental results [9]. The ratio a5b
/a4b
predicts that for the Cs experiment of [9], there should be a
five-body resonant feature at about 0.6 × 410 a0 ≈ 250a0 .
The experimental results for the losses show a series of gwave Feshbach resonances in that region that prevent us from
identifying a possible five-body resonant feature.

Figure 3. Pair-correlation distributions for N = 3–6. Note that the
maximum of the pair correlation increases with N. For N = 3, 4,
circles correspond to the DMC predictions, while solid lines
correspond to other predictions (see the text). For N = 5 and 6, the
curves correspond to DMC predictions.

Finally, we analyse the structural properties of these
cluster states. Figure 3 presents the pair-correlation functions,
|δ(rij − r)| , for N = 3–6
defined as 4π r 2 P (r) =
at unitarity. In our DMC implementation, we calculate the
structural properties, P, using the mixed estimator P mixed =
2 P DMC − P VMC [20]. For N = 3, we compare the model
Hamiltonian predictions calculated with DMC (circles) with
pair-correlation results extracted from semianalytical results
(curve on top of circles, indistinguishable from the DMC
predictions). For N = 4, we compare the model Hamiltonian
predictions calculated with DMC (circles) with universal paircorrelation results extracted from [6]. We found excellent
agreement in both comparisons. The long-range binding of
the states can be deduced from the pair-correlation functions
which show that the mean interparticle distance is much larger
than the typical interaction distances r0 and Rc . For example,
the peaks of the pair correlations are at ∼7Rc (i.e. r0 ∼ 30r0 )
for the parameters used in figure 3.
In conclusion, we have combined a model Hamiltonian
with numerical techniques to construct a suitable framework
for the description of Efimov physics in many-body systems.
This model description can be extended to study systems
with different species and spin statistics. Our results present
a universal picture for bosons in the a < 0 regime and
predict a series of cluster states universally related to each
other. As a consequence of universality, the cluster states
inherit the energy and size of Efimov-scaling relationships
that control the universal three- and four-body states. Thus,
two clusters tied to two consecutive Efimov trimers would have
their energies at unitarity related by ENb,n+1 = e−2π/s0 ENb,n .
These predictions oppose the notion of an ‘N-body Efimov
effect’ [5]. Our predictions can be experimentally investigated
by analysing resonant losses in ultracold bosonic gases.
Alternatively, these cluster states can be created by loading
bosonic atoms in an optical lattice. The proposal of [23] of
creating trimers in optical lattices can be extended to larger
systems. In principle, the energies of different cluster states
can be measured as functions of a, experimentally reproducing
the results of figure 2.
