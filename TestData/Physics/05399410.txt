ilicon-based RF and microwave technology has had a dramatic impact on the
world of wireless technology. We can now access voice/data and entertainment in virtually every corner of the globe—with everything from short range
Bluetooth and WiFi networks to cellular and satellite networks—to meet different range and throughput requirements. A laptop computer without wireless
capability is unthinkable today, whereas, ten years ago, these technologies were in their
infancy. What do the next ten years hold? What gaps in wireless technology exist even today? Perhaps the most obvious missing link is between the various devices that we carry
with us, such as cellular phones or personal digital assistants (or smart phones if you prefer), digital cameras, music and video players (such as the ubiquitous iPod), laptops, and

peripherals such as external hard drives and monitors.
The case of the mobile smart phone is particularly
important since the existing wireless connectivity is
either too slow and power hungry (Bluetooth) or designed and optimized for longer ranges (WiFi). What
is missing is a wireless universal connectivity that
can support high data rates demanded by large data
rate multimedia applications. Wireless technology has
been conspicuously absent from MP3 music players
(such as Apple’s iPod), which are ideal candidates for
downloading music and video. While ultrawideband
(UWB) technology using the 3–10 GHz band promised
to fulfill these needs, it fell short in many ways, and,
today, most of the start-up companies pursuing UWB
have folded.
Now many are making the same promises about
60-GHz technology, so it is interesting to briefly
explore the similarities and differences among these
technologies. The UWB spectrum offered 7 GHz of
bandwidth in the United States, but, when you consider a global UWB solution, the bandwidth is smaller
(6–10 GHz) due to regulatory restrictions. More importantly, the allowed power transmission in this band is
severely restricted by the Part 15 spectrum emission
mask (24.3 dBm/MHz). By contrast, the maximum
transmission power in the 60-GHz band is orders of
magnitude higher. In the United States, up to 39 dBm
equivalent isotropically radiated power (EIRP) can
be transmitted (due to the oxygen absorption in this
band). Most UWB standards channelized the band
into 500-MHz chunks, which limits the power even
further, whereas most 60-GHz standards use channels
with over 1.5 GHz bandwidth. These differences translate into much higher capacity and much longer range
communication in the 60-GHz band compared to the
UWB band. This is true even after the differences in
propagation loss are taken into account. In fact, for
the same aperture, a much higher gain antenna can
be realized at 60 GHz compared to, say, 5 GHz due to
the shorter wavelength. There are also clear disadvantages to operation at 60 GHz arising from the line-ofsight (LOS) nature of the channel. Interestingly, there
are some similarities between UWB and 60 GHz in
that both require a sophisticated baseband processor
to handle the long delay spread relative to the symbol
duration, which requires equalization or orthogonal
frequency-division modulation (OFDM). Moreover,
the wideband modulation requires a very fast analogto-digital converter (over 1 GHz), which can be a big
source of power consumption if a high dynamic range
signal is digitized directly. Techniques to lower the
dynamic range of the baseband signal using mixedsignal techniques can benefit both kinds of systems.

Applications of 60 GHz

Gb/s link can enhance the modern user’s experience.

60-GHz link.
For example, the wireless LAN network today is limited to about 100 Mb/s, while the wired Ethernet cables
are operating today at 1 Gb/s and will move to higher
speeds in the near future. Many homes are converting
to an optical connection which will offer high bandwidths to homes and offices, and users will demand a
similar performance boost in their networks.
One of the most exciting applications for UWB
technology was a wireless USB-like connection. The
ubiquity and simplicity of USB has transformed the
computer industry. Users today buy peripherals and
connect them to their PCs without having to worry
about making the right connection. This is an example
of a great success story in the PC industry. If we can
similarly deliver a wireless USB-like connection with
60 GHz, the flexibility and ease of use will enhance
the experience even further. Once users become accustomed to an untethered USB experience, there will be
no turning back to cables.
While existing applications will benefit from the
higher speeds offered by 60 GHz, there are many
emerging applications that will fundamentally change
the way we use technology. Consider the hypothetical 60-GHz-enabled iPhone, shown in Figure 2, which
could use the 60-GHz connection to download movies from a kiosk (perhaps at a train station or airport),
transmit video to a larger screen for easier viewing
(wireless docking), and connect to external peripherals such as hard disks and wired and optical networks.
If such a device is realized with reasonable power consumption, we see that it can truly displace the laptop
computer for most users.
Now that analog TV has been discontinued in the
United States, many users are upgrading their television sets to flat panel high-definition television
(HDTV) screens. While the enhanced resolution and
picture quality of digital TV is an exciting step forward,
we have also taken a step backward by introducing

the amount of bandwidth and, hence, network capacity, which favors a high bandwidth solution such as
60 GHz. Moreover, the ability to send uncompressed
data from a device to a display is a great advantage
since it reduces the computational burden in video
decompression. It also solves a common problem of
dealing with encryption and incompatible codecs.

unnecessary complexity, accompanied by a rat’s nest
of cables, into the life of the end user. Each user has to
connect several devices to the TV (an antenna, a DVD
player, a game player such as an XBox or Playstation, a
DVR/cable set-top box, video cameras). As people convert to high-definition multimedia interface (HDMI),
the number of cables reduces to the number of devices,
as opposed to many setups that use component video
and audio separately. While HDMI cables are inexpensive (unfortunately many are fooled into believing that
the expensive cables are necessary and enhance quality), once a wireless solution is made available, it will be
compelling to most users. It gives users the freedom to
put devices where it is most convenient and to include
mobile devices that can stream content to the TV (mobile
phones, digital cameras, DVRs, netbooks/laptops, etc).
Just as MP3 revolutionized the Internet and the
music industry, we are now observing a similar transformation with video (and the popularity of Web sites
such as YouTube). Disappointed by the limitations of
current cable TV set-top boxes, many users are turning
to the Internet for video content (television and videos).
The Internet allows flexibility to share content and,
most importantly, to move content from one device to
another seamlessly. Many devices are vying to become
the central hub of entertainment in the home theatre
(Sony Playstation, XBox, Apple TV), but most are limited in their ability to universally play content from
any device, particularly at the high resolution offered
by HD video sources today. What is sorely lacking
is a high throughput wireless connection that works
universally with all devices. While some are trying to
use the existing 802.11abgn networks to do this, there
are fundamental issues (Shannon’s Theorem) with

Silicon technology has all but displaced gallium
arsenide (GaAs) and other technologies for RF applications in the low GHz regime. A few niche applications, such as power amplifiers, remain as a stronghold
but are also under threat by several upstarts in highvolume, low-power applications (mobile phones). For
those with faith in Moore’s law, this was an inevitable consequence in scaling. Transistors became small
enough and, consequently, fast enough to operate into
the gigahertz frequencies.
From a technology and performance perspective,
silicon is not the obvious choice for 60-GHz systems.
Many non-silicon-based III-V technology choices come
to mind that offer higher mobility and an insulating
substrate (high Q passives) and, thus, high-frequency
operation at moderately short channel lengths. Unfortunately, these technologies are expensive and have low
manufacturing yields, thus they offer limited integration possibilities. Furthermore, these processes are not
expected to scale in cost. If you believe 60 GHz is a high
volume market, as is clearly evident from the potential
applications that will enjoy 60 GHz, then silicon is in
fact the obvious choice. Moreover, in price-sensitive
consumer applications, complimentary metal-oxidesemiconductor (CMOS) is the right choice.
But CMOS technology is not without problems.
In addition to the well-known technical problems,
such as lower performance (lower surface mobility
of electrons, higher noise, lower gain, and a conductive substrate) and higher sensitivity to temperature,
there are also economic challenges facing CMOS. After
decades of unabated geometry scaling, today there is
a lot of resistance to continue due to the prohibitively
high costs (which only the microprocessor market
has been able to endure) and an exponential increase
in the leakage power of nanoscale digital circuits
(which the microprocessor industry cannot tolerate).
With the increased cost of scaled CMOS, one may wonder if there is a place for other technologies, especially
close relatives such as silicon germanium (SiGe) bipolar
CMOS (BiCMOS). Many argue that SiGe can realize the
same performance as CMOS using older lithographic
nodes, which are cheaper to manufacture. While this
is certainly true, fortunately, we have already crossed
the threshold, and today’s high-volume CMOS technologies such as the 90-nm node are capable of good
performance at 60 GHz and are beginning to reduce
in cost as the industry moves to 65 nm, 45 nm, and

power loss and reaches the receiver with an easily
identifiable angle of arrival. If a directive antenna is
employed, the antenna’s spatial selectivity reduces the
delay spread considerably (,10 ns) as signals arriving
after or before the strongest path come from different directions. A typical channel measurement using
directive antennas, performed at the the Berkeley
Wireless Research Center, is shown in Figure 4, both
in the frequency domain and the time domain. We can
clearly see that the delay spread is shorter than 10 ns,
and frequency selectivity is on the order of 100 MHz,
with fades as deep as 5 dB. In such a case, use of a
mixed-signal baseband with modest ADC resolution
is possible, and this approach has been pursued [2]
where a 1 Gb/s I/Q baseband with a complex decision
feedback equalizer (DFE) and 4-bit ADC was demonstrated with a power of 55 mW, capable of resolving up
to 32 ns of delay spread.
To overcome the high path loss and delay spread
of the 60 GHz channel, we see that high-gain (highdirectivity) antennas are necessary. Directive antennas
are usually physically large (such as a horn antenna),
and require precise alignment. For mobile applications,
sectorized antennas or phased arrays are much more
convenient, providing gain without requiring alignment by the user. Phased arrays and high-gain antennas are probably the only practical ways to enable
longer-range 60-GHz communication. Other benefits
include spatial power combining, which allows one to
reduce the transmitted power per element, which may
help to realize higher efficiencies.
Phased arrays have been an active research topic,
with many demonstrations in SiGe and CMOS [3], [4].
Most of the phased arrays demonstrated to date suffer from very high power consumption and most are
demonstrated in SiGe. The realization of a low power
large array in CMOS at 60 GHz is still an outstanding
problem to be solved.

Many research groups are actively working on siliconbased 60-GHz building blocks and full transceivers.
The research team at IBM demonstrated full transceiver
front-ends in a SiGe BiCMOS (0.13-µm) technology [5].
A block diagram of the two-chip transceiver chipset
is shown in Figure 5. A dual-conversion superheterodyne radio architecture was selected over a homodyne approach due to its lower carrier feed-through in
the transmitter and better I/Q quadrature accuracy. A

Standardization

References

There are currently many standards for 60-GHz wireless communication, including IEEE 802.15.3c [16], IEEE
802.11ad (a high-speed WLAN network) [17], the
ECMA-387 standard [18], WirelessHD [15], and the
WiGig standard [19]. Each standard is formed by a different community of potential users of the technology,
such as consumer electronics companies (WirelessHD)
versus the PC industry (WiGig). Most of the standards
are focusing on very high speed communication (1–5
Gb/s) to enable wireless HDMI replacement.
Unfortunately the process of standardization is
highly political and controversial, often to the detriment of the technology and ultimately to the consumers. This was certainly the case for UWB technology and
may have contributed to the delay of products and to
the eventual downfall of UWB. It is imperative that the
same mistakes are not made with 60 GHz. Even though
different standards are needed for different applications, interoperability between the standards is key. For
instance, a simple single carrier low range link should
be the fall-back mode for all the different 60-GHz radios.
A single carrier is preferred, even though it may have a
shorter range due to multipath effects, because it can be
easily integrated into small low-power portable devices.
This is in stark contrast to systems using OFDM, which
require high power for the ADC and digital baseband
processor (FFT operation).

Conclusion
Silicon based 60 GHz is a promising technology for
high data rate communication. Gordon Moore is best
known for his Law predicting the continued exponential growth in the number of transistors fabricated in
silicon integrated circuits. In the same paper, though, he
also predicted that someday the same trend may benefit
microwave and millimeter-wave phased arrays. Today,
with the convergence of high-speed silicon technology
and the market demands for high data rates driven by
high-definition video, 60 GHz is at the right place at
the right time. Key challenges moving forward include
power and size reduction to enable adoption in mobile
devices and interoperability between the standardization efforts to ensure a universal 60-GHz communication link, much like today’s wired USB cables. If 60 GHz
is widely deployed in consumer electronics devices, we
may have to coin a new millimeter-wave Moore’s Law.
