Abstract
This tutorial presents the most important aspects of the molecular self-probing paradigm,
which views the process of high harmonic generation as ‘a molecule being probed by one of
its own electrons’. Since the properties of the electron wavepacket acting as a probe allow a
˚
combination of attosecond and Angstr¨
om resolutions in measurements, this idea bears great
potential for the observation, and possibly control, of ultrafast quantum dynamics in molecules
at the electronic level. Theoretical as well as experimental methods and concepts at the basis
of self-probing measurements are introduced. Many of these are discussed as the example of
molecular orbital tomography.

A very instructive overview of various methods currently
developed to achieve such extreme resolutions can be found
in [2]. One of these emerged over the last few years as a
by-product of efforts to generate light pulses of attosecond
duration [3, 4] and is currently attracting tremendous attention:
the self-probing of molecules by their own electrons.
This idea is inherent to the three-step recollision model [5]
ubiquitous in strong-field physics, the field concerned with the
highly nonlinear response of matter to optical electric fields
of similar strength to atomic/molecular binding fields: (i)
the strong laser field tears a valence electron away from the
molecule through tunnel ionization. (ii) The ‘freed’ electron
is accelerated in the laser field, which soon reverses its sign to
toss the electron back. (iii) It may now happen that the laserdriven electron recollides with its parent ion and scatters in
different ways, such as inelastic scattering leading to, e.g., core

(ii) The whole HHG three-step process of tearing the electron
away, accelerating it and finally making it recollide and
recombine happens in only a fraction of a driving laser
field cycle; e.g. in less than 2.7 fs with the commonly used
800 nm lasers. The total duration of the electron probe
pulse is only ∼1 fs long [10]. Pushing this idea further
and splitting the electron into narrow spectral components
(quantum-mechanically, it is of course a wavepacket),
one can make use of its intrinsic chirp and devise the
chirp-encoded recollision scheme allowing for ∼0.1 fs
temporal resolution [11–15] (cf section 3.1.2). To date,
not even gigantic x-ray free-electron lasers such as LCLS
in Stanford can provide x-ray pulses with such short
durations.
(iii) The HHG process is driven by the laser field in a
fully coherent way, i.e. it happens in a macroscopic
number of molecules in the laser focus in a perfectly
synchronized way, leading to a ‘macroscopic’ light signal
from a single-molecule effect—a very pleasant situation
for experimentalists.

excitation or double ionization, or simply elastic scattering of
the electron. The idea of self-probing is now nothing more
than considering the electron–ion scattering as a probe of the
molecule. An excellent overview of self-probing based on
different scattering mechanisms can be found in [6]. Each
of these possible ‘third steps’ demands its specific theoretical
modelling.
For this tutorial, we choose to delve into only one
particular outcome of inelastic electron–ion scattering, namely
the recombination of the electron with the hole it left behind.
As a result of recombination, the kinetic energy of the
recolliding electron plus the binding energy are released
through the emission of a photon, typically in the extremeultraviolet (XUV, 10–120 eV or 0.37–4.4 atomic units (au))
or even soft x-ray (120–1200 eV or 4.4–44 au) spectral
range. This strong-field process is the so-called high harmonic
generation (HHG), discovered simultaneously in Saclay [7]
and Chicago [8] in 1987.
In the self-probing paradigm, the recolliding electron
takes the role of a probe pulse and the emitted photons that of
the signal carrying information on the molecule to the detector.
What makes this scheme particularly attractive is that this
probe pulse turns out to have a set of beautiful properties
found nowhere else in this combination.

In total, we have a probe electron wavepacket (EWP)
composed of wavelengths of typical molecular dimensions
˚ and with a duration similar to intra-molecular electron
(∼1 A)
dynamics (∼1 fs or less) or very rapid nuclear dynamics, e.g. of
protons. This clearly holds promise for directly time resolving
such dynamics and probably even for ultrafast imaging of
electrons in molecules. ‘Imaging’ means obtaining structural
information of any kind—what kind, depends very strongly
on the underlying theoretical model.
Tracking ‘electrons at work’ in molecules has been a
dream of physicists for a long time because this could tackle
fundamental questions such as: when exactly is the Born–
Oppenheimer approximation valid and when does it break
down [16–19]? How does the correlated electron cloud rearrange after a fast perturbation and how long does it take?
How does this influence the subsequent slower nuclear motion?
Could we control and drive the electron re-arrangement?
When and how do correlations and couplings gain importance
in molecular dynamics? Of particular interest here will be
the migration of the electron–hole after sudden ionization of
a molecule by an attosecond light pulse or via tunnelling in
a strong infrared field [20–23], since the first experiments
related to such hole dynamics have recently been demonstrated
[13, 24] using the self-probing scheme.
Despite these encouraging achievements, we appreciate
the great difficulty of the development of reliable models for
the interaction of molecules with strong laser fields, upon
which to base the extraction of information from self-probing
experiments, and the many issues that are still open. We
will not fail to mention here the most important ‘construction
sites’ of the theories behind self-probing; a more involved
introduction to this vivid debate is attempted in [25]. We
write this tutorial because we believe that a pedagogical
overview of the ideas and concepts behind self-probing
can help many researchers with different backgrounds and
different levels of experience, who share the common goal

opportunities.

after ionization with 600 as ‘exposure time’ [24].
Vibrational and dissociative dynamics in unaligned
molecules have also been investigated with great success using
HHG in Boulder and Ottawa [45, 48, 49].
On the theory side, mainly three approaches are being
pursued: (i) tests of the applicability of the strong-field
approximation (SFA)—a well-proven model for HHG in
atoms—against numerical solutions of the time-dependent
Schr¨odinger equation (TDSE) for single-electron molecules,
mainly done in the groups of Manfred Lein in Hannover [50]
and Lars Bojer Madsen in Aarhus [51], as well as Chii-Dong
Lin’s proposal of an extension of the SFA with stationary
scattering theory, dubbed quantitative rescattering theory
[52, 53]; (ii) the solution of the 3D TDSE for various model
systems, pursued mainly in the group of Andr´e Bandrauk in
Sherbrooke [54]; (iii) a fully time-domain model developed
by Olga Smirnova, Misha Ivanov et al [13, 46], composed of
building blocks from advanced strong-field theories and proper
multi-electron wavefunctions from quantum chemistry codes.
Advances in theory play a particularly important role
for self-probing, since they not only allow us to understand
specific features of HHG spectra generated in molecules, but
also to exploit them, i.e. to retrieve information on the molecule
and its dynamics from the measured HHG spectra.

1.2. A bit of history
In this section, instead of narrating the detailed development of
the field over the last decade, we would just like to highlight
some works we consider to be seminal milestones for the
interpretation and exploitation of high harmonics generated in
molecules.
In 2000, the Imperial College group of Jon Marangos
initiated the studies of HHG in aligned molecules and
announced that it could become a tool for studying molecular
dynamics [26–29]. Shortly after, Manfred Lein achieved a
theoretical breakthrough when he described numerical results
obtained for H+2 molecules with a very simple analytical
model, demonstrating that destructive interference between the
recolliding EWP and the electron bound-state wavefunction
during the recombination step of HHG leaves a clear signature
in the harmonic emission [30, 31].
Simultaneously, the Paul Corkum group at NRC Ottawa
was the first to explicitly formulate the self-probing paradigm
in the context of non-sequential double ionization of H2
[10]. In 2004, based on the picture of the electron–
hole recombination in HHG as an interference between a
probe EWP and the bound state, they pushed the idea
of molecular imaging by self-probing to the extreme,
proposing a tomographic analysis to reconstruct the electron
bound-state wavefunction [32]. Although in this work, a
static wavefunction had been reconstructed, the potential of
ultra-fast—possibly attosecond—time resolved imaging of
electrons bound in molecules was evident. This certainly
constituted a conceptual breakthrough, although based on
controversial assumptions, and initiated a great number of
studies by both theoreticians and experimentalists.
In the following years, a lot of data was produced
around the world: the intensity of harmonics generated in
aligned molecules was shown in Italy and Japan to exhibit
spectral minima [33–35]. The connection of these minima
with intramolecular interferences was confirmed soon after by
harmonic phase measurements in Saclay, Boulder, Stanford
and Ottawa [13, 36–39]. The harmonic polarization was
also investigated and revealed surprisingly high ellipticities
[40–43]. Ingenious experimental schemes were demonstrated
to observe molecular dynamics, such as the mentioned chirpencoded recollision (cf section 3.1.2), or transient grating
spectroscopy: [44, 45] (cf section 4.6.2).
A lot of confusion was lifted around 2008 when
Olga Smirnova convinced the community that analyses of
experiments require not only to consider the highest occupied
molecular orbital (HOMO) (or the probed ion in the electronic
ground state), but also lower lying orbitals (or electronically
excited ionic states) which may play a significant role as
well, giving rise to rich (multi-)electronic dynamics within
the ion [13, 46]. First experimental indications of such multichannel contributions were observed almost simultaneously
in Stanford [47]. Based on this idea, we could interpret
our measurements performed in aligned N2 molecules and

1.3. Content of this tutorial
We will not be able to cover all contributions and approaches to
the field to everyone’s satisfaction, but this is not the aim of this
tutorial. Instead, we want to introduce newcomers and since
we explain best what we know best, we obviously will talk
more about our own work than that of colleagues. This does
not mean that we have to overly restrict the topics covered,
though. This tutorial will focus on experimental aspects, i.e.
the reader should understand what should be measured for a
certain goal and what ways there are to do so. To this end, we
will devote special attention to orbital tomography because we
feel that specifics tend to be more colourful than generalities,
i.e. even if a meaningful self-probing experiment does not
necessarily need to aim at tomographic images, this example
allows us to discuss all observables that may also serve as
input for other schemes for the extraction of information from
measurements.
A theoretical introduction is attempted in section 2. We
will treat descriptions of the HHG process with increasing
complexity: from a purely classical treatment of the electron
continuum dynamics, which shapes our probe EWP, to a
quantum mechanical description in the SFA, and also note the
crucial step from the single-molecule high-harmonic emission
to that of a macroscopic medium. Finally, we will briefly
introduce more advanced theoretical concepts relevant to a
more accurate description of HHG in molecules. Section 3
will then present some ways to decode the HHG signal based
on the models introduced before. Among others, here we
will describe the chirp-encoded recollision concept and give
a quite detailed description of molecular orbital tomography

and its requirements in the experiment, establishing a ‘todo’ list of quantities to be measured. This list will guide
through section 4, where experimental techniques will be
presented that set the proper conditions for measurements
and give access to all necessary observables. An example of
some of the experimental and theoretical concepts discussed
before will then be given in section 5, where we will describe
experiments on molecular orbital tomography. Finally, section
6 will conclude. At the beginning of the text, a list of the
abbreviations used in this tutorial—all defined somewhere in
the text but not always easy to recognize at first sight—will
help readers who are not yet familiar with the slang used in
the strong field community.

2. Theory of HHG
In a world with computing power so gigantic that we could
solve exactly the equations governing the complete dynamics
of the studied systems, we would calculate the outcome of all
experiments and the properties of our system at any instant
in time: we would conduct numerical experiments. To gain
an actual understanding of what is happening in our system,
though, we would have to do the same interpreting of the
computed results that we have to do with experimental data
today. Such ‘full simulations’ would thus merely be able to
fill up databases and some sort of subsequent data mining
could perhaps discover patterns—but very little of (human)
understanding. In some cases, turning on/off some interaction
terms might allow us to extract information on their relative
importance, but this is often not possible without affecting
the consistency of the simulations. Consequently, the exact
equations and theories will have to be simplified, i.e. models
will have to be developed in a sort of ‘top-down’ approach.
Simplified models, based on approximations of the exact
description, are thus not inferior fragments of the proper exact
theories we have to deal with due to limited computing power,
but they are at the very heart of any possible understanding of
complex phenomena.
Anyhow, the computing power available to most of us
is not sufficient to solve multi-particle dynamics in 3D space
exactly for more than a few electrons [55]. The development
of the theory behind self-probing has thus happened more
like a ‘bottom-up’ approach, starting from rather simple
models with very strong approximations—which nonetheless
had great success in describing HHG in atoms—and trying to
add refinements to them while saving the schemes to extract
information from observables. Here, we will follow the same
route: we first present the basics of HHG in atoms (sections
2.1 and 2.2) and then discuss some important aspects specific
to HHG in molecules (section 2.3).

written an excellent didactic introduction [56]. Here, we
only want to briefly grasp some basic aspects of strong-field
ionization.
For this purpose, it is always helpful to draw a
representative image. Figure 2 shows a cut along the
x-direction through the length-gauge potential5 felt by a single
active electron in a diatomic molecule, which is subjected to
a strong static electric field, E0 , pointing along the negative xdirection. One can clearly see how the strong electric field
lowers the binding potential on the positive x side and at
some finite distance, the potential falls below the binding
energy, −Ip , of the electron. The electron can thus make a
transition to the continuum by tunnelling. Its wavefunction
falls exponentially within the classically forbidden region and
the tunnelling rate, , depends on the finite amplitude at the
‘exit’ of the barrier. Since the 1960s, it is known that this rate
is [57, 58]
=

0

exp[−2(2Ip )3/2 /(3|E0 |)],

where the pre-factor, 0 , depends on the spatial structure
of the bound state. The most general derivation of this
rate for atoms has been demonstrated by Ammosov, Delone
and Krainov [59], which is why one often speaks of the
ADK rate.
For molecules, 0 will be a function of the orientation
of the laser field with respect to the molecule. Computing
this dependence is a particularly difficult task because one
needs an accurate representation of the asymptotic form of
5 As a reminder:
length gauge means a specific calibration of the
t
electrodynamic vector potential, A(t) = − −∞ E(t ) dt , such that the
interaction Hamiltonian is written HI = r·E(t), and the canonical momentum
pcan is identical to the mechanical momentum k. In velocity gauge, reached
through a unitary transformation corresponding to a gauge transformation
of A(t), the interaction Hamiltonian transforms to HI = p · A(t), and the
canonical momentum is related to the mechanical momentum of the electron
by pcan = k − A(t). Although the physics we are describing here is gauge
invariant, the length gauge has the advantage of explicitly displaying the
effective potential barrier through which the electron tunnels out.

2.1. Basic description of high harmonic generation
2.1.1. Tunnel ionization. The way a bound electron
makes a transition to the continuum when interacting nonperturbatively with a strong laser field is one of the central
elements in modelling self-probing, since it determines what
our probe EWP will look like. Ivanov and co-workers have

the molecular wavefunctions, not available from standard
quantum chemistry codes. See [60–65] for some recent
approaches to modelling tunnel ionization of molecules. These
not only aim at computing rates, but also the initial momentum
distribution of the electron ‘born’ in the continuum.
In the following, we will only focus on the dependence of
the tunnelling rate on the instantaneous electric field, which
is exponential in (1). This result, valid for static fields, can
also be used for ‘slowly’ oscillating laser fields, such that the
potential barrier does not change too much while the electron
tunnels. ‘Not too much’ is quantified via the adiabaticity
parameter, γ = ω0 2Ip /E0 , defined by Keldysh [57] as the
product of the laser frequency, ω0 , and a ‘tunnelling time’, i.e.
the time it would take for a classical particle to traverse the
barrier if the motion was classically allowed. If γ
1, the
tunnelling barrier can be considered as quasi-static and |E0 |
in (1) can simply be replaced by an oscillating |E(t)|. Then,
the exponential in (1) leads to the liberation of extremely short
electron bursts around each electric field extremum of the laser.
The other limiting case, γ
1, occurs for weak laser
fields and high frequencies, and means that ionization is
better understood as multi-photon absorption (i.e. it proceeds
‘vertically’ as shown in figure 2, as opposed to the ‘horizontal’
tunnelling) and the ionization amplitude will no longer depend
on the instantaneous laser field.
The Keldysh parameter has to be taken with some care:
it loses its sense when ω0
Ip , or as soon as one reaches a
peak laser field, E0 , so strong that it completely suppresses
the potential barrier, i.e. V (x)
−Ip everywhere on one
side. This starts to happen for a field strength |EBS | ≈ Ip2 /4,
represented in figure 2 by the dashed line. It is clear that
then, although γ might be very small, tunnelling is no longer
a relevant concept since the electron can now simply exit the
atom/molecule by moving classically over the lowered barrier.
This regime is to be avoided in HHG anyway since
due to the disappearance of the strong exponential damping
associated with tunnelling, the properties of an electron
wavepacket ‘liberated over the barrier’ will be quite different
from those of a wavepacket that has tunnelled out. In
particular, the electron will leave so quickly (for the most
part before the laser field cycle maximum) that it cannot be
driven back to recollide (see the discussion of trajectories in the
following section), thus shutting off HHG. For Ip = 0.5 au, the
barrier suppression intensity, also called saturation intensity, is
EBS 2 = 1.4×1014 W cm−2 and, from the perspective of HHG,
larger molecules with generally lower Ip can only withstand
lower laser intensities.
Typical HHG experiments take place within a parameter
region where γ does have a sense, though, and it will tell
us that we are in a somewhat grey area: for an 800 nm
laser (ω0 = 0.057), focused to an intensity of 1 ×
1014 W cm−2 (E0 = 0.053) and small molecules with
Ip ∼ 0.5 au, we find γ ≈ 1. Even with a, say, three times
longer driving wavelength, γ ≈ 0.33. In these conditions,
tunnelling acquires a non-adiabatic component, i.e. the barrier
moves during tunnelling. The effect may be imagined as
‘multi-photon absorption facilitating tunnelling’, or the tail
of the electron wavefunction being ‘vertically heated’ in the

classically forbidden region [56]. An analytic expression for
the non-adiabatic tunnelling rate in these conditions has been
derived by Yudin and Ivanov [66]. It turns out that for γ ≈ 1 it
remains a highly nonlinear function of the field modulus, only
a bit less sharply peaked than the ADK rate (1). The way the
electron born in the continuum in HHG experiments is thus
well understood in a tunnelling picture.
The laser intensity range where a tunnelling picture works
well and where HHG is experimentally feasible thus has an
upper bound of ≈EBS 2 and a lower bound of only a few times
less (due to the rapidly declining tunnelling rate and thus
HHG signal). This may seem absurdly narrow [67], especially
when compared to the range of intensities that are available
nowadays, covering many orders of magnitude [68]. It is
however the high nonlinearity of the tunnel-induced responses
obtained within that interval that makes it such a surprisingly
rich regime to investigate6 .
2.1.2. Classical. The three-step model for HHG [5] was
mentioned already in the introductory section and is—despite
its astonishing simplicity—probably the most often used
theoretical tool of strong-field physicists. Many essential
features of the HHG physics are captured and a very descriptive
framework is set which allows us to readily comprehend the
self-probing paradigm.
We call this section ‘classical’ although the model
described here includes the pure quantum effects tunnelling
and recombination. These are, however, described only
schematically as ‘sudden’ events, while the actual model is a
purely classical treatment of the continuum electron dynamics
inbetween. This will turn out to be so simple that a reader can
easily program his/her own simulations based on it and learn
a great deal by simply playing with parameters.
In the first step, at some time ti , tunnel ionization leads
to an electron being ‘born’ in the continuum7 with initially
zero velocity. From this moment on, the electron is treated
as a classical point charge and during the second step, one
considers that its evolution is completely governed by the
linearly polarized driving laser field, E(t) = xE
ˆ 0 cos(ω0 t),
with amplitude E0 and angular frequency ω0 . Although our
reasoning describes the full 3D space, it is sufficient to focus
on the laser polarization direction x for which the classical
equation of motion reads
¨
x(t)
= −E0 cos(ω0 t).

(2)

6 Note that the very convenient ‘tunnelling’ picture holds because
we implicitly express the laser–electron interaction within the dipole
approximation, as stressed e.g. in [67]. It is nevertheless a safe approach
in the intensity range that we are dealing with in this tutorial, as non-dipole
contributions become significant only far beyond the barrier suppression
threshold.
7 The electrons we are concerned with—the ones that eventually recollide
with the parent ion—are never really ionized because this would mean they
remain in the continuum after the process is over. In fact, they must
be considered quasi-bound. It is thus more precise to speak of ‘birth in
the continuum’. Nonetheless, within this tutorial, we will often speak of
‘ionization’, knowing that this is a bit sloppy.

short trajectories (solid lines) are associated, which join for
the very highest recollision energy. Electrons are born in the
continuum during the first quarter period of the driving laser.
The short trajectories then lead to recollision mainly after the
subsequent laser field extremum (i.e. after T0 /2) and electrons
with the highest return energies recollide at ≈ 0.7 T0 , i.e. close
to a zero-crossing of the driving laser field. In the last quarter
period, the long trajectories recollide.
At recollision, the electrons may recombine to the ground
state, which is the third step of the three-step model. The

which constitutes the so-called classical cut-off law. Here,
UP = E02 /4ω02 is the ponderomotive potential, i.e. the mean
quiver energy of a free electron in a laser field.
At this point, we can already learn quite a number of
things about HHG.

(for atoms and symmetric molecules) every half-cycle of
the driving laser field, i.e. the recollision direction of the
EWP switches its sign. This implies a sign change in
the molecular dipole and thus in the XUV emission. In
a spectrometer, the contributions of the individual XUV
bursts in the attosecond pulse train (APT) interfere and
one easily shows10 that due to (i), the measured spectrum
consists of harmonics of the driving laser frequency, and
due to (ii) only the odd harmonic orders are present.
Due to the laser envelope, the XUV emission has a finite
duration and this XUV envelope in the time domain leads
to a broadening of the harmonic peaks in the spectral
domain.
• From figure 3, one can infer that recollision with energies
above a certain threshold value—say, 10 eV—takes place
only during a fraction of the driving laser cycle, i.e. the
recolliding EWP is extremely short and XUV emission
takes place in short bursts. Furthermore, different spectral
components recollide at different instants: the EWP has
a chirp, which is of different sign for the short and long
trajectories.
• In (3) and (4), we can see that the laser field
amplitude/intensity acts merely as an amplitude scaling
factor on the trajectories, while the time dependence—e.g.
the recollision instant for the most energetic (‘cut-off’)
trajectory—is given by the laser frequency/wavelength
only. Thus, as the achievable recollision energies increase
linearly with laser intensity, the EWP chirp decreases
linearly. Graphically, the curves shown in the left panel
of figure 3 are stretched/compressed horizontally by an
increasing/decreasing laser intensity.

The last equation shows that not for every electron birth

ion at x = 0—the slope of the second member could
dominate the trajectory and the electron just drifts away.

determines pairs of ionization times, ti , and recollision times,
tr . Obviously, there may be several roots, i.e. recollisions, in
the trajectory corresponding to one ti . We will, however, only
consider the first one, because the continuum electron, which
quantum mechanically is of course a wavepacket, will spread
during propagation in all three dimensions9 , thus reducing
the efficiency of the subsequent recollisions. Phase matching
effects further reduce the contribution of longer trajectories to
the macroscopic signal measured in experiments [69].
For every pair (ti , tr ), the kinetic energy at recollision,

x(t

the associated electron energy at the instance of recollision.

the nucleus (cf figure 2, where x0 ≈ 10 au = 0.5 nm) at which the electron
is ‘born’. Although the electron will follow trajectories leading it only a few
nm away from its parent ion, it is not worth worrying about , since at this birth
instant, the electron has so little kinetic energy (actually, in this model none at
all) that its de Broglie wavelength is much larger than the ‘problem’ anyhow.
9 As we consider only the x-component of the electron movement with one
initial condition, this quantum spreading is not included in our description. It
can be described by launching for every birth time many trajectories with
different small initial velocities in all three dimensions and counting all
trajectories that pass through a given finite cross-section around the origin
as ‘returns’. This was done in [123].

• The driving laser frequency/wavelength has two main
effects: the recollision energy scales as ∝ ω0−2 ,
while the timing of the trajectories scales as ∝ ω0−1 .
Thus, increasing the driving laser wavelength leads to
quadratically increasing recollision energies and linearly
decreasing EWP chirp. However, it also leads to linearly
increasing continuum electron excursion durations τ =
tr − ti , which give the EWP more time to spread, thus
decreasing the recollision amplitude [70–72]. While
using longer wavelength driving lasers is the most
promising route to self-probing experiments with much
increased EWP bandwidth, this drop in HHG efficiency
represents a major difficulty. However, macroscopic
effects may help to compensate at least partly for this
drop [73–75].
• There is a clear connection/competition between HHG
and ionization.
While higher laser intensity leads
to an exponentially higher tunnelling rate and linearly
increasing recollision energy, medium saturation (i.e.
unity ionization probability already during a fraction of
the driving laser pulse) sets a strict limit on the maximum
usable intensity for HHG. This intensity not only depends
on the ionization potential (as suggested by the barrier
suppression described section 2.1.1), but also on the laser
pulse duration. The longer the pulse, the more half-cycles
add to the total ionization probability: of all electrons
born in the continuum, only a fraction recollide again,
and of these only a fraction recombines, while all others
eventually drift far away from the ion and thus properly
ionize it. This leads to the depletion of the medium
ground state as well as the creation of a free-electron gas
in the HHG medium causing considerable dispersion and
thus degrading macroscopic phase matching conditions
(cf section 4.3).

and eventually interferes with the part left in the bound state.
The simplest version of a fully quantum mechanical model
is the SFA, or Lewenstein model [76]. We will give a brief
guide through the SFA with the aim of clearly pointing out the
approximations made and how the connection to the classical
dynamics of the previous section can be recovered.
For a single active electron, the TDSE reads (in length
gauge)
i

1
∂
ψ(r, t) = − ∇ 2 + V0 (r) + r · E(t) ψ(r, t) ,
∂t
2

(5)

where E(t) is the electric field of the laser and V0 (r) represents
the interaction of the electron with the nuclei shielded by the
remaining bound electrons, which will in the following be
referred to as the core. Initially, the molecule is supposed to
be in its ground state, i.e. ψ(r, t = 0) is given by the orbital,
ψ0 (r), of our active electron in this ground state. Due to the
exponential sensitivity of the tunnelling rate (1) to the binding
energy, this will be one of the energetically highest occupied
orbitals. Note that we treat the laser field and its interaction
with the electron classically, justified by the high field strengths
considered and the associated high photon numbers per unit
volume.
Classical electro-dynamics tells us that the radiated XUV
spectrum ˜ (ω), where ω is the XUV light frequency, is given
by the Fourier transform Ft→ω of the dipole acceleration, i.e.
of the electron acceleration times its charge11 . As there is in
principle no ‘acceleration operator’ in quantum mechanics, let
us just use the double time derivative of the electron position:
˜ (ω) = Ft→ω −

where, for the time derivatives, we have used the differentiation

theorem, this can be transformed to
d
ˆ ψ = −iωFt→ω [ ψ |p|
ˆ ψ ],

˜ (ω) = Ft→ω −

(7)

Based on what was just introduced, it is now quite easy
to extend the model to more amusing laser fields synthesized
using several colour components. Since integration is a linear
functional, one can simply sum up the trajectories calculated
with (4) separately for each colour component, and then
search for recollisions. Similarly, one can easily extend
this model to two dimensions and treat laser fields with a
shaped polarization state. One may then allow for a nonzero initial velocity of the electron transverse to the tunnelling
direction (which corresponds to the lateral spread of the EWP
during its propagation) in order to find closed trajectories that
recollide with the core. The probability for such a component
does, however, drop quickly and so does the recombination
amplitude.

= Ft→ω [− ψ |−∇V (ˆr)| ψ ] = −Ft→ω [ ψ |ˆa| ψ ] ,
(8)
where we can recognize a posteriori an acceleration operator
aˆ = −∇V (ˆr), with V (ˆr) = V0 (ˆr) + rˆ · E(t). We thus find
three different ways to compute the complex XUV spectrum,
commonly referred to as ‘length’, ‘velocity’ or ‘acceleration’
form for (6), (7) and (8), respectively. At this point, all three
forms are equivalent and give the same result, irrespective of
the basis on which |ψ is represented.
The direct numerical solution of (5) is nowadays possible,
at least for atoms and simple molecules, using e.g. a
pseudo-potential for V0 (r). Suitable approximations can,
however, make possible a fully analytical solution which

2.1.3. Quantum mechanical
2.1.3.1. Strong field approximation. Instead of a classical
electron flying along a trajectory and releasing a flash of light
as it bounces back on its parent ion, the more appropriate
picture is an electron wavefunction, initially bound in an
atom or molecule, which is drastically deformed by a strong
laser field. Part of the wavefunction is pulled away from
the binding potential through the classically forbidden barrier

11

Actually, this relation, taken as ‘obvious’ until very recently, has been
challenged by [77], who rather propose that it is the dipole velocity
that directly relates to the harmonic field. This would only change
equations (6)–(8), but otherwise have no further consequences for the
equations and argumentations to follow in this tutorial.

will make it easier to shed light on the physics involved
than an interpretation of a numerical solution could. Such
an approximative solution was demonstrated by Maciej
Lewenstein and co-workers [76] shortly after the classical
three-step model was proposed. The derivation is based on
the SFA of the TDSE [57, 78], which, additionally to the
single active electron, makes the following assumptions.

Note that in (10), only bound–continuum cross-terms are
considered. Continuum–continuum transitions, which should
be very weak since a(k, t) is very small, are omitted, as is
ˆ 0 . The latter anyway vanishes
the time independent ψ0 |d|ψ
for bound states with defined parity as is the case for atoms
and symmetric molecules. We recover the three steps of the
classical approach as three factors in the integrand as follows.

(1) Of the bound states, only the field-free ground state of the
atom/molecule is considered, and all other excited bound
states are neglected.
(2) The influence of the core-potential V0 (r) on the electron
r · E(t) for
in the continuum is neglected, i.e. V0 (r)
the continuum electron.

(i) At time ti , part of the electron wavefunction makes a
transition to a continuum state with momentum k =
p + A(ti ), the transition amplitude for which is

in the expression of the amplitudes a(k, t) after the
approximate resolution of the TDSE. It contains a dipole
matrix element (DME) in length form since the operator
ˆ but comes from
here is not selected by our choice of d,
the length–gauge interaction Hamiltonian r · E(t) in the
TDSE (5).
(ii) In the continuum, the electron propagates under the
influence of the laser field only, acquiring a phase relative
to the ground state, which equals the semiclassical action

The laser field has to be sufficiently strong for the second
assumption to hold, and of sufficiently low frequency for
the first. These conditions overlap with those defining the
tunnelling regime (cf section 2.1.1). Assuming for simplicity
the ground state depletion to be negligible, we can now make
the ansatz
d3 k
a(k, t) |k ,
(9)
|ψ(t) = eiIp t |ψ0 +
(2π )3
i.e. the electron is in a superposition of states, mainly in its
bound state |ψ0 with energy −Ip , but with the small timedependent amplitudes a(k, t) also in continuum states |k
(designated by their asymptotic momenta k). The amplitudes
a(k, t) are complex valued and their phases are defined relative
to that of the stationary initial state, |ψ0 eiIp t . Introducing this
ansatz into the TDSE (5) and projecting onto |k transforms
the TDSE into an equation for a(k, t). The latter can be
solved analytically when we choose the continuum states to
be free-particle states, r|k = eik·r , i.e. assume them to be
eigenstates of the truncated Hamiltonian with V0 (r) omitted12
(cf assumption 2). Having found a(k, t), we can write the
time-dependent electron wavefunction ψ(r, t) which contains
the complete information about the system. The detailed
derivation can be found in the original paper [76] treating
atoms, or with a focus on molecules, e.g., in [79].

the only term in (10) depending on the choice for d.
Since the time propagation within the SFA is not
rigorously consistent with the system’s Hamiltonian, the length
(6), velocity (7) and acceleration forms (8) of the radiating
dipole are no longer equivalent and one cannot say which of
the three is a priori the best choice. For a long time, it was
the length form, i.e. (6), that was used almost exclusively,
including Lewenstein’s seminal paper [76]. While one can
find arguments to prefer one form or the other—Gordon et al
[80] argue in favour of the acceleration form, whereas Chiril˘a
et al [81] showed the velocity form to give reliable results—
this issue is at heart a result of the approximations made in the
SFA, of which the most severe one is certainly the plane-wave
approximation.
According to (6)–(8), the complex XUV spectrum, (ω)
is in any case proportional to the Fourier transform of (10):

to obtain the radiated electric field, one has to take twice the
real part of Fω→t [ (ω)].13
Equation (14) is an integral over infinitely many quantum
paths, i.e. triplets of drift momentum, p, ionization times,
ti , and recombination times, t, which makes its evaluation in
general very costly.
2.1.3.3. Saddle-point approximation. The quintuple integral
in (14) can be drastically simplified, and the analogy to the
classical model can at the same time be driven further, by
realizing that those contributions for which the phase
˜
S[ω,
(p, ti , t)] = ωt + S(p, ti , t)
(15)
is stationary with respect to the variables (p, ti , t) will largely
dominate, whereas a rapidly varying phase will make the
contributions of most quantum paths interfere destructively.
In analogy to the classical principle of stationary action, one
can thus find three equations, corresponding to the derivative
of S˜ with respect to the variables p, ti and t = tr , at constant ω:

dependence, i.e. time zero marks the field maximum. Full and
dashed lines correspond to the short and long trajectories,
respectively. The thin lines again show the results of the classical
calculation from figure 3.

The first pre-factor, containing the excursion duration τns , is
a result of the integration over p around the saddle point and
expresses EWP spreading, which reduces contributions from
trajectories that spend longer time in the continuum. The
second pre-factor is the result of the saddle-point integration
over both ti and tr and involves the determinant of the 2 × 2
matrix of the second derivatives of S˜ with respect to these two
variables evaluated at the saddle point. Note that the imaginary
part of the stationary action, S[(ps , tis , trs )n ], provides the ADK
tunnelling rate (1) accounting for the first step of the HHG
process [56, 84].
A detailed derivation and discussion of the saddle-point
approximation refined for HHG in molecules can be found in
[79, 85, 86]. This includes additional quantum trajectories in
which the active electron is ionized at one atomic center within
the molecule and recombines at another.
Note that it is the saddle-point approximation that
ultimately gives a physical meaning to the individual DMEs
rather than to the the mean value of the electron acceleration,
and through (18) associates a given radiated frequency with
an electron scattering wave with a well-defined energy, thus
recovering the energy conservation relation ω = k 2 /2 + Ip of
the intuitive three-step model.

Solving these three coupled equations yields triplets,
ps , tis , trs , defining saddle-point trajectories. Note that
these are complex trajectories due to tunnel ionization being
classically forbidden: (17) can only be fulfilled with purely
imaginary initial velocities. The trajectories can be visualized,
e.g., by plotting the real parts of ionization and recombination
times as a function of the XUV photon energy, shown in
figure 4—the connection to the classical trajectories is obvious.
The simple classical model turns out to be in reasonable
agreement but, obviously, the more rigorous quantummechanical calculation yields a more precise description,
notably in the cut-off region.
The saddle-point trajectories are a finite number of
quantum paths contributing to each frequency component of
the atomic/molecular dipole and thus of the XUV emission.
The different quantum paths are ordered according to the
real part of the continuum electron excursion duration, τns =

sum [82, 83]:

2.1.4. Macroscopic high harmonic emission. The XUV
light that is measured and used in experiments is obviously
not radiated by a single molecule but by an HHG medium
consisting of many emitters with a certain density profile
ρ(r). This medium interacts with a focused laser beam
with a transverse and longitudinal intensity distribution I (r).
All emitters radiate according to the local laser intensity and
the phase, laser and XUV fields propagate in a dispersive
medium. The macroscopic XUV spectrum E XUV (ω) is
obtained by solving Maxwell’s wave equation with a source
term ∝ ρ(r) (ω). This calculation corresponds essentially to

In discarding the ‘c.c.’ from (10), we discarded the negative frequency
components of the spectrum of d(t). As d(t) is a purely real-valued quantity,
this implies no loss of information at all since the spectrum of a real-valued
function has Hermitian symmetry. Also, with a spectrometer, we can only
measure positive frequency components anyway.

2.2.1. Improved description of the continuum. As shown
in section 2.1.3.3, the saddle-point resolution of the SFA
equations provides, at least in principle, a one-to-one
correspondence between individual DMEs and the spectral
components of the radiated dipole, thus conferring to the
DME the leading role in most of the interpretations and
exploitations of high harmonic spectra. Unfortunately, the
DME expressions directly inherit from the most (in)famous
yet necessary approximation of the SFA, namely the planewave approximation for the continuum. If the |k were exact
eigenstates of the laser-field-free system, the individual DMEs
in their different forms would verify14 :

where c(ω) is the light phase velocity in the dispersive HHG
medium. Interference is constructive mostly in the forward
(i.e. driving laser propagation) direction and significant
amplitude in the far field is obtained when the wave front
mismatch between the newly generated field and the phase
front of the propagating field E XUV is minimized at each point
in the medium. Much theoretical and experimental effort has
been invested into approaching this condition and studying the
effects caused by deviations from it, see e.g. [87–93].
Since for increasing n in (19), i.e. for classes of trajectories
˜
with increasing durations, the phase S[ω,
(p, ti , t)] varies more
and more rapidly with the laser intensity, phase matching is
increasingly hard to achieve. A number of studies have shown
that, consequently, the contribution of only a single trajectory
class can be retained in the macroscopic emission if phase
matching is optimized for this class (see, e.g., [94]). Then,
one term of the sum (20) will completely dominate. This is
the most important and most pleasant effect of macroscopic
phase matching: it cleans up the mess at the single-emitter
level created by the several interfering trajectory classes
contributing to each spectral component of the molecular
dipole.
In self-probing experiments, one ultimately wants to
access information on the single-molecule level. If phase
matching was perfect for the shortest trajectory class
throughout the HHG medium and for the full XUV bandwidth,
the macroscopic field, E XUV , could be considered an
‘amplified true replica’ of the single-molecule emission,
restricted to the shortest trajectory, i.e. E XUV ∝ 1 . Under
realistic conditions, it is possible to achieve very good phase
matching over a large bandwidth and, as recently shown
theoretically in [95, 96], single-emitter information can indeed
be extracted from macroscopic HHG spectra. In particular, the
XUV spectral phases measured by different groups, including
us, are generally in very good agreement with single-emitter
theory, restricted to the shortest trajectory and calculated for
some effective intensity close to the peak intensity of the
driving laser pulse [15, 97–99]—at least this can be said for
HHG in atoms where theory is well proven.
In section 4.3, we will motivate a few experimental
strategies to ensure good phase matching in the experiment. A
very instructive general review of macroscopic effects in HHG
is given by Mette Gaarde in [92].

This, however, indeed fails with free-electron states, i.e. plane
waves, confirming the plane-wave approximation as one of the
most obvious weaknesses of the SFA, which is additionally
very challenging to improve on.
This issue has been tackled in particular by Chii-Dong
Lin, Robert Lucchese and co-workers. Their quantitative
rescattering theory [52, 53] consists in improving the SFA
result by replacing the recombination DME drec (k) by the
complex conjugate of accurate photo-ionization DMEs from
elaborate stationary scattering calculations. The probability
amplitude terms for ionization and continuum propagation
are calculated with the SFA (alternatively, the molecular
ADK theory [62] is used for ionization). The results
compare well with TDSE calculations for H+2 and allow us
to reproduce many experimental results for CO2 and N2 . This
approach is based on the detailed-balance principle, stating that
photo-recombination is time-reversed photo-ionization and the
corresponding matrix elements are complex conjugates of each
other.
The applicability of detailed balance is, however,
questioned by Smirnova and Ivanov et al. As explained in
[100], matrix elements from field-free stationary scattering
theory contain, in the language of electron trajectories, also
complex multiple scattering events evolving over longer times.
These will be particularly sensitive to the strong laser field and
will probably not at all be accurately described by a fieldfree calculation. Very importantly, as seen in section 2.1.3.3,
HHG is very selective to specific quantum trajectory classes
and usually favours the shortest ones. Therefore, the very
beneficial ‘filtering’ effect of phase matching in a macroscopic
medium will likely also remove sharp continuum resonances
and complex scattering trajectories. While this intuition is
very much in favour of a simplified structure of the continuum,
implementing it in a theoretical model is very difficult and a
present field of research—see, e.g. [100, 101].
Our contribution to this effort was targeted at the influence
of the ionic potential on the phase of the recombination DME
[24]. We calculated the (length form) recombination DME,
drec (k), using for ψ0 the HOMO of N2 from a Hartree–
Fock calculation and for |k Coulomb waves, i.e. exact

(18), ω = k 2 /2 + Ip , is correct for the asymptotic electron
wavenumber far away from the core. To take into account the
increase of the electron energy as it approaches the core, one
just strikes out Ip to obtain the heuristic relation

ω = k 2 /2.

(22)

A very similar study has been done by Lein et al [102],
who calculated recombination dipoles with the H+2 bound state
and either plane waves or two-center Coulomb waves, i.e.
scattering states for the two-center Coulomb potential of H+2 .
The same differences as in our calculation were found, the
Coulomb waves lead to smoothed and slightly shifted phase
jumps.
So far our discussion of an appropriate description of
the continuum was focused on the (in)ability to use exact
continuum eigenstates |k of the system, which would be
selected by the energy conservation equation (18). Now, the
energy criterion is not sufficient to select properly the (even
exact) continuum states, as the latter are infinitely degenerate
in 3D. This raises the question of orientation, or angular
momentum, distribution of the wavepacket within a given
energy level k. The SFA with the saddle-point approximation
tells us, through (16), that the mean orientation of k must be
parallel to the laser polarization. This is what intuition tells
us too, but this information is not enough to fully characterize
the wavepacket.
One can now choose to describe the continuum EWP with
only a single k-orientation, i.e. to include only the scattering
states with asymptotic momenta parallel to the laser field.
This plus the plane-wave approximation are basic assumptions
needed for the direct information retrieval schemes discussed
in detail in section 3.3. There are, however, pathological cases
where this limitation must fail to give a reasonable description
of the EWP. When the strong field ionizes a molecule from an
antisymmetric orbital with a nodal plane parallel to the laser
field, the continuum EWP remains antisymmetric throughout
propagation and keeps the nodal plane. Such a wavepacket will
not contain any scattering states with asymptotic momenta
parallel to the field, although the mean orientation of the
momenta is indeed along this direction (this is also discussed
in [23]).
One possibility to find which k orientations/angular
momenta to include in the EWP would be again to rely on the
detailed balance principle and assume that the EWP expansion
is given by the corresponding single-photon ionization
probability amplitudes [52]. Here again, this assumption is
questionable owing to the fundamental differences between
photoionization and strong field (tunnel) ionization—sudden
and selective transition against quasistatic and laser driven
propagation, see e.g. the discussion in [103]. Reference [104]
presents a very interesting and elaborate related study, based
on the observation of a systematic shift between the spectral
position of the Cooper minimum [105] in photoionization and
HHG emission from argon atoms, explained by the particular
shape of the recolliding EWP, thus formalizing experimentally
the limitations of the detailed balance principle.

with Coulomb waves, at three different orientations θ = 0◦ , 90◦
(a) and θ = 45◦ (b), versus (asymptotic) electron momentum k. Two
values of the effective charge are considered for the Coulomb
waves: Z = 0, corresponding to plane waves (thinner, lighter lines),
and Z = 1, corresponding to the asymptotic charge of N+2 (thicker,
darker lines).

scattering states for the hydrogen atom15 . This can be seen
as a first-order improvement on the plane-wave description,
since asymptotically, the N+2 ion acts on the recolliding
electron just like a proton. Figure 5 compares the phase of
the recombination dipole resulting from this calculation to
the phase of the corresponding plane-wave dipole for three
different angles, θ , of k relative to the molecular axis. The
plane-wave dipole has a phase that is a multiple of π/2 for
all k, i.e. it is purely imaginary valued. Sudden π phase
jumps indicate sign changes. Switching to Coulomb waves
for an effective ion charge of Z = 1, the phase of the
dipole is completely ruined for k
0.8 au (corresponding
to kinetic energies
9 eV). The very rapid phase variation
at these low momenta is a direct imprint left by the Coulomb
waves, as can be seen from their partial wave expansion [17],
where each angular momentum contributes with a phase
arg[ ( + 1 + iZ/k)]. At higher momenta, including values
typical for HHG, both series of curves show similar patterns,
up to a phase shift with slow k-dependence and a translation
δk ≈ 0.4 au.
This is very good news: in particular the phase jumps,
which are a direct manifestation of spatial structure of
the HOMO (see section 3.3.3), are clearly retained in the
Coulomb-wave result. The global phase shift corresponds
to the scattering phase. The observed momentum shift of
the phase features translates to an energy shift of ≈15 eV
in the spectral region of (0.9 au
k
2 au) relevant to
most of the experiments reported so far using 800 nm driving
lasers—an energy shift that is very similar to typical bound
state energies or ionization potentials of small molecules. This
nicely corresponds to the idea that the recolliding electron, as
it approaches the core, experiences an additional acceleration
by the ionic potential [6]. The typical energy gain due to
this acceleration seems to be on the order of Ip . This is
why in the interpretation of self-probing experiments, as a
first correction for the errors introduced by the plane-wave
15 While the bound states of the hydrogen atoms are derived in virtually any
quantum physics text book, it is not so common to find the scattering states.
One text book that does treat them is [17].

For the purpose of what follows, we conclude that the
models working with a description of the continuum EWP
containing only k parallel to the laser will work only if
ionization is not along a nodal plane in the initial bound state.
For the most general case, models would have to include a far
more involved description of the EWP.

this section should be taken as a sketch of the essentials instead
of a rigorous derivation, which can instead be found in different
versions in [100, 111, 112]. The general expression for the
multi-electron recombination DME reads:

2.2.2. Multi-electron effects. The vast majority of models
in strong-field physics make use of the single-active-electron
approximation, which has given very satisfactory results for
atoms. For example, in the SFA, from the very start, i.e.
already in the ansatz (9), only one-electron wavefunctions are
considered and the only interaction treated is that between the
continuum electron and the laser field, while the remaining
electrons are assumed to be completely frozen. For molecules,
it is now frequently invoked that ‘multi-electron effects’ will
play a significant role. This refers to a rich variety of
different phenomena, all demanding involved treatment of
multi-electron dynamics, but arising essentially from two
simple facts:

where | 0 and | k are the f -electron ground and ionized
states, respectively—the latter is labelled by the released
electron’s asymptotic momentum k.
We further assume the ionized state to be factorized
ˆ + (r 1 , . . . , r f −1 )ξk (r f ),
in the form k (r 1 , . . . , r f ) = A
+
where (r 1 , . . . , r f −1 ) is the (f − 1) electron wavefunction
of the ionic core, ξk (r) = r|k is the associated
ˆ adds
continuum electron’s wavefunction, and the operator A
all antisymmetric permutations of the electron coordinates.
Note that factorizing | + and |k implies that the
continuum electron is decorrelated from the ionic core. This
approach is reasonable once the electron has reached the
continuum with a relatively high energy, but it cannot account
for the interaction of continuum electron and ionic core during
tunnel ionization or recombination. The anti-symmetry of the
total wavefunction ensures, however, that exchange correlation
is included (i.e. indistinguishability and the Pauli exclusion
principle are properly accounted for). Also, at this point, |k
is taken as an exact mean-field scattering state with energy
εk = k 2 /2, i.e. it accounts for interaction with the mean
potential due to the ionic electrons.
Using permutation antisymmetry of the wavefunctions
and the symmetry of the multi-electron dipole operator, the
recombination DME can now be written as

(i) The laser field acts on all electrons of the molecule, i.e.
also on those that remain bound. It can thus polarize
both the bound wavefunction in the neutral molecule as
well as the molecular ion [55]; and it may excite the
molecular ion on a sub-cycle time scale, changing the
electronic configuration of the ion between ionization and
recombination in HHG [43];
(ii) The electrons of the molecule, including the one being
ionized, interact among each other through Coulomb
repulsion and they are indistinguishable, i.e. they are
correlated. As an electron is being tunnel ionized, it
interacts with the remaining electrons and may thereby
electronically excite the ion [65, 106]. When the
continuum electron returns, it will again interact with the
bound electrons in the ion, possibly exciting it [100, 107].

drec = ψ D |dˆ f |k + dex .

(24)

Here, dex is an (at this point somewhat opaque) ‘exchange
correction’ term and

Since the computational cost of directly solving the TDSE
increases exponentially with the dimensionality of the
problem, such calculations are still limited to a maximum
of 2 active electrons [108]. Of the methods able to deal with
more electrons, multi-configuration time-dependent Hartree–
Fock (MCTDHF) may be the most promising one, as it fully
includes correlation but also allows to gradually ‘switch it
on and off’ by including more or fewer configurations [55,
109]. To date, strong-field theorists are just starting to gain
qualitative and quantitative understanding of multi-electron
phenomena.
Here, we shall only briefly discuss how we should adapt
the formulation of the recombination DME for multi-electron
systems, and identify the approximation which leads back to
the single active electron expression—a fair approximation
for atoms and molecules presenting little relaxation upon
ionization.
A first major step was presented in 2006
simultaneously by Patchkovskii et al [110, 111] as well as
Santra and Gordon [112] with an insightful generalization of
the SFA three-step model for HHG to multi-electron systems.
In order to keep the notation from becoming cluttered, we
leave out the spin-coordinate everywhere—the remainder of

is the Dyson-orbital—the scalar product of the multi-electron
wavefunctions of the neutral and the ionic core, where
integration runs over the first (f − 1) electron coordinates.
Calculating the Dyson orbital means projecting out the
difference between the neutral and the ionic core, which can
be seen as a hole in the ion [13, 23, 24]. For an alternative,
more general, definition of the hole (density) see [20, 21].
The exchange correction term becomes more transparent
in the Hartree–Fock framework [17, 18], where a multielectron wavefunction is expressed as a single antisymmetrized
product of orthonormal single-electron wavefunctions, i.e.
orbitals16 :
0 (r 1 , . . . , r f ) = Aψ1 (r 1 ) . . . ψf (r f )

16 A more compact way of writing this antisymmetrized product is a Slater
determinant.

Note that this implies that the scattering state |k is orthogonal
to the orbitals |φm forming the ionic core state. The exchange

is the (f − 1)-electron Hartree–Fock wavefunction of an
unrelaxed ion, obtained by simply removing an electron from
the mth orbital of the neutral molecule.
What we learn from (26) is that the exchange correction
depends on the dipole matrix elements between the actual
ion and the unrelaxed ion, as well as on the overlap of the
continuum electron state, |k , with all bound orbitals, |ψm ,
of the neutral. Knowing that |k is orthogonal to the |φm ,
which build the ion, we can conclude that if the |φm are very
similar to the |ψm , the overlap ψm |k will be very small and
the exchange terms will be negligible. In other words, the
degree of orbital relaxation upon ionization decides about the
relevance of exchange terms. See also [100] for a discussion
of the physical interpretation of exchange terms.
In Koopmans’ approximation [17, 113], i.e. neglecting
orbital relaxation upon ionization such that | + is built with
the same orbitals as the neutral but |ψf from which the
continuum electron has been ionized, the exchange terms
rigorously vanish, since |k is orthogonal to all |ψm . Also, the
Dyson orbital becomes simply ψf (r), and the multi-electron
recombination dipole (24) becomes the same as the singleactive-electron dipole (13).

nuclear part of the wavefunction of the molecular ion, which
has evolved during the excursion duration τ . The coordinate R
represents the nuclear configuration—in the H2 model system
studied in [12], this is simply the internuclear distance R.
The appearance of the overlap integral (27) can be
understood in the following way, illustrated in figure 6.
(i) As the laser ionizes the molecule, a nuclear wavepacket
is launched on the electronic (ground state) potential surface of
the molecular ion, simultaneously with the continuum EWP.
(ii) During the continuum excursion of the electron, the nuclear
wavepacket evolves as well. (iii) At recollision, the system
recombines with a certain probability into the ground state
and emits an attosecond burst of XUV light. For coherent
emission, recombination has to lead back to the initial state17 ,
the nuclear part of which is the vibrational ground state of the
neutral molecule. The probability amplitude of this transition
depends upon the overlap of the initial and evolved nuclear
wavefunctions, i.e. recombination will be all the less likely the
more different the nuclear wavefunctions have become.
This model has since been extended to more complex
molecules, such as CH4 , and it has been shown that even for
some molecules with heavier nuclei, significant modulation
of HHG may occur [129, 130]. Also, the longer the driving
laser wavelength, the longer the excursion durations, the more
time there is for the nuclei to move, and thus the stronger the
effect to be expected. With mid-IR drivers, the nuclear motion
during τ will thus in general have to be taken into account.

2.3. Aspects relevant to HHG in molecules
While the issues treated in the last section already exist for
HHG in atoms, the following discusses some aspects of HHG
in molecules, where there are nuclear degrees of freedom
and the larger spatial extent of the binding potential leads
to energetically closer lying bound states than in atoms.
2.3.1.
Nuclear dynamics. Vibrational and rotational
dynamics in molecules typically take place on the ∼100 fs
or ps time scale, respectively, which means that they are so
slow compared to the electron dynamics of the HHG process,
that nuclei are normally safely approximated as fixed. The
lightest nuclei, such as protons or deuterons, can, however, be
expected to move significantly during the continuum electron
excursion duration, τ , in HHG, with typical values of half a
driving laser period, e.g. τ ≈ 1.3 fs for an 800 nm driving
laser.
It turns out to be fairly straightforward to include nuclear
dynamics into the SFA model when the Born–Oppenheimer
(BO) approximation is adopted. Essentially, the molecular
dipole (10) is modulated by the nuclear overlap integral [12]:
C(τ ) =

χ0 (R)χ (R, τ ) dR,

2.3.2. Multi-orbital/channel contributions. Here, we remain
in the multi-electron formulation of section 2.2.2. So far,
ionization from a single orbital, ψf , has been considered—
and if we say that the orbitals ψ1 to ψf are ordered by
their energy, then we have actually just considered ionization
17 The coherence of the whole HHG process is crucial so that many molecules
in a macroscopic medium emit high harmonic radiation coherently, their
contributions adding up to a macroscopic signal. Of course, the HHG process
could, for instance, start with the molecule in the ground state and end with
a vibrationally excited molecule. This excited state would, however, have an
arbitrary phase relative to the continuum electron, which is ‘phase-locked’ to
the ground state and the light emission would consequently be incoherent and
not participate in the HHG spectrum detected in experiments.

where χ0 (R) is the nuclear part of the ground state molecular
wavefunction which is ionized in HHG, and χ (R, τ ) is the

from the HOMO. Or, in proper multi-electron terms, we have
considered the ionic wavefunction, + , to be the electronic
ground state of the ion. Due to the exponential dependence of
the tunnelling rate on Ip , this had initially been thought to give
the dominating contribution to HHG in any case. However, it
turns out that valence orbitals are energetically much closer
in molecules than in atoms, and therefore (i) the relative
contribution of energetically lower lying orbitals, referred
to as HOMO-1, HOMO-2, . . . can become significant; (ii)
ionization from the HOMO can be strongly suppressed when
the laser is polarized parallel to an orbital nodal plane, further
reducing its dominance [13, 23]; (ii) electron correlation
can lead to valence excitation of the ion during tunnelling
[65, 106]. Excited states of the ion correspond, in the
Hartree–Fock framework, to ions with an electron ‘missing’
in energetically lower lying orbitals. Such channels, usually
named after the corresponding state of the ion (A, B, . . .
for the first, second, . . . excited state) may thus indeed give
contributions that are significant compared to the X-channel
involving the ionic ground state. The different channels take
the system from the same initial to the same final state—the
neutral ground state—via different states of the ion. In the
total amplitude of the HHG process, the individual channel
amplitudes interfere.
In the multi-orbital/channel case, the f -electron state of
the ionized system, | ion is a superposition of ionic states
each with their associated continuum electron, e.g.,
|

ion (t)

bc |

+

⊗ |kc ,

i.e. a recombination DME between a continuum electron,
in state |k , and a bound ionic wavepacket formed by the
D
channel-specific Dyson-orbitals, |ψhole =
c bc ψc —a
time dependent hole in the ion. This picture provides a means
to graphically represent the wavepacket (28) and to imagine it
as a rapidly evolving hole in the ion, as done in [13, 24, 43].
Let us remind the reader, though, that this picture does not
follow easily from the rigorous DME (29) and its validity can
still be debated.
When laser-induced coupling of the channels can be
neglected, the bc are constant and the hole–wavepacket
dynamics are simply given by the free evolution of the
coherent superposition of ionic eigenstates. In the simplest
multichannel case where the superposition is restricted to two
states separated by an energy difference εc , this results in a
beating with a half period τ = π/ εc ; i.e., for εc > 2 eV,
this becomes shorter than a femtosecond and the hole density
in the ion thus moves on an attosecond timescale!
The next level of sophistication is then to include coupling
between the channels participating in HHG [43], so that the
hole in the ion is no longer evolving freely but is influenced
by the laser field or possibly by the continuum electron.

3. Decoding the HHG signal
Based on the theoretical understanding gained in section 2, we
will now proceed to discuss how information on the molecule
can be extracted from measurements of the properties of its
high harmonic emission.

where the sum runs over the participating channels c =
X, A, B, . . .. The amplitudes b(c) only contain the relative
weight of the channels, initially set by the tunnelling process
and possibly time-dependent if the channels are coupled,
e.g. by the laser. Time-dependence arises from the various
channel-dependent continuum states |kc as well as from the
ionic stationary states | c (with energies εc )—each of them
oscillating with a phase exp[−iεc t]. The recombination DME
is consequently written as a sum over channels:

3.1. Obtaining temporal resolution
3.1.1. Pump–probe with laser pulses. The most obvious way
of making a time-resolved measurement is a classical pump–
probe experiment with a first laser pulse (femtosecond IR or
even shorter XUV) initiating some dynamics in the molecule
and a second, delayed laser pulse driving HHG. The achievable
time-resolution is obviously given by the duration of both laser
pulses—in any case it will remain on the scale of a few cycles
of the IR driving laser. This clearly allows to follow fewfemtosecond dynamics by probing transient configurations
with the HHG driving pulse; as reported, e.g., for nuclear
dynamics in [40, 45, 48, 49]. Such experiments often pose
the challenge that the pump laser pulse in general launches
the dynamics only in a more or less important fraction of all
molecules contributing to HHG. It is, however, possible to
arrange for a preferential detection of the harmonic emission
from the excited species. Ways to achieve this will be
mentioned in section 4.7.

c

What does the superposition in (28) imply for our idea
of the hole in the ion?
A rigorous answer requires
analysis of the entanglement between the ionic core and the
continuum electron together with the measurement process,
which is relevant to the degree of coherence in the ion.
For a discussion of these aspects, we refer the reader to
[23, 114, 115].
An intuitive picture can be found when ignoring
entanglement and assuming the different continuum states,
|kc , to have a large overlap, so that they can be approximated
by the same average state |k for all channels. This does
not seem unreasonable for the energetically very broad EWPs
in HHG, but becomes questionable, e.g., when ionization
channels involve orbitals with opposite symmetries with
respect to the laser polarization direction [23]. Neglecting
exchange terms in the DME (29), we then find
drec (t) =

bc ψcD dˆ f |k ,

3.1.2. Sub-laser-cycle pump–probe.
3.1.2.1. Ionization-induced dynamics. Another regime of
temporal resolution is entered if one considers the three steps
of HHG as (i) pump, (ii) delay line and (iii) probe. This means
that the dynamics are launched in the ion by the ionization
process, which releases the continuum EWP for HHG. In this
case, all molecules contributing to the HHG signal undergo

do so, which is generalized to Fourier synthesis from several
colour components. To date, this technology is still in its
infancy, but it can be expected to become crucial for future
progress in self-probing. This will become even clearer when
we re-mention the potential of waveform shaping for several
other issues in the remainder of this tutorial.
Note that when including the long trajectories, e.g. by
separately analysing the XUV beam on axis (vastly dominated
by the short trajectory class) and off axis (dominated by the
long trajectory class if phase matched), the ‘length of the
attosecond movie’ can almost be doubled.

the dynamics and the experimenter has no contrast problem
at all. The pump–probe delay is set by the mean duration of
the continuum electron trajectories associated with a certain
electron energy span, and the probe pulse is the recolliding
EWP. This concept was pioneered by Niikura et al [116]
who traced the expansion of the D+2 molecular ion in its
electronic ground state immediately after ionization with ≈1 fs
resolution. In this experiment, the probe process was not
recombination and XUV emission—which is what this tutorial
shall focus on—but excitation and subsequent dissociation of
D+2 by electron impact.
If the driving laser pulse has a cosine-carrier wave, as
considered in section 2.1.2, there are two control knobs for
the pump–probe delay here: the driving laser intensity and its
carrier wavelength λ0 . Tuning the intensity only, the delay is
finely adjustable, but in very limited range only: between ≈0.4
and 0.65 laser periods (see figures 3 and 4). Niikura et al thus
used four different driver wavelengths between 800 nm and
1850 nm, which is possible with optical parametric amplifiers
(OPA) [117].
As for the pump-step, another ionization mechanism than
tunnelling can be imagined. It obviously has to happen
‘suddenly’ on a sub-laser-cycle timescale, so that attosecond
XUV pulses come to mind—attosecond pulse trains will work,
if the train-periodicity is a multiple of that of the laser which
drives the continuum electron dynamics. Theoretical studies
have shown that, in principle, attosecond pulse trains could be
used for controlling the first step of the HHG process [118],
but only a few experimental attemps have been done so far
[119, 120].

3.2. Indirect retrieval—making experiments and simulations
converge
When models are made more and more sophisticated, they
quickly become (at least mathematically) so complex that
one no longer finds human-friendly analytical expressions
that connect an experimentally measurable quantity (or a set
thereof) with the sought-for information on the molecule.
In order to nonetheless retrieve the information, one will
then try to reproduce measured data—at least qualitatively—
with model calculations that result from either hypotheses
on the model parameters or some sort of fitting procedure.
The central term for this way of analysing experiments
is consistency between experimental data and the model
predictions. This becomes all the more convincing, if there
is redundancy in the experimental data, i.e. if the same model
parameter set allows the reproduction of the dependences of
an experimentally measured quantity on different experimental
parameters.
One has to realize, though, that this way of retrieving
information either demands quite elaborate and accurate
ab-initio models, or sufficient a-priori knowledge about the
system under study, in order to keep the number of free
parameters at a minimum and thus avoid the ‘fitting an
elephant’-effect [127]. A very interesting general discussion of
the task of ‘extraction of physically relevant model parameters
from the measured raw data’ is part of the essay [128].

3.1.2.2. Chirp-encoded recollision. A special sub-category
of the above concept for sub-cycle pump–probe measurements
is chirp-encoded recollision [11–15]. One simply shrinks the
‘certain electron energy span’ mentioned above to a sharp
energy value and considers the excursion duration associated
with a sharp spectral component of the EWP corresponding
to the emission of a given harmonic order. When the
experimental conditions are such that the HHG emission is
strongly dominated by a single trajectory class, the inherent
chirp of the re-colliding EWP (see section 2.1.2) implies
that there is a unique mapping of the XUV frequency on
the excursion duration, i.e. on the pump–probe delay. For
example, for short electron trajectories, higher harmonic
orders are associated with longer electron excursion durations.
Each harmonic order thus provides a ‘frame for the
attosecond movie’ [13]: in a single EWP recollision, a whole
number of frames is shot for a movie lasting about half a laser
cycle. To increase the length of the movie or to move around
the instants when the frames are shot, one has to modify the
continuum electron trajectories by, e.g., changing the driving
laser wavelength or intensity [121].
This way of exerting control over the continuum electron
trajectories and thus, e.g., the excursion duration associated
with a certain return energy, can be generalized to laser
waveform shaping [122–126], i.e. the sculpting of the electricfield cycles below the envelope of ultrashort laser pulses.
Changing the carrier wavelength is one fundamental way to

3.2.1. Retrieving dynamics of systems with known (static)
spatial structure. Recent work of Smirnova, Mairesse et al
provides a first good example that will breathe some life into
the last—admittedly very abstract—paragraph. The authors
study the interference of multiple HHG channels as introduced
in section 2.3.2. Qualitative features in their experimental data,
such as the spectral position of HHG intensity minima as a
function of molecule alignment angle or driving laser intensity
(for CO2 [13]), or the harmonic orders and molecule alignment
angles where the strongest ellipticity of the harmonics is
observed (for N2 [43]), are shown to be reproduced by their
fairly elaborate model. While the spatial structure of the
involved bound and continuum states are taken as known
from theory, this agreement suggests that the model manages
to describe with good accuracy the involved multi-channel
dynamics, i.e. it gives realistic relative amplitudes and phases
of the involved channels.
There is only one parameter that is considered as more or
less free, or unknown, in the calculations: the relative phase,

ϕ, of the channels acquired during the tunnelling process.
It turns out that the measurements are only well reproduced
when this ionization phase difference is ϕ = 0 for the X- and
B-channels in the case of CO2 , whereas ϕ = π for the X- and
A-channels in N2 . This result is much more interesting than
it might seem at first sight, because ϕ decides on the shape
of the multi-channel Dyson orbital, i.e., since the channelspecific Dyson orbitals are known from theory, one now knows
the shape of the hole in the ion created by tunnel ionization!

dynamics in such more complex molecules is more involved
and computationally costly [129, 130].
The precision of the frequency–time mapping is of course
of crucial importance for extracting information from the
measured spectra. In all the above-mentioned studies, this
mapping was calculated using the classical model of section
2.1.2, assuming that the continuum electron dynamics remains
unaffected by the nuclear dynamics in the ion. We have later
confirmed this, at least partly, by measuring the recombination
times in H2 and D2 that were found very similar [131]. In [131],
we also point out that C(τ ) is a complex valued quantity and
thus also contributes a phase to the HHG amplitude [132].

3.2.2. Extracting sub-laser-cycle time-dependent nuclear
wavepackets. Another example for iterative retrieval based
on a mathematically complex modelling of the measured
quantity can be found in the work of Lein, Baker et al [11, 12].
They reconstructed the expansion of the H+2 molecular ion in
its electronic ground state immediately after ionization with
≈75 as resolution over a time window of ≈600 as.
The analysis of the experiment is based on the extended
SFA model mentioned in section 2.3.1 and the nuclear overlap
integral, C(τ ), which modulates the molecular dipole and thus
the single-molecule complex XUV spectrum. The intensity
of the macroscopic harmonic emission that is dominated
by a single trajectory class is thus proportional to |C(τ )|2 ,
which monotonically decreases with τ when the molecular
ion expands. Making use of chirp-encoded recollision, one
can now map the harmonic frequency to a pump–probe
delay τ . Since for the short trajectory, higher harmonic
frequencies are mapped onto longer τ , the harmonic spectral
intensity measured for H2 molecules thus decreases faster with
frequency than if there were no expansion of the ion.
The conceptual difficulty of how to isolate the effect of
|C(τ )|2 on the spectral intensity from all other factors shaping
the measured macroscopic harmonic spectrum is solved by
normalizing with a heavier isotope. In the BO approximation,
the electronic parts of the wavefunctions of H2 and D2
molecules are identical. Taking the ratio of the harmonic
spectral intensities measured first with D2 and then with H2
under equal conditions thus removes all the influence of this
electronic part as well as the instrument spectral response.
The measured ratio should thus be equal to |CD2 (τ )/CH2 (τ )|2 .
With D2 ’s nuclei being twice as heavy, the nuclear dynamics
will be slower, and |CD2 (τ )/CH2 (τ )|2 will be a monotonically
increasing function of τ , as long as the H+2 ion expands (the H+2
ground state is bound, i.e. the molecular ion will not dissociate
but vibrate with a half-period of ≈8 fs, and the dynamics
observed here is merely the very first initial expansion). In the
experiments, this was indeed found to be the case.
In order to retrieve the nuclear dynamics from this
measured ratio, a genetic algorithm was applied. The algorithm
iteratively finds a BO potential in which the evolution of the
nuclear wavepacket is such that |CD2 (τ )/CH2 (τ )|2 , calculated
by solving the TDSE with this BO potential, matches the
measured ratio of harmonic spectral intensities. Once the
algorithm has converged, one thus has reconstructed the timedependent nuclear wavepacket in H2 (and D2 ).
The same experiment was done for CH4 and CD4
molecules, with consistent results. The genetic algorithm
was, however, not yet applied because the treatment of nuclear

3.3. Direct retrieval
In some (rare) cases, the underlying model allows direct
calculation of the information on the molecule from measured
data. This was already the case in the last paragraph if one
was satisfied with knowing the squared ratio of nuclear overlap
integrals—it is only to get the more tangible BO potentials
and nuclear wavepackets that one finally has to resort to the
iterative retrieval. In this section, we will show how the SFA
or Lewenstein model discussed in section 2.1.3 leads to direct
retrieval schemes for electronic structure and dynamics.
3.3.1. Factorizing the HHG amplitude. A first instructive
insight can be gained from a calculation for laser field-free
conditions [79, 133, 134], i.e. we ignore where the EWP comes
from and how it got accelerated, but only consider a dipole
formed by the interference of a bound part with energy −Ip :
ψ0 (r, t) = ψ0 (r) eiIp t ,
(31)
and a continuum plane wavepacket moving along the xdirection only:
ψc (r, t) =

with complex-valued amplitudes a(k), including, e.g., a
chirp. This is analogous to the SFA-ansatz (9). Neglecting,
as discussed in connection with (10), bound–bound and
continuum–continuum matrix elements, one finds an XUV
spectrum

Obviously, the second term, which results from the complex
conjugate in the first line, stands for the negative frequency
components and we can omit it as we did in (14). For the
first term, the Dirac-δ function picks out two k-values from the
integration interval [−∞, +∞], namely k = ± 2(ω − Ip )
and we obtain:

with ω = k 2 /2 + Ip .

The complex XUV amplitude for frequency ω is thus a sum
of two terms, describing EWP recollisions with k and −k,
i.e. from opposite sides of the molecule, each of the terms
factorized into a complex EWP spectral amplitude and the
recombination DME.
Obtaining a corresponding expression from a rigorous
SFA-treatment, which includes the laser field, is possible
via the saddle point approximation. In section 2.1.3.3, we
have shown how the integrals in the full SFA expression for
the single-molecule complex XUV spectrum can be made to
collapse, to obtain a sum over (saddle-point) trajectories. We
have then argued in section 2.1.4 that phase matching in a
macroscopic medium will allow to select only one trajectory
class to dominate the macroscopic emission; i.e. the XUV
field reaching our detector will be proportional to only one
term out of the sum in (19), usually the one for the short
trajectories, n = 1. We thus conclude that with the mentioned
approximations, the expression for the measurable XUV field
factorizes into two terms: the recombination dipole matrix
element drec , and a complex continuum EWP amplitude:
α(k) = −i iτns 2

packet of plane waves with spectral amplitude α(k), i.e.
|k = exp[ik · r] in (36). The error introduced by the planewave approximation is reduced by using the heuristic relation
(22) of XUV frequency ω and electron wavenumber k.
The elephant in the room, pointed out in 2008 by Van
der Zwan et al [79, 134], is that this expression is not yet
fully factorized but a sum of two factorized terms. There
are two cases where full factorization can be obtained: (i)
Either, the Dyson orbital is (un)gerade. As orbitals can always
ˆ
ˆ − k ]∗
= [ ψ D |d|
be chosen to be real valued, ψ D |d|k
in length form. For (un-)gerade symmetry, the lengthform-DME is purely (real) imaginary valued due to the
symmetry properties of the Fourier transform, resulting in
ˆ
(ω) ∝ [α(k) − α(−k)] ψ D |d|k
for gerade and (ω) ∝
D ˆ
[α(k) + α(−k)] ψ |d|k for ungerade ψ D . For a multi-cycle
driving laser with symmetric carrier wave, one can readily
show with (35)18 , that the two EWPs re-colliding from either
side and time-delayed by half a laser period, are related by
α(−k) = ±α(k) for even/odd harmonic orders and gerade
ˆ
ψD , which finally leads to ∝ −2α(k) ψ D |d|k
for odd and
= 0 for even harmonic orders. The reader may verify by
him/herself that for ungerade orbitals, the signs of both terms
are swapped, giving the same final expression for . Using
velocity form only affects the recombination dipole, but for
the same final result. (ii) Or, recollision can be restricted to
one side of the molecule only, such that either a(k) or a(−k)
vanishes. This is possible with few-cycle driving laser pulses,
where the highest electron energies are only obtained during
a single half-cycle, or with an asymmetric laser waveform,
which can, e.g., be obtained by combining the driving laser
with its second harmonic [124]. Note that when considering
the emission of a macroscopic ensemble, the molecules will
have to be oriented in the laboratory frame in order to probe
them all from the same side (see section 4.1).
The factorization of the complex XUV spectrum in
the recombination DME and a complex continuum EWP
amplitude, the latter containing both the result of tunnelionization and the continuum EWP acceleration, was first
used—in a somewhat ad-hoc way—by Itatani et al [32] in
2004. It was later more firmly established by Le, Lin et al
[135, 136] for rare gas atoms and the simplest of all molecules,
H+2 , and provides the basis for their ‘quantitative rescattering
theory’ [52, 53], already mentioned in section 2.2.1. Another
derivation is demonstrated in [137].

(35)

The Lewenstein model thus lets us derive an expression
analogous to (34). Note that in (35), the argument k
designates the electron wavevector at the recollision instant,
k = ps + A trs , whereas in the ionization DME, the electron
wavevector at the ionization instant has to be used: k =
k + A(tis ) − A trs . Note also that in order to factor out the
recombination dipole matrix element, it is actually sufficient
to make the saddle-point approximation for the momentum, p
and the recombination time, tr , only, as shown in [79, 134].
In order not to miss the second term for the recollision
from the opposite side of the molecule, one has to be careful
of a little stumbling block. When thinking of the three steps
of the self-probing paradigm, one often thinks about a single
recollision only. This is also what we did when discussing the
solutions of the saddle-point equations (17) to (18), visualized
in figure 4: we have only considered trajectories starting in
one laser half-cycle, i.e. ti ∈ [0, T0 /2]. Though, to grasp
a valid picture, one obviously has to consider ionization
over at least a full laser period, T0 . For the most common
situation of a linearly polarized laser pulse with cosine-shaped
carrier wave, a search for saddle points will find two short
trajectories: ps , tis , trs and −ps , tis + T0 /2, trs + T0 /2 . These
correspond to the EWP recollisions with ps + A trs = k and
−ps + A(trs + T0 /2) = −ps − A trs = −k, i.e. from opposite
sides of the molecule.
Combining the factorization possible via the saddle
point approximation with our conclusions from sections 2.2.1
and 2.2.2, we can write for the measurable complex XUV
spectrum:
ˆ
ˆ −k ,
(ω) ∝ α(k) ψ D |d|k
+ α(−k) ψ D |d|
with ω = k 2 /2.

3.3.2. Measuring the recombination dipole.
3.3.2.1. Calibrating for the EWP. Suppose now, that
the conditions are such that the measurable complex XUV
spectrum (36) can indeed be simplified to a single factorized
term. If one knew the EWP amplitude α(k), measuring
amplitude, phase, and polarization state of the HHG spectrum,
(ω), would constitute a measurement of the complex vector
quantity of the recombination DME for k.

(36)

For the recombination DME, we have used the single-channel
multi-electron formulation (24) and neglected exchange terms,
which is justified whenever Koopmans’ approximation is
valid. We approximate the continuum wavefunction by a

η(θi ). This suggest the interpretation of η(θi ) as a ‘normalized
tunnelling amplitude’. Note that η(θi ) can change its sign,
which describes the ‘EWP’s memory of the phase of the orbital
lobe it was tunnelling from’—in other words: the fact of
self-probing rather than probing with an external probe (see
section 3.3.2.2). Note that, of course, the ‘absolute’ sign (or,
more generally, ‘absolute’ phase) of η(θi ) has no physical
sense since orbitals have an arbitrary absolute phase. Only
the variation with ionization angle is physical and relevant to
experiments.
Consequently, taking the ratio of the measured complex
XUV spectra of the studied molecule and the reference, the
electron wavepacket amplitudes α(k) will almost cancel out—
we only keep the scaling factor η(θi ):

Figure 7. Coordinates in the description of the scheme for
measuring the recombination DME. The two spheres mark the
nuclei of a simple linear molecule—the internuclear axis is thus
along the x-axis. This axis could as well be some other distinct axis
of a more complex molecule. The recolliding electron wavevector
k, confined to the (x, y)-plane, makes an angle θ with the
internuclear axis. The angle θ is known and can be varied since we
can align the molecule in the lab frame.

Note that we divide here by a scalar: the recombination
dipole for an atom and hence the emitted XUV field is always
polarized parallel to the electron recollision direction, and we
normalize by this component k.
Let (x, y, z) be the coordinates of the molecular reference
frame, with the internuclear axis (or any other distinct axis on
a more complicated molecule) along x. The most-polarizable
axis of molecules can be oriented in the laboratory frame (see
section 4.1), i.e. (x, y, z) can also be used for the laboratory
frame. We can arrange that the driving laser and XUV
propagation direction is along z—the EWP movement and
hence k, controlled by the laser field, are thus confined to
the x-y-plane. As long as we are using a linearly polarized
driving laser, k is simply parallel to the laser polarization
direction; otherwise the recollision direction can be calculated
or calibrated in some way (see e.g. [140] for a calibration
method). Together with the ‘energy conservation’ relation
ω = k 2 /2, the (x, y, z)-coordinates of the continuum electron
wavevector k associated with ω are thus determined. This
situation is depicted in figure 7, where the recollision angle, θ
is defined as the angle between k and the x-direction.
Representing the two measurable polarization components, x and y, of the XUV emission from the molecule by

This directly leads to a scheme, proposed by Itatani
et al [32], where α(k) is extracted from measurements in a
suitable known reference system. ‘Known’ means that the
corresponding DME can be calculated accurately, as is the
case for rare gas atoms. Dividing experimental HHG spectra
generated in different rare gases by calculated recombination
DME, Levesque et al [138] could show that the EWP
amplitude, α(k), essentially depends on the driving laser field
and the medium ground state energy, but not on the precise
structure of the ground state, except for a k-independent scaling
factor. The same conclusion was reached from theoretical
studies in atoms and molecules by Le et al [135, 136], also
including macroscopic phase matching [95]. In molecules, the
scaling factor depends on the ionization angle, θi . The latter is
defined analogously to the recollision angle (see figure 7, i.e.
as the angle between the x-axis and the electron wavevector
at the ionization instant, which is anti-parallel to the driving
laser field at that instant). The recollision and ionization angle
are linked via the continuum trajectories, and in a linearly
polarized driving laser field, θi = θ .
Thus, using a reference with the same ionization potential
as the studied molecule (so that for both media, ω corresponds
to the same continuum electron momentum k) in the same
experimental conditions (so that driving laser field and phase
matching are the same), the EWP amplitudes, α(k) can indeed
be calibrated—up to a scaling factor η(θi ). The reason for this
is easy to understand: in the ionization step, the main factor
is the ADK tunnelling rate (1) depending only on Ip and the
laser intensity. The amplitude and phase factors introduced
by the excursion in the continuum are only determined by
the laser field. This implies that the k-dependence of α(k)
is approximately the same for the reference atom and the
molecule at all angles, i.e. the tunnel ionization step acts as a
strong spatial filter (this filtering effect can be clearly shown
in models, see, e.g., [56, 60, 139]). The difference in α(k)
for the reference and the molecule at the varying angles due
to the dependence of the tunnelling amplitude on the orbital
geometry is then reduced to the k-independent scaling factor

What has to be measured/known is thus:
• the spectral intensity, (Aref (ω))2 , and phase, ϕ ref (ω), of
the XUV emission from a suitable known reference atom
(no alignment is necessary),
18

J. Phys. B: At. Mol. Opt. Phys. 44 (2011) 203001

• the spectral intensity (Amol (ω, θ ))2 , and phase,
ϕ mol (ω, θ ), of the XUV emission from the molecule,
separately for the two polarization components, and with
known recollision angle θ ,
• for the scaling factor, η(θi ), we actually do not need
to know its exact values but only its θi -dependence.
A separate dedicated experiment could measure the θi dependence of the tunnelling probability, which gives
information on η(θi )2 . However, detecting possible sign
changes will be a major problem—see the following
section for possible solutions.
Figure 8. Illustration of the ‘phase memory’ of the continuum EWP.
Shown is the HOMO of CO2 , which has πg -symmetry; blue and
orange colours indicate opposite phases. With a neutral probe, the
horizontal component of the complex XUV spectrum would have
opposite phases for the two indicated recollision directions—in
self-probing driven with a linearly polarized laser, though, no phase
change occurs between the two. This is because the EWP has
opposite phase at the two angles.

Looking at (40) and assuming that the reference DME
is a slowly varying function of k and does not contain any
rapid phase changes, we can say that the modulus of the
molecular DME is esentially given by the square root of the
ratio of harmonic intensities measured for the molecule and
the reference atom as well as by the angular dependence of the
tunnelling rate for the molecule. The phase of the molecular
DME is esentially given by the spectral phase difference of the
harmonic emission from the molecule and the reference atom,
as well as possible sign changes of η(θi ).

examples can be constructed with the separate XUV field
components, to show that any orbital nodal planes that cross
the origin of the coordinate system defined in figure 7 will
not show up in the measurable (ω) as long as θi = θ , as
illustrated in figure 8. In other words: the measured (ω) will
always look as if it was coming from a gerade orbital with
σ -symmetry.
This ‘phase memory’ of α(k) is taken into account by
defining the ionization amplitude, ηmol (θi ), as a real valued
quantity that can change signs (which is sufficient as long
as orbitals are real valued). This sign is very difficult to
measure. If the orbital symmetry is known in advance, the
same symmetry can be imposed on the DME via this sign, as
we did in [24], also discussed in section 5. In the general case,
a reliable tunnelling theory could provide us ηmol (θi ). MOADK theory [62], many-body S-matrix theory [141–143], or
the approach of [60, 61, 65] could be used for this purpose.
A purely experimental way of dealing with the ‘phase
memory’ is of course desirable.
One possibility is
measurements using polarization-shaped driving laser fields
that allow different recollision and ionization angles [123,
140, 144, 145]. Illustratively speaking, one can then take
the continuum electron from one orbital lobe and steer it
to recollide at another. Starting from this idea, generalized
schemes could be devised that probe the molecular ion
from different directions while keeping the ionization angle
approximately constant, thus approaching the situation of the
continuum EWP as an ‘external probe’. In this case, we
might as well omit the η-factors in (40). Another recently
proposed way of measuring the orbital symmetry is based
on characteristic structures in ‘high harmonic polarization
maps’ [146].

3.3.2.2. Mind the –self– in self-probing! The self-probing
paradigm may easily be misunderstood suggesting the image
of an external EWP probing the molecule.
However,
the fact that the EWP recolliding with the parent ion
is created by ‘tearing’ the outermost part of the bound
state wavefunction through a narrowed potential barrier, has
important implications. The EWP thus keeps a sort of ‘phasememory’ of the orbital lobe it originated from.
This already appears in the SFA-framework, although
it does not include an accurate description of the tunnelling
process. Take the gerade and ungerade versions of the same
2
2
Dyson orbital, i.e. ψgD and ψuD , with ψgD = ψuD , and
assume that our linearly polarized driving laser field leads to a
single recollision from one side of the molecule only. We will
compare the emitted complex XUV spectra, + (ω) and − (ω),
resulting from recollision with k and −k, respectively, which
we can achieve by simply flipping the sign of our driving laser
field. As mentioned earlier, for the gerade orbital, the length
form DME ψgD rˆ |k = − ψgD rˆ | − k , while for the ungerade
orbital ψuD rˆ |k = ψuD rˆ | − k . For both cases, we thus find

× (−E(ti ) · −k|ˆr|ψgD ) ψgD |ˆr| − k
= − + (ω).

What we can read from this example is, that for a gerade
orbital when switching to the opposite recollision direction,
we observe a π phase flip of the emitted XUV spectrum—
which is as expected: the EWP moves over the gerade orbital
in the opposite direction so the resulting dipole moment has
the opposite phase. However, for the ungerade orbital, the
same π phase flip occurs, which is simply because the created
EWP has opposite phases for both recollision directions. With
a linearly polarized laser, we can thus not directly see the
difference between a gerade and an ungerade version of an
orbital in the symmetry of the measured (ω). Similar

Note that the recombination DME in length form can be
expressed in a similar, yet more complicated form as (41).
It also presents a sign change, but not necessarily at the
same position as in velocity form, which is due to the error
introduced by using plane waves in the model (cf the discussion
of different forms of the DME in section 2.1.3).
This effect is commonly referred to as ‘two-center
interference’ and can be generalized to linear orbital
combinations that are not purely (anti-)symmetric [148]. It
is not only relevant to the simplest, homonuclear diatomic
molecules, but is a prototype for ‘structural interference’ in
general, i.e. interference structures due to the multi-center
nature of molecular orbitals. The most general formulation
of structural interference is found when recognizing the
recombination DME with the plane wave approximation as
ˆ Interference
the spatial Fourier transform, Fr→k , of ψ D d|.
thus occurs at characteristic spatial frequencies of a channelspecific (i.e. static) Dyson orbital.
In this generalized picture, it becomes clear that the
nuclear configuration of the molecule does not directly play
a role. In (41) to (43), the internuclear distance, R, only
appeared because the positions of the nuclei are natural sites
to place the basis functions when constructing a molecular
orbital. Obviously, we are free to change the way we represent
our orbitals and where to center our basis functions. In general,
the quantity R thus stands for the distance of these centers of
the molecular orbital—i.e. a purely electronic property.

Figure 9. Two-center-interference. Depending on the relative sign
of the molecular orbital at its two centers (orange dots), the
interference is either constructive or destructive when the recolliding
electron de Broglie wavelength equals the distance of the two
centers projected on the recollision direction.

Koopmans’ approximation and the X-channel dominates
HHG. Then, the recombination dipole relevant to HHG is
simply that between the continuum electron and the HOMO.
Suppose further that the HOMO can be written as an
antisymmetric combination of two atomic orbitals: ψ0 =
φ0 (r − R/2) − φ0 (r + R/2), where R is the internuclear
distance vector, making an angle θ with the driving laser
polarization direction and thus with the recolliding electron
wavevector k, as illustrated in figure 9. The recombination
DME in velocity form then reads
kR
cos θ φ0 (r)|eik·r . (41)
ψ0 | − i∇r |eik·r = 2ik sin
2
This result is simply a consequence of the Fourier shift
theorem. A sign change of the sine corresponds to destructive
quantum interference and happens for
R cos θ = nλe ,

3.3.3.2. Dynamic interference. As already mentioned in
section 2.3.2, if several channels contribute significantly to
HHG, they will interfere in the total recombination dipole.
For two different channels, the ions with energy difference ε
accumulate a phase difference φ = ετ during the electron
excursion duration, τ . Strictly speaking, the continuum
electron trajectory associated with one XUV frequency, ω,
is also not exactly the same for two different channels—so, do
we need to take another relative phase into account?
Let us use a variational approach to find the answer to
this question. We consider a single channel and calibrate our
energy axis such that the ion has zero energy—the neutral
bound state energy, −Ip , appearing in the SFA model thus
becomes the ionization potential associated with this channel.
Then, all the phase accumulated by the ionized system during
the continuum excursion is contained in the quasi-classical
action S˜ of the continuum electron, given by (15) and (12).
Within the stationary phase approximation, and for constant
ω, we find the action to change with varying ground state
energy by

where n is an integer and λe = 2π/k is the electron de
Broglie wavelength. Destructive interference thus occurs if
the recolliding electron wavelength is equal to the internuclear
distance projected on the recollision direction. The molecule
thus behaves like a two-point emitter whose emissions are
dephased due to (i) the path difference between the centers,
and (ii) the symmetry of the orbital.
If, instead, one considers a symmetric combination of
atomic orbitals, ψ0 = φ0 (r − R/2) + φ0 (r + R/2), one finds
along the same lines destructive interference for
R cos θ = n −

i.e. if half the recolliding electron wavelength is equal to the
internuclear distance projected on the recollision direction.
The latter relation together with the heuristic dispersion
relation ω = k 2 /2 predicts an interference position in the
harmonic spectrum that agrees well with that obtained from
TDSE simulations [102, 147] for H+2 .
Such destructive interference, i.e. a sign change in the
recombination DME (or, in complex representation, a DME
going through zero and changing phase by π ), should leave a
clear trace in the high harmonic spectrum of aligned molecules.
This was first observed in numerical experiments [30, 31],
where the solution of the TDSE for H+2 revealed minima in the
HHG spectral intensity and phase jumps of ≈π at the positions
predicted by equation (43).
Obviously, constructive interference occurs as well, but
does not leave such clear signatures in the observable HHG
spectrum.

does of course not change relative phases), this result also
readily tells us the phase variation for varying ion energy, i.e.
the relative phase of two channels in HHG, and thus confirms
the above expression for φ = ετ . The value of τ is that
corresponding to the saddle point found for the value of Ip
˜
around which we have linearized S—a
good value would thus
simply be the channel averaged-excursion duration.
Due to the mapping between XUV frequency, ω,
and electron excursion duration, τ , this time-dependent
interference shows up as frequency-dependent interference in
the measurable XUV spectra—just as structural interference.
The fact that by changing the driving laser field, one can change
the ω–τ -mapping and thus the spectral position of this dynamic
interference allows it to be separated from the structural
interference discussed above, which is time-independent.
This makes it possible to tease apart both types of
interference [121]. They are, however, simply two aspects
of one and the same physics: the recombination DME of
HHG results from interference of a continuum EWP and
the Dyson orbital. If multiple channels contribute, the
Dyson orbital is a time-dependent wavepacket and the spatial
structure of the wavepacket components leads to structural
interference while their relative phases lead to dynamic
interference. Both combined contain the spatial information
on the time-dependent Dyson orbital at the recollision instant.
Of course, this ‘instant’ can only be an average over the
spectral components of the continuum EWP, and the temporal
resolution will be given by the considered spectral range of the
recolliding EWP.

for one recollision angle θ yields a line of data points (shown in
black). For a linearly polarized driving laser, where θ is independent
of k, this line is straight, while the line may be bent if some sort of
polarization shaping is employed. Repeating the measurement for
more θ-values, slice per slice of Fourier space is collected. If
q ψ˜ D (x, y) has a known symmetry, one can limit the θ-range to one
quadrant and complete the Fourier space data according to this
symmetry. Note that, in principle, the points along each line will not
be equidistant since they are associated with equidistant harmonic
energies and thus k 2 /2 values.

the coordinates (kx , ky ) that all lie on a line, given by the
recollision angle, θ , and the length of the electron wavevectors,
k, of the recolliding EWP components. These are associated
with the harmonic photon energy, ω, via energy conservation:
k 2 /2 = ω. A whole spectrum of XUV frequencies, mapped
onto points (kx , ky ) consequently yields a slice through one
quadrant of Fourier space, as illustrated in figure 10. Repeating
the measurement for more θ -values, slice per slice of Fourier
space is collected until it is sufficiently well sampled. What
‘sufficiently’ means has yet to be figured out in simulations,
discussed in section 3.4.3.
The inverse 2D Fourier transform, Fk→r , applied to the
so-obtained data, thus yields q ψ˜ mol (x, y) in real space, and the
sought-for molecular orbital (projection) can be reconstructed
as
Fk→r dqL (kx , ky )
ψ˜ qD (x, y) =

q
An explicit, discretized version of this equation is given as
equation (2) in [24] (using a different notation, though).
From both DME components, x and y, i.e. parallel and
perpendicular to the molecular axis, the same orbital can
in principle be reconstructed. Due to the limited discrete
sampling in Fourier space, they will, however, most likely not
give the same result and one can define
ψ˜ D (x, y) = 12 ψ˜ xD (x, y) + ψ˜ yD (x, y)
(48)
for the reconstructed molecular orbital (projection) so that
distortions will hopefully average out.
The same scheme can be written based on the velocity form
of the recombination DME, i.e. with dˆ = −i∇r . Equation (45)
is then replaced by

dqV (k) = −i ψ D | |eik·r

3.4. Molecular orbital tomography
In the last section, it has become clear that the recombination
DME encodes the spatial structure of the Dyson orbital.
The question that immediately arises is: how to retrieve
the Dyson orbital? The key to the answer is the planewave approximation for the recolliding EWP, which makes
ˆ ik·r , a Fourier transform,
the recombination DME, ψ D (r)|d|e
Fr→k . Itatani et al [32] first made use of this fact when they
proposed a scheme for tomographic imaging of electrons in
molecules.
3.4.1. Concept. The recombination DME, d, is measurable
as described in section 3.3.2. With the same coordinates and
definitions, the q-component (q = x, y) of the matrix element
in length form is then written
dqL (k) = ψ D |q|eik·r
=

q

[ψ D (x, y, z)]∗ dz ei(kx x+ky y) dx dy. (45)

Each component of d thus contains the Fourier transform of
q ψ˜ D (x, y) = q

[ψ D (x, y, z)]∗ dz ,

(46)

i.e. q times the Dyson orbital projected onto the plane
perpendicular to the laser propagation direction. This implies
that an orbital odd in z will not contribute.
Measuring dq for one recollision angle θ thus yields data
points in Fourier space of the object q ψ˜ D (x, y)—points at

[ψ D (x, y, z)]∗ dz ei(kx x+ky y) dx dy. (49)

It follows that the orbital can be obtained via (48) using
ψ˜ qD (x, y) = Fk→r

(50)

Again, neither this nor (47) is a priori superior to the other
and they may give different results. There may, however, be
technical reasons to prefer one or the other form: if ψ˜ D has
a nodal plane containing the x- or y-axis, one will run into
numerical problems when dividing by x or y in (47).
3.4.2. Criticism. Someone who claims to be able to measure
an orbital risks to be attacked with rotten tomatoes by many
physicists and chemists who come to the defense of the
facts that quantum mechanics says that wavefunctions are not
observable, and electron orbitals are nothing but an artifact
of the independent particle approximation and do not exist in
nature.
The second objection is easy to dispel: the orbital
accessible by self-probing with HHG is the Dyson orbital,
which is uniquely (up to a global phase) defined with exact
multi-particle wavefunctions. Of course, the Dyson orbital
is also no more than a theoretical concept associated with a
certain physical process—the reader may make up his/her own
mind about the extent to which a Dyson orbital ‘exists’ and
perhaps seek advice in E Schwarz’s instructive essay [128].
As for the first objection: other than the impossibility of a
ψ-meter, i.e. an apparatus that would register a definite value
of the wavefunction of a system in a single measurement,
there is no law ruling out the possibility of inferring a
wavefunction from a set of measured data. In fact, this is
done by many physicists with great success—see e.g. [149,
150]. The fundamental question of full characterization of
waves is not restricted to quantum mechanics. For example
when characterizing laser pulses, we have no detector that
would be fast enough to directly track the electric field
oscillations. This restriction, however, does not prevent us
from using interference with a fully characterized reference
wave to recover the phase of the light field—even the carrierenvelope phase (CEP) [151, 152]. Here, we are doing the
same—our reference is the continuum EWP. Even if we did
not make the plane-wave approximation but knew the exact
scattering wavepacket and could retrieve the Dyson orbital
in some iterative procedure, the continuum EWP is, as any
quantum wavefunction, defined up to a global phase only. The
same is then always true for our retrieved Dyson orbital. This is
the only difference to retrieval procedures for ‘physical fields’,
such as the electric field of a light pulse, and this is why this
tomography scheme does not violate any quantum mechanics
principle. Again, we recommend the essay [128] for further
discussion of such ‘so called measurements’.
What is provocative about this scheme is rather the claim
to possess a fully (up to a global phase) characterized reference
wave—which we do not actually have. In fact, we approximate
the continuum EWP as a packet of plain waves. While this
approximation is certainly crude, it is accepted practice to
base the analysis of experiments on idealized models in order
to obtain a comprehensible understanding of the physics—or,
as in this case, to obtain a simple direct retrieval of information

Figure 11. (a) HOMO and (b) HOMO-1 of N2 from a Hartree–Fock
calculation, implemented in the GAMESS package [153].

from a measurement. The plane-wave approximation is
responsible for the surprisingly simple direct reconstruction
by means of an inverse Fourier transform. If one measures
a DME between two states—bound and continuum—one
cannot avoid making an educated guess about one of the
two if one wants to directly retrieve the other. In an indirect
retrieval procedure, this guess could be improved iteratively,
as sketched by Patchkovskii et al [111].
Numerical experiments that use exact scattering states and
then apply the tomographic reconstruction procedure based on
plane waves give mixed results. Van der Zwan et al [134],
who have calculated harmonic spectra by solving the singleactive-electron TDSE, tend to be optimistic and obtain very
good orbital reconstructions. Walters et al [103], on the other
hand, who use complex conjugated accurate photoionization
DMEs from a specialized quantum chemistry code, report
significant distortions of the orbitals reconstructed using
electron recollision energies typical for HHG experiments (i.e.
below, say, 100 eV). Note that this approach has the same
vulnerability as the quantitative rescattering theory, discussed
in section 2.2.1.
3.4.3.
Sampling Fourier space. The simulations to
be discussed in the following do not aim at testing the
approximations at the basis of the orbital tomography scheme
itself but rather suppose that the above model is accurate and
address the question of how precise the discrete sampling
has to be and how well we need to separate the polarization
components. This issue will be studied in an model case: we
consider the N2 molecule in the Hartree–Fock and Koopmans’
approximations, and disregard all but the X-channel. This
means that the Dyson orbital is equal to the HOMO. The N2
HOMO, shown in figure 11(a), is a good candidate for such
tests as it has very distinct features besides its σg symmetry
that can serve as a reference, such as the nodes at the nuclei
positions (at x = ±1 au) and the diamond-shaped central lobe.
We thus calculate the DME vector, d, with the Hartree–Fock
HOMO, computed with the GAMESS code package [153],
and plane waves. We do this at k-points corresponding to
the odd harmonic orders of an 800 nm laser (ω0 = 0.057 au)
with ω = k 2 /2, and an angular step θ . All simulations will
consider the length form only, i.e. the DME will be calculated
in length form and the reconstructions will be based on (47)
and (48).

parallel component, d , only.

The first question to be addressed is whether it is necessary
to measure the DME vector—i.e. to separately measure its xand y-components. This question arises because the major
component of the DME will usually be parallel to k. With
a linearly polarized driving laser, the easiest experiment will
then be to only measure the XUV polarization component
parallel to the driving laser polarization, to which k is parallel,
and then neglect the DME component perpendicular to k in the
analysis. We simulate this by projecting the computed DME
onto k, obtaining d = (k/k) · d, and then using dx = d cos θ
and dy = d sin θ . Only for very large spectral ranges like that
considered in figure 12, does this approximation induce clear
distortions. With the gigantic spectral width of harmonics 1
to 991 (i.e. k = 0.33 au to k = 10.6 au), the reconstruction is
close to perfect if the full vector DME is considered, whereas
the approximation of using only d causes the outer part of the
orbital in figure 12(a) to be more spherical than the exact N2
HOMO. For strongly restricted spectral widths, this distortion
appears as well but the one caused by limited sampling is
largely dominant.
Concerning the sampling, there are essentially two
questions to be answered: which k-range in the recombination
DME has to be taken into account for a reasonably good
reproduction of the orbital and with which density does this
range have to be sampled?
In figure 13, only d is used for the reconstructions and
θ is varied, considering only a very restricted spectral range
(harmonics 17 to 31), motivated by the experiment presented
in [24]. Between θ = 5◦ (figure 13(a)) and θ = 10◦
(figure 13(b) and, larger, in figure 15(c)), no clear difference
is visible and the principle features of the HOMO are quite
well reproduced. The distortions with respect to figure 12 are
due to the limited spectral range. For θ = 20◦ , additional
distortions appear. Zooming out from the orbitals, another
effect of the discrete sampling becomes apparent. If the
sampling of the DME were done with an equidistant grid
in k-space, the result would be a periodic repetition of the
reconstructed orbital in real space, thus imposing a certain
minimal sampling density. In the experiment, we sample
points equidistant on a k2 -scaling, along lines with an angular
step θ . This leads to the effect shown in figures 13(b),(c),
where the reconstructed orbital is repeated on the x and y axes,

(c)

the parallel component, d , of the DME only, sampling k-points

with a period inversely proportional to the sampling steps in
k-space. Due to the non-equidistant sampling, the repetitions
become smeared out more and more as the distance from the
origin increases. With θ = 20◦ , the first repetition gets
dangerously close to the actual reconstructed orbital, whereas
θ = 10◦ turns out to be sufficiently small.
We have seen above that the narrow experimental spectral
range allows the recovery of the principal structure of the
N2 HOMO. How sensitive is this to the exact position of the
narrow spectral window and how fast does the reconstruction
improve if the spectrum is enlarged? Looking at the N2
HOMO, one can already guess that there is some characteristic
spatial frequency that should be included in the k-range if the
essential shape of the orbital should be reproduced. This
frequency is k = 2π/L = 1.75 au, and corresponds to

Figure 14. Tomographic reconstructions and the slices of the DME, d , that have been used. The sampling corresponds to the odd harmonic
orders of an 800 nm laser and an angular step of θ = 10◦ . The considered harmonic range is (a) H3–H99, (b) H3–H53, (c) H7–H53 and
(d) H21–H53. Note that due the symmetry of the N2 HOMO, the corresponding length-form DME is purely imaginary valued.

the distance L ≈ 3.6 au of the two negative lobes (see
figure 11(a)). What other frequencies are important?
Figure 14 shows reconstructions using θ = 10◦ and
different spectral ranges. The reconstruction is still fairly
close to the exact HOMO using harmonics 3 to 99, which, in
comparison with figure 12(a), shows that the improvement
by including almost 900 more harmonic orders is rather
marginal—the spectral amplitudes are simply very low at those
high k-values. Note that, as expected, the DME exhibits sign
changes close to the characteristic spatial frequency mentioned
above. Cutting the highest orders further and including only
harmonics 3 to 53 leads to the disappearance of the positive
central lobe and ruins the reconstruction. It is due to the very
dominant low-frequency negative-amplitude components that
the characteristic shape of the HOMO is lost. Cutting some of
these, as done in figures 14(c),(d), quickly allows recovery of
the characteristic shape of the N2 HOMO. If one is constrained
to limit the used spectral range, it should thus be cut on the low
frequency side as well as on the high frequency side around
the characteristic spatial frequency.
Can spectra be even narrower? In our experiments,
we have so far been limited to eight harmonic orders of an
800 nm driving laser, from H17 to H31, in the difficult phase
measurements—and we have already seen in figure 13, that
these may contain sufficient information. Figure 15 shows
reconstructions using only eight odd harmonic orders. Clearly,
when the considered spatial frequencies are too low so that
the above mentioned characteristic spatial frequency is not
contained in the range and negative-amplitude components are
strongly dominating, the orbital structure is not reproduced.
Around the characteristic frequency, the exact position of the
narrow spectral window is crucial—one really has to hit the
‘sweet spot’ of the DME. Using harmonics 17 to 31 indeed
seems to be very close to this optimal situation. With only too

high frequencies which almost only contribute with positive
amplitudes, the reconstruction turns out less satisfactory again,
similar to the example in figure 14(d). It should again be
noted that these simulations are based on length-form DME
and ω = k 2 /2 is used. The conclusions drawn here can thus
only be qualitative and there is significant uncertainty in the
link of the harmonic orders considered here to those observed
in the experiment.
These simulations show that it is realistic to acquire
experimental data that contain sufficient information to recover
the shape of the active orbital beyond its essential symmetry.
When using very narrow spectra, though, tomographic
reconstruction becomes a game of chance about just hitting the
essential part of the DME. Roughly, this essential part should
contain a characteristic spatial frequency and a ‘well balanced’
amount of the positive and negative spectral amplitudes. If the
DME has the same sign all over the filtered slice, chances
are large that one simply reconstructs an object without any
particular structure other than the imposed symmetry. This
sign is of course directly related to the phase of the DME—
our observations thus underline the importance of phase
measurements.
For a reliable extraction of an a priori unknown orbital, the
used experimental spectra clearly have to be rather large. Then,
one also has to include both XUV polarization components,
k and ⊥ k—or measure an XUV polarization component
in the molecular frame, i.e. one that has always the same
orientation with respect to the molecule, not with respect to
the recollision direction. One such component in principle
already contains all information on the orbital (see (47) and
(50)).
However, even with spectral widths that are quite
challenging to achieve experimentally (although mid-IR lasers
will help in extending the harmonic spectrum considerably),

Figure 15. Tomographic reconstructions and the slices of the DME, d , that have been used. The sampling corresponds to the odd harmonic
orders of an 800 nm laser and an angular step of θ = 10◦ . The considered harmonic range is (a) H9–H23, (b) H15–H29, (c) H17–H31 and
(d) H31–H45.

For the spectral intensities, this is no problem at all since
we can measure absolute values here. We do not even need
to elaborately calibrate our spectrometer, since any instrument
response function will be divided out when normalizing by the
spectral intensity measured for the reference atom.
Phase measurements are different in the sense that there
are no ‘absolute’ phases, but only phases relative to some
reference. For the assembled Fourier space, we would like to
have only an uncertainty about a global phase, i.e. constant
for all k and θ , i.e. all measured phases should be relative to
the same reference. This could be achieved by measuring the
complete phase of the XUV light, including the CEP, for every
slice of Fourier space19 ; but to date simply no methods exist
to do so. However, all the information we really need is the
phase-change from one slice to the next and from one point
in the slice to the next—i.e. two phase derivatives. These will
mol
(ω, θ ) − ϕ ref (ω) as a
be sufficient to obtain the phase ϕx/y
function of the two parameters k and θ , or kx and ky , up to
a global constant. In section 4.6, we will discuss different
phase measurement techniques for derivatives of the phase
with respect to ω and θ , i.e. the phase change in radial and
angular direction in the Fourier space shown in figure 10.
What is left to be measured is the normalized ionization
amplitude, ηmol (θi )/ηref , which could be paraphrased as the θ dependence of the ‘intensity’ and the ‘sign’ of the recolliding
EWP. As mentioned in the end of section 3.3.2, these
issues are removed when one manages to keep the ionization
angle approximately constant (at least limit it to a relatively
small range). This will also be beneficial for experiments
where one aims at observing dynamics launched by tunnel
ionization. This dynamics would certainly not be exactly the

the reconstructions of static orbitals will probably not be
precise enough to be considered a benchmark for calculations.
In a system where a single channel dominates HHG, we
would probably always have a hard time to decide whether
a reconstruction more resembles simply a Fourier-filtered
Hartree–Fock orbital or a much more accurate simulation
based on a properly calculated Dyson orbital. On the other
hand, for the observation of dynamics, the attainable spatial
resolution should be sufficient for most cases in order to
provide useful comparison to theory—it will thus be the
temporal resolution that makes molecular orbital tomography
particularly relevant to scientific applications. An example
will be described in section 5.
3.5. Conclusion: what has to be measured?
We take tomography as the basis of our argumentation
because it demands full characterization of our observable
‘electric field of the XUV emission’ and is a very illustrative
and instructive example for discussing which information is
needed and what role it plays for the extraction of information.
For any other specific model and derived method for extracting
information, the demands might be relaxed, but of course, a
certain redundancy in the information can always help to make
the results more convincing.
For tomography, we have to measure the recombination
DME for the molecule via the observables XUV spectral
intensity and spectral phase of (at least) one polarization
component in the molecular frame, as described at the end
of section 3.3.2. A first particular difficulty comes from
the fact that we sample Fourier space ‘line by line’ and in
order to assemble the Fourier space of our Dyson orbital (see
figure 10), we need to relate those measured lines or ‘slices’.

19 Note that even then, we would keep an arbitrary global phase from the
theoretical Dyson orbital in our calculated reference DME.

In each molecule, starting from its definite |J, M -state, a
coherent wavepacket, χ (θ, φ, t), is created. The total angular
probability function, P (θ ), for the macroscopic ensemble is
then an incoherent average of coherent wavepackets over the
initial thermal distribution. The more ‘incoherence’ there
is in the total wavepacket, the less sharply it can peak in
a certain direction and hence the less good the achievable
alignment/orientation can be.
On the one hand, very high degrees of orientation
generally demand very low rotational temperature of the
molecules. On the other hand, HHG requires relatively high
(∼1017 cm−3 ) medium densities. Since very cold supersonic gas jets [158, 159] employing (several) skimmers and
possibly some means of state-selection [160] provide only
orders of magnitude lower densities, a trade-off has to be
found and the lowest temperatures are sacrificed for sufficient
molecule density. While today, in very low-density gas
samples, nearly perfect alignment and excellent degrees of
orientation can be achieved [160–163], the aforementioned
trade-off for HHG media has so far only been found for
the one-dimensional alignment of linear, symmetric top and
asymmetric top molecules [35, 164].
The non-adiabatic method used in these experiments
as well as for the demonstrations of orbital tomography
reported so far [24, 32] was pioneered by Seidemann [165]
and Rosca-Pruna and Vrakking [166]. A relatively strong
femtosecond laser pulse ‘kicks’ the molecules and creates the
rotational wavepacket, which evolves freely after the pulse has
passed. After a prompt alignment immediately after the laser
pulse, and given a certain commensurability of the rotational
eigenfrequencies in the wavepacket20 , it will regularly rephase and lead to an angular distribution effectively aligned
along the laser pulse polarization direction in field-free
conditions. Details on this rotational quantum dynamics can
be found in [133, 156, 164, 167, 168]. With this technique,
significant degrees of alignment in field-free conditions
are obtained already with rotational temperatures 100 K.
Alignment quality is commonly described by the ensembleaveraged expectation value cos2 θ = χ | cos2 θ |χ therm .
This measure approaches unity for an angular distribution
perfectly peaked along θ = 0 and π , cos2 θ = 0 for a diskshaped distribution peaked along θ = π/2, and cos2 θ = 1/3
for an isotropic distribution. Figure 17 shows results of an
example calculation for the alignment of N2 molecule in the
conditions of the experiments in [24]. The degree of alignment
can be improved by using a longer aligning pulse—the optimal
duration for N2 , e.g., is 120 fs—or a higher intensity of the
aligning pulse.
Three-dimensional alignment of more complex molecules
can be achieved, e.g., with elliptically polarized laser
pulses [169] or with series of orthogonally polarized pulses
[170, 171].
The temperature–density trade-off is drastically aggravated for the orientation of molecules for HHG.
Most orientation schemes break down for initial rotational

oriented (c) ensembles of molecules.

same for different ionization angles. If one is dealing with
symmetric orbitals, prior knowledge of their symmetry [24] or
a measurement of it [140, 145] will allow the corresponding
symmetry to be imposed on the DME.
Finally, let us remind the readers of the other experimental
conditions to be provided for an ab-initio tomographic
reconstruction of a Dyson orbital: the molecular frame has
to be held fixed in the laboratory frame, i.e. molecules have to
be oriented (for symmetric molecules, it is sufficient to align,
see section 4.1). Recollision has to be limited to one side
only (except if known symmetry can be exploited). Phasematching should be excellent throughout the measured XUV
spectral range.

4. Experimental techniques
Apart, of course, from a state-of-the-art driving laser, HHG is
experimentally fairly simple: it comes down to focusing a laser
pulse, sufficiently energetic and short to reach the required
intensity, into a gas cloud at ∼100 mbar provided either by a
cell with static pressure or by a (pulsed) gas jet. The latter
has the advantage of creating a rotationally cold gas sample
as is required for molecular alignment (see section 4.1). The
generated laser-like coherent XUV beam is then sent onto a
suitable detector downstream.
4.1. Holding the molecules in the laboratory frame
The first experimental prerequisite is to hold the molecules
in a certain orientation in the laboratory frame, where the
EWP movement directly follows the driving laser field.
Aligning and orienting molecules is a formidable experimental
challenge and an active area of research with a long history
[154–157]. As illustrated by figure 16, alignment and antialignment conventionally refer to head-on ( ) versus broadside
(↔) localization of some particular axis of a molecule,
whereas orientation refers to control of the up (↑) and down
(↓) directions of an aligned molecule.
If one wants to control the orientation of a molecule,
one wants to control the angular part, χ (θ, φ), of its
nuclear wavefunction, which is conveniently expressed in
the basis of the spherical harmonics |J, M = YJ M (θ, φ).
In order to make the probability |χ (θ, φ)|2 actually peak
in a single direction, one has to coherently populate a
wavepacket of |J, M , which is typically done via laserinduced stimulated J → J ± 2 Raman transitions. The
rotational temperature comes into play because we are dealing
with a macroscopic number of molecules in an ensemble
with a thermal (Boltzmann-)distribution of the |J, M -states.

20 This is assured for linear and symmetric top (two of the three moments of
inertia are the same) molecules, where all J-level-energies are multiples of the
J = 0-energy.

The optimal technique for an envisaged experiment has to
be chosen according to the precise requirements on orientation
(how many axes have to be fixed and is it necessary to orient
or only align them) and the particular molecular species under
study (does it have a permanent dipole moment, what are the
orbital symmetries).
In any practical application, neither alignment nor
orientation will be perfect and thus will always contribute
a certain error to self-probing measurements. Deconvolving
a known angular distribution of the molecular sample from
measured data is more complicated than one might think, but
it is in principle possible iteratively [39, 179].

4.2. Controlling the EWP trajectories
(c)

Once the molecules are held at a controlled orientation in the
laboratory frame (at least transiently, e.g. for about 100 fs
around the delay (i) in figure 17), a second, more intense laser
pulse can drive HHG in the so-prepared molecular sample. The
driving field-shape will then directly control the trajectories of
the EWP.
The laser field ponderomotive potential scales as Up ∝
I λ20 , where I is the intensity. Increasing the driver wavelength,
λ0 , from the 800 nm of Ti:Sa-based lasers towards the few
microns available from OPA, thus leads to recolliding electrons
of higher energy, ∝ λ20 at constant intensity. This will
greatly increase the sampled part of Fourier space in orbital
tomography (see section 3.4.3), but will also be important for
the study of molecules with fairly low Ip , implying rather
low saturation intensities. At the same time, the electron
trajectories become longer, the excursion duration increases
∝ λ0 and the SFA predicts the emitted XUV spectral intensity
to drop ∝ λ−3
0 (cf (19)) due to EWP spreading. Solutions of the
TDSE [71] as well as experiments [72] brought the unpleasant
−6
surprise that this scaling is even worse: ∝ λ−5
0 –λ0 . Indeed,
the increase of the cutoff results for a fixed energy interval
in an additional factor ∝ λ−2
0 [70]. However, as mentioned
earlier, macroscopic effects may help to compensate for this
drop of the single-molecule dipole [73–75]. In general though,
experiments using mid-IR drivers are much more challenging
than those with 800 nm.
In the simplest case of a linearly polarized driving laser
pulse, ionization and recollision will take place in the same
direction: that of the driving laser polarization. Rotating
the latter, or alternatively the molecules, then allows the
molecule to be probed from a range of directions. A fewcycle pulse duration or an asymmetric carrier wave generated
by the combination of several colour components can limit
the electron trajectories to one side of the molecule. The
issue already mentioned is that this procedure also varies the
ionization direction.
Multi-colour waveforms can ease some of the issues
just mentioned. For example, the ‘perfect wave’ recently
proposed by Chipperfield et al [126], is asymmetric and also
effectively limits recollision to one side of the molecule. Most
importantly, it is designed in order to maximize the recollision
energy whilst keeping the trajectories as short as possible
and thus avoids the dramatic drop in efficiency suffered

temperatures T
10 K and technological progress towards
very cold molecular samples with high densities will thus
play a pivotal role for advances in self-probing of molecules.
Given sufficiently cold gas jets, high degrees of orientation can
be obtained non-adiabatically [161] as well as adiabatically
[160, 163, 172], when the up–down symmetry of the aligning laser field is broken by a relatively weak dc electric field.
Completely field-free orientation can be obtained, e.g., by
means of impulsive excitation by an asymmetric two-colour
laser field [173–176], by terahertz half-cycle pulses [177] or
phase-locked three-colour pulses [178].

when increasing the driver wavelength. In calculations, this
waveform allowed the maximum recollision energy to be
increased by a factor 2.5 without losing any efficiency as
compared to a monochromatic driver.
As mentioned earlier, when polarization becomes part
of the control parameters of multi-colour waveform shaping,
it will be possible to vary the recollision direction whilst
keeping the ionization direction approximately constant [123,
140, 144], and thus, e.g., create the same initial ‘hole in
the ion’ for each direction from which it is probed after the
EWP excursion. The range of recollision angles over which
this will be possible with elaborate multi-colour waveforms
has yet to be determined. Kitzler et al showed numerically
that with a combination of a fundamental with its equally
strong orthogonally polarized second harmonic, the difference
between ionization and recollision angle can be as large
as 75◦ .

These data are based on [183].

Ionization is usually kept at very low level. Good phase
matching is usually confirmed by checking for a quadratic
dependence of the XUV intensity on the medium pressure.
Moreover, the recombination times (also often called emission
times) measured for atomic gases [15] are usually found to
be in very good agreement with the single-atom SFA theory
described in section 2.1.3.
The phase, S[(ps , tis , trs )n ], acquired by the continuum
EWP during its excursion (cf (19)) varies several times faster
with intensity for the long trajectories (n = 2) than for the short
ones (n = 1). This implies that the radial intensity profile of
the driving laser beam translates into an XUV phase front
curvature that is larger for the long trajectory contribution.
The different divergences thus cause the contributions of short
and long trajectories to spatially separate in the far field. In
many experiments, one selects the on-axis emission and thus
the short-trajectory contribution, which is stronger anyway if
one has optimized phase matching for it.

4.3. Achieving phase matched HHG
As mentioned in section 2.1.4, it is necessary to ensure good
phase matching in the experiment in order to obtain a strong
macroscopic signal and to be able to infer single-molecule
information from it. This means that one has to arrange
conditions that minimize the phase difference between the
propagating XUV field and the driving polarization over the
medium length.
Essentially, three contributions cause a phase mismatch
along the medium length. (i) The Gouy phase shift of
π of the driving laser as is goes through its focus [180].
(ii) The intensity dependence of the molecular dipole phase,
essentially contained in the quasi-classical action of the
continuum electron, S(p, ti , t), given by (12): this phase
varies approximately linearly with intensity [94, 98]. (iii)
The dispersion, i.e. the difference in phase velocity between
the driving laser and the XUV radiation, is dominated by the
free electrons created by ionization21 , the density of which
obviously strongly depends on the local intensity. Dispersion
and absorption from neutral molecules and ions can play a role
in long media [88, 181, 182] but can usually be neglected in
short gas jets.
Loose focusing can slow down the first two of these
variations. In addition, one can arrange that the phase
mismatch due to the intensity dependent dipole phase of the
short trajectory contribution cancels out that caused by the
Gouy phase shift at a short distance after the laser focus
[91]. Placing a rather short generation medium at this distance
thus allows perfect on-axis phase matching to be approached.
Significant ionization does, however, cause strong dispersion
that rapidly ruins any phase matching. Moreover, it depletes
the ground state of the emitters. Phase matching in an ionizing
medium becomes a highly dynamical process in both the
temporal and spatial domain. See [92] for a detailed review of
macroscopic effects in HHG.
The cold gas jets used in all self-probing experiments
provide a medium with an effective length of < 1 mm.

4.4. Polarization resolution
Experiments aiming either at characterizing amplitude and
phase of a selected polarization component of the XUV light
only [24], or at characterizing the full polarization state of
the XUV light [40–43, 184] will obviously need to contain
a polarization discriminating element—a polarizer. The
polarizing element used in all the works just cited was simply
a reflection off a bare metal mirror. As figure 18 shows, this
indeed makes a good polarizer, reflecting s-polarized light
about ten times better than p-polarized light. This polarizer
is, however, not convenient for high photon energies above
≈110 eV since the reflectivity drops below 1%. This behaviour
is the same for all metal surfaces. Moving towards grazing
incidence obviously allows much higher photon energies to
be reflected with good efficiency, but at the expense of a
decreasing extinction ratio.
For higher photon energies, either one deals with
extremely low XUV flux on the detector, or one switches
to multi-layer structures for a polarizer in reflection or
transmission [185–187].
Polarization resolution is interesting for several reasons.
We have seen in section 3.4.3 that if we use a wide spectral
range for orbital tomography, we will also need polarization

21 Note that these are not the quasi-bound continuum electrons of the three
step model, but those permanently detached from the core forming a free
electron gas in the HHG medium.

resolution. In [40], we have shown how detection of a selected
polarization component allows to greatly increase the contrast
of the detection of dynamics (see also section 4.7). In [43],
the XUV ellipticity served as the observable that is analysed
in order to evidence multi-channel dynamics in the N+2 ion.
4.5. Spectral intensity measurement
Measuring the spectral intensity, i.e. doing spectrometry
with the XUV light, is the most common measurement and
part of virtually any experiment on HHG. For self-probing
experiments, spectrometry only needs to be qualitatively
accurate, i.e. we only need to know the shape of the XUV
spectrum in arbitrary units. The only serious experimental
difficulty here is the effective suppression of background
signal due to the scattered driving IR laser light which has
many orders of magnitude higher flux than the XUV light
to be characterized. Metal foils of ∼100 nm thickness are
commonly used [188, 189] as high-pass filters that block the
IR light. Other options are grazing incidence reflections off
substrates with anti-reflection coating for the IR [190, 191], or
reflections off Si or SiC plates at Brewster’s angle for the IR
[192].
As opposed to the characterization of the XUV light
on target, i.e. on the detector, for self-probing, we want to
characterize the XUV at the source. We thus in principle need
to calibrate for the complete optical path from the source to
the detector. In data analysis schemes using normalization
by some reference, like those introduced in sections 3.2.2 and
3.3.2, the instrument response is, however, divided out anyway.
XUV intensity spectra can either be measured by
photoionizing a target gas with known cross-section in an
electron spectrometer—which is thus automatically integrated
into the phase measurement methods described in section
4.6.1—or with a grating-based XUV photon spectrometer.
Very often, these employ grazing incidence concave flat-field
gratings [193]. Due to the grazing incidence, the focusing by
these gratings is very astigmatic and the focus in the spectral
dimension (the tangential focus) lies far before the sagittal
focus. The line spacing of the grating is varied over its
surface in a way that leads to flat-field conditions, i.e. the
spectral (tangential) foci fall on a straight line for the spectral
bandwidth the grating is designed for. These two properties
lead to an image on a plane XUV detector at the distance of the
flat-field spectral focus, which gives good spectral resolution
in one dimension and at the same time the far-field spatial
profile in the perpendicular dimension. This can become very
useful, e.g. in the spatial interferometry schemes described in
section 4.6.2.
While being certainly the easiest observable to measure,
the spectral intensity is unfortunately not so easy to interpret.
The spectral intensity is also the XUV property which is most
prone to being influenced by macroscopic effects [93]. Also,
structures such as intensity minima can have several possible
origins (see, e.g., section 3.3.3 or [194]). It is thus clear that
more observables need to be measured in order to get an ascomplete-as-possible set of observations which can then be
combined to obtain a consistent physical interpretation.

the author-image and the phase of the cat-image (upper), and

Fourier modulus and the phase of the author/cat image

4.6. Spectral phase measurement
Figure 19 shows a little trick inspired by Rick Trebino (see
figure 13 of chapter 1 in [195]): when an image is created
by Fourier transforming a spectrum, it is the spectral phase
that imposes its ‘information content’ on the result. Due
to this importance, but also due to the particular difficulty
of measuring phases, we will in the following devote special
attention to several phase measurement methods for XUV light
from HHG.
4.6.1.
From attosecond pulse measurement—spectral
interferometry. Several methods have been developed for
the temporal characterization of attosecond light pulses. These
have in common that they are based on spectral interferometry
and measure the spectral phase, ϕ(ω), up to a constant, i.e.
up the CEP of the attosecond light pulses. Equivalently, one
can say that they measure the group delay, ∂ϕ/∂ω, of the light
pulses.
A method to measure ∂ϕ/∂ω has to include some means to
make different spectral components interfere with each other,
i.e. some means of creating spectrally shifted replicas. Since
it is much easier for us to spectrally shift electrons than XUV
light pulses, we start by making an ‘electron-replica’ of the
XUV pulse via photoionization22 . An IR laser field can now
be used to shift the spectral components of this electron replica
in order to implement spectral interferometry.
One such method, ‘reconstruction of attosecond beating
by interference of two-photon transitions’ (RABBIT), is
particularly easy to understand in the photon picture. It can
be applied for XUV radiation that consists of discrete odd
22 This is an idealized picture, neglecting amplitude and phase of the
transitions dipole matrix element, which induces of course a deviation from
the perfect ‘replica’ and has to be compensated for. See section 1.3.4 of [133]
for a more detailed description.

Figure 21. Scheme for HHG interferometry [13] based on two
separate HHG sources, one of which serves as phase reference. The
XUV spectrometer disperses the spectrum in the direction
perpendicular to the page and lets the beam diverge in the other
dimension so that the spatial diffraction pattern can be observed.

Figure 20. The two ionization paths leading to the same sideband in
the RABBIT scheme. An atom with ionization potential Ip is
ionized by either absorbing an XUV photon, (q + 1)ω0 , and emitting
an ω0 -photon, ω0 , or by absorbing a (q − 1)ω0 -photon and a
ω0 -photon.

group delay over ω thus leads to the XUV spectral phase,
ϕ(ω), up to an integration constant, which is nothing else but
the CEP of the XUV pulses.
For a general XUV field without the nice beneficial
spectral shape with only odd harmonics, this method can be
generalized. The photon picture, illustrated in figure 20, then
gets quite confusing. However, formulating the two-photon
ionization in the strong-field approximation instead, i.e. as a
single-XUV photon ionization followed by interaction of the
free electron with the IR laser field only, does lead to ways to
retrieve the XUV spectral phase [133, 201–203]. Then, one
can also increase the IR probe intensity if necessary as we no
longer rely on an XUV+single-IR-photon model. The most
general method recognizes the analogy of the spectrogram,
ω versus τ , where τ is scanned over the full overlap of the
XUV emission with the IR probe pulse, with the spectrograms
recorded in one of the most popular femtosecond pulse
characterization methods, ‘frequency resolved optical gating’
(FROG) (see chapter 6 of [195]). An iterative phase retrieval
algorithm can thus be used to extract the spectral phase of an
arbitrarily complex XUV pulse—again, up to the CEP. This
method has been named ‘frequency-resolved optical gating
for complete reconstruction of attosecond bursts’ (FROGCRAB) [202]. The experimental implementation is somewhat
more difficult than RABBIT since for FROG-CRAB, the τ range to be scanned is much longer, the analysed photoelectrons can only be collected from a small cone around
the probe laser polarization direction [203] and high temporal
resolution requires high IR probe intensities which quickly
create background-signal problems due to above-threshold
ionization. On the bright side, the additional effort for FROGCRAB is rewarded with its generality.
Attosecond XUV pulse measurement techniques can thus
be applied to measure ∂ϕ/∂ω for each recollision angle θ . We
performed such measurements in Saclay [24, 36].

harmonics of the driving IR laser, i.e. in the most common
situation of a multi-cycle driver pulse with symmetric carrier
wave. When ionizing atoms with this XUV spectrum and a
simultaneously present, time-delayed weak (∼1011 W cm−2 )
IR field of the same frequency, ω0 , as the driving laser, twocolour two-photon ionization pathways lead to the appearance
of spectral sidebands in the photoelectron spectrum, shifted
by one IR photon energy from the odd harmonics. As
illustrated in figure 20, the sidebands of two adjacent odd
harmonic thus overlap, i.e. the two corresponding ionization
paths, [(q + 1)ω0 − ω0 ] and [(q − 1)ω0 + ω0 ], interfere in the
sideband according to their relative phases. It is very important
that the IR probe intensity be kept very low in order to be sure
that higher order sidebands involving absorption or emission
of >1 photon are negligible.
It can be shown that the measurable intensity of sideband
q is modulated by an interference term [133, 196–198]:
Sq (τ ) = cos[2ω0 τ + ϕq+1 − ϕq−1 −

φat ],

(51)

where τ is the delay of the XUV and the weak IR pulse, ϕq±1 is
the XUV spectral phase at harmonic q ± 1, and φat is a small
correction term characteristic of the ionized atoms, which can
be accurately calculated [199]. From the phase of the 2ω0 oscillation of the sidebands in a spectrogram, i.e. a collection
of spectra for a scanned range of XUV-IR delays, one can
thus extract the phase difference for pairs of neighbouring
harmonics, which corresponds to a measurement of the group
delay, ∂ϕ/∂ω ≈ ϕ/ ω = (ϕq+1 − ϕq−1 )/2ω0 .
Now, if we determine the sideband oscillation phase by
fitting a cosine with an argument as in (51), the group delay
we find depends on how we have fixed the zero on our delay
axis and we thus determine the group delay only up to some
constant. The delay-axis-zero can be defined ‘absolutely’ with
an extension of RABBIT, where the weak IR probe beam
overlaps not only with the XUV beam in the photoelectron
spectrometer, but already with the IR driving beam in the HHG
medium [15, 200]. This will lead to a very small modulation of
the HHG driving intensity, oscillating with frequency ω0 when
the probe beam delay is scanned, and the extreme non-linearity
of the HHG process will lead to a measurable modulation
of the HHG intensity. If we now pick a delay where this
modulation is maximum and define it as τ = 0, the measured
XUV group delay is determined on a time axis where the zero
corresponds to a maximum of the driving laser field—and we
have determined an ‘absolute’ group delay. Integrating the

4.6.2. Spatial interferometry. Two methods to measure the
harmonic phase variation with the recollision angle at constant
frequency, ∂ϕ/∂θ , are HHG 2-source interferometry [13, 204]
and transient grating spectroscopy [44, 45, 205], both first used
in the context of self-probing by Mairesse et al. The basic
concept is the analysis of spatial interference of the XUV
emission originating from molecules with different angular
distributions.
HHG 2-source interferometry, schematically shown in
figure 21, is based on two spatially separated HHG sources,

the ‘thin grating’ limit and the far-field interference pattern
is given by the power-spectrum of the amplitude-and-phase
mask. If the excitation grating is sinusoidal, there are only
±first-order diffraction peaks and the analysis is simplified.
From the measured diffraction efficiency, one can then extract
the phase (and amplitude) modulation of the grating, and thus
the phase difference of the emission from excited (aligned)
and unexcited (unaligned) molecules. References [205] and
[45] (in the supplementary information) describe two different
ways of doing so.

Figure 22. Scheme for transient grating spectroscopy [44, 205]
based on HHG in a medium with an ‘excitation grating’ prepared by
two pump beams with an angle. The XUV spectrometer disperses
the spectrum in the direction perpendicular to the page and lets the
beam diverge in the other dimension so that the diffration due to the
transient grating in the HHG medium can be observed.

4.6.3. Gas mixing. A different scheme for making the XUV
emission from molecules interfere with a phase reference
relies on using a gas mixture for the HHG medium [38, 39,
210], pioneered bv Kanai et al. If the molecules under study
are mixed with, e.g., rare gas atoms in the HHG medium,
the respective XUV emissions will interfere according to
their relative phases. If the XUV spectra for the two
components of the gas mixture are known, i.e. spectra have
been measured with the pure gases under equal conditions,
then the interference term cos( ϕ) can be extracted from the
spectrum measured with a medium of known mixing ratio.
Here, ϕ is the relative phase of the XUV emissions from
the two components of the mixture. If the two components
are a molecule and a corresponding ‘reference atom’ with the
same ionization potential, then this relative phase corresponds
to the molecular recombination dipole phase up to possible
sign changes contained in the molecular ionization amplitude,
ηmol (θi ) ; see section 3.3.2. Varying the alignment/orientation
of the molecules in the mixture, which will of course leave
the reference atoms unaffected, then allows ∂ϕ/∂θ to be
measured.
Experimentally, this method requires the preparation of
a gas mixture with precisely known partial pressures, as well
as very similar phase-matching conditions between the gas
mixture and the pure gases. Finally, a very reliable and precise
measurement of XUV spectral intensities is needed.

which are phase-locked through the use of the same driving
laser. The mutual coherence of the two sources, proven in
1997 at Lund University [206], leads to a far-field spatial
interference pattern similar to Young’s double slit where the
fringe position depends on the relative phase of both sources
[206–209]. One contribution to the relative phase is of course
the delay between the two sources: for a stable interference
pattern, the delay fluctuations between the two driving IR
beams thus have to be smaller than one period of the XUV, i.e.
∼10 as. This is one of the major challenges in the experimental
implementation and can be met, e.g., in collinear schemes such
as those described in the supplementary information to [13] or
in [204].
The spatial interference pattern can be observed with
simultaneous spectral resolution by using an astigmatic flatfield XUV spectrometer (see section 4.5). One of the two
sources will provide the phase reference and in the scheme
shown in figure 21, this is simply obtained by HHG in
unaligned molecules. In the second source, some parameter
is varied, with respect to which the phase derivative is then
measured; this parameter can be the recollision direction, θ ,
e.g. controlled by a preceding aligning pulse. The spatial
fringe shift then directly gives ∂ϕ/∂θ .
Transient grating spectroscopy, schematically shown in
figure 22, is based on a grating formed by ‘excited’ molecules
in an elsewhere ‘unexcited’ HHG medium, which can be
created by crossing two pump pulses at a small angle in the
gas jet. The resulting intensity interference pattern consists of
planes separated by a grating period of λg = λL /[2 sin(β/2)],
where λL is the pump laser wavelength and β is the angle
between the two pump beams, i.e. typically, λg ∼ 10 μm.
This pump-intensity grating will prepare a corresponding
excitation-grating in the medium.
Since the ‘excitation’, in our case the alignment of the
molecules, modifies in general both the intensity and the
phase of the emitted harmonics, this constitutes an amplitude
and phase mask. While the pump-intensity-grating is purely
sinusoidal, the shape of this amplitude-and-phase mask is
purely sinusoidal only if the XUV intensity and phase depend
linearly on the excitation, which itself depends linearly on
the pump intensity. Otherwise, the mask is anharmonic. In
any case, the grating will lead to a ±first-order diffraction at
very small angles δ ≈ λXUV /λg , i.e. typically δ ∼ 1 mrad.
Due to these small diffraction angles and the short length of
gas jets (∼1 mm), the situation is always well described in

4.7. Selectively probing excited molecules
When an experiment aims at probing excited molecules to
be prepared by a preceding pump pulse, the excited state
is always populated with a certain probability only. The
question of how to separate the background signal due to
unexcited fraction of emitters from the signal due to the
excited fraction is, of course, a classic one for pump–probe
spectroscopy and methods for enhancing the detection contrast
or even completely suppressing the background do exist.
Two of these have already been mentioned in this tutorial
at other instances: transient grating spectroscopy [44, 45] (see
section 4.6.2), and polarization resolved detection [40] (see
section 4.4).

5. An example: experimental orbital reconstructions
As an illustration and application of many concepts introduced
in the preceding sections, let us review our study published
in [24] on orbital tomography with the N2 molecule. In
the experiments, HHG was driven with a linearly polarized
31

J. Phys. B: At. Mol. Opt. Phys. 44 (2011) 203001

PhD Tutorial

Ti:Sa-based laser, i.e. λ0 = 800 nm and typical electron
excursion durations ≈1.5 fs. Reference [129] assures us that
the movement of the nuclei in the N+2 ion (in its ground state)
upon ionization is negligible in this timespan: the nuclear
overlap integral (27) remains 0.95.
We treat the electronic structure of N2 in the Hartree–
Fock framework and use Koopmans’ approximation, thus
neglecting exchange contributions (cf section 2.2.2), which
is also supported by [100]. In this framework, multichannel contributions to HHG are described as multi-orbital
contributions: the channel-specific Dyson orbitals are simply
the ionized Hartree–Fock orbitals. The small energy difference
of ε ≈ 1.4 eV between the first excited and the ground
states of N+2 , i.e. between the HOMO and the HOMO-1, as
well as the fact that the HOMO-1 is much larger in the ydirection than the HOMO (see figure 11) make it likely that
both orbitals contribute to HHG in N2 [47]. For a symmetrical
molecule like N2 , all orbitals have a defined parity: the HOMO
is gerade and the HOMO-1 is ungerade. We thus can factorize
the complex XUV spectrum for each orbital without having to
limit recollision to one side of the molecule (cf section 3.3.1).
Since the laser is linearly polarized, ionization and recollision
angles are the same.
From (29), we know that the time-domain recombination
DME for multi-channel HHG can be written as a coherent
sum over the individual channel contributions. Its Fourier
transform and consequently the emitted complex XUV
spectrum, (ω), thus have the same form. In this study,
we disregard any coupling of the orbital contributions, i.e.
(de-)excitation of the N+2 ion during the electron excursion,
such that the channel weights b(j ) in (28) ff are timeindependent complex numbers set by the tunnel ionization
process, i.e. they depend on θ . We can thus use (36) for each
contributing channel with constant weight and sum to obtain
(using the length form)

variation of the first and the last: the slightly different EWP
spreading for the two contributions will only negligibly affect
the relative weight of both contributions; and the difference in
ionization DMEs for both contributions is neglected based on
the argument of the tunnel-ionization step acting as a strong
spatial filter (i.e. its k-dependence will be very similar for
both contributions; note, however, that their θ -dependence
is very different). For the remaining phase factor, we have
already found the variation with Ip in (44): due to the quasiclassical action along the trajectories being stationary, the
only significant phase variation comes from the difference
in phase acquired by the ions during the excursion duration.
Thus, αA (k)/αX (k) ≈ exp[−i ετ ]. Consequently, the
total recombination DME retrieved from our measurements
is described by
dexp (k, θ ) = bX (θ ) ψX |ˆr|k + bA (θ ) exp[−i ετ ] ψA |ˆr|k ,
= ψhole |ˆr|k ,
(53)
with
ψhole = bX ψX + bA exp[−i ετ ]ψA .
(54)
We have arrived at an expression describing a recombination
DME between a plane wave and a time-dependent hole–
wavefunction, given by the superposition of the two channelspecific Dyson orbitals beating with relative phase according
to their energy-difference. This is the same result as in (30),
and we can of course rephrase what we just did in the terms
employed to derive (30): we have approximated the continuum
EWP for both orbital contributions by the same packet of plane
waves with complex spectral amplitude, αX (k). The attentive
reader will have noticed that in (54), we have dropped the θ dependence of the channel weights. This is a simplification we
are forced to make if we want to define a hole-wavefunction
for our experiment. Actually, the created hole is different for
each θ and the bX/A in the expression for ψhole are thus to be
understood as channel weights averaged over all angles.
Before starting with the tomographic reconstruction, we
have to take a close look at what exactly has been measured.
The experiments, described in [24], collected data by a series of
RABBIT measurements of the HHG emission from N2 aligned
at angles θ = 0◦ , 10◦ , 20◦ , . . . 90◦ between the molecular
axis and the linear polarization direction of the driving laser
(the angular distribution of the molecules is simulated in
figure 17). These were normalized to the results of a RABBIT
measurement of the HHG emission from argon under the
same experimental conditions. Two reflections off gold-coated
mirrors made us preferentially detect the XUV polarization
component parallel to the driving laser polarization, i.e.
parallel to k. A perpendicular component is neglected—as
simulated in section 3.4.3.
The experiment measured the spectral intensities and
the group delay ∂ϕ/∂ω (cf section 4.6.1) for the harmonic
orders 17 to 31 and for each angle θ . In order to obtain
the spectral phase as a function of both ω and θ , we had to
add the assumption that ∂ϕ/∂θ = 0 for the lowest detected
harmonic order (supported by HHG 2-source interferometry
measurements done in Ottawa). The angular variation of
the ionization probabilities, [ηmol (θ )]2 , are not corrected for,
because (i) we had no means of reliably calculating them and
(ii) because we actually included them in our definition of the

(ω, θ ) = bX (θ )αX (k) ψX |ˆr|k + bA (θ )αA (k) ψA |ˆr|k ,
(52)
where the subscripts X and A denote the HOMO and HOMO-1
contributions, as in section 2.3.2.
√ This corresponds to equation
(1) in [24]. We use k = 2ω(cos θ, sin θ ), i.e.the XUV
frequency is associated with the same electron wavenumber
for both channels. Although one may want to include a
shift corresponding to ε, the uncertainty in the correct link
between XUV frequency and electron wavevector is much
larger than this issue anyhow. Note that the channel weights
bX/A (θ ) in (52) correspond to the ionization-angle-dependent
scaling of the EWP amplitudes, expressed by ηmol in (40)—the
relative ionization amplitudes fix the relative weights for the
contributing channels.
From the experimental data, we will retrieve the total
recombination DME as described in section 3.3.2. The
reference atom is argon since it has nearly the same ionization
potential as the N2 HOMO contribution (IpAr = 15.76 eV ≈
IpN2 = 15.58 eV). This calibrates for αX (k), but αA (k) is
somewhat different due to the corresponding Ip being larger
by ε. Of the three terms in (35), we can neglect the

hole wavefunction (54). Note, however, that we include the
sign changes of ηmol (θ ), as explained in the following.
The x- and y-components of the total DME, dexp (k, θ ),
have been determined from measured data for angles θ =
0◦ . . . 90◦ , i.e. points in the first quadrant of the Fourierspace representation of the objects xψhole and yψhole . Due
to the ‘phase memory’ of the EWP, we could not simply
continue the measurements for the remaining quadrants (see
section 3.3.2.2), and instead have to complete dexp (k, θ )
according to the symmetry of the contributing orbitals, i.e.
we have to include the sign changes of ηmol (θ ). But how
could we do so if two contributions with different symmetries
interfere?
As mentioned in section 3.3.1, the recombination DME
for the gerade HOMO is purely imaginary-valued and that for
the ungerade HOMO-1 is purely real-valued. This means that,
if the excursion durations, τ , for the used harmonic orders are
close to a multiple of the half-period of the beating between
both contributions, i.e. if ε ≈ nπ, n ∈ Z, then the two
orbital contributions to the total recombination DME (53)
are in quadrature. For a finite spectral range, this situation
can of course only be approximated, and as we show in
[24], for our experimental conditions, 0.75π
ετ
1.2π , so that HOMO and HOMO-1 contributions are indeed
approximately separated in the imaginary and real parts of the
total recombination DME (53), respectively. Note that since
dexp is determined up to a global phase only, we can of course
arbitrarily rotate it in the complex plane and this separation
into imaginary and real parts is only found at one particular
complex rotation. We found the most consistent tomographic
reconstructions, if the arbitrary global phase was set to zero.
The so-separated contributions to dexp (k, θ ) can now be
completed according to the symmetry of the orbitals, i.e. such
that, for Im[dexp (k, θ )], the x-component is even in kx and
odd in ky , and the y-component is odd in kx and even in ky ;
while for Re[dexp (k, θ )], the x-component is odd in both kx
and ky , and the y-component is even both in kx and ky . This
probably sounds confusing, but the reader will find that it is
straightforward to derive from the symmetry properties of the
Fourier transform that these are the symmetries of the DME
components that immediately follow from those of the orbitals.
Now, we are ready to use dexp (k, θ ) as input to the
tomography scheme described in section 3.4, using (48) and
(47). As we show in [24], when plugging in only the imaginary
part of dexp (k, θ ), we indeed reconstruct an experimental
image of the N2 HOMO (see figure 23(a)) with distortions
very similar to those obtained in the simulations (figure 15(c)).
When transforming only the real part, i.e. the HOMO-1
contribution, we preferred using the velocity form expression
(50) in order to avoid division by x/y in real space, which leads
to numerical problems with orbital node at y = 0. The result
is shown in figure 23(b).
While the reconstruction of the HOMO contains a clear
spatial structure that is not simply imposed by the symmetry
of the DME, this is not the case for the reconstruction of the
HOMO-1. It is essentially a result of the considered spectral
range and the imposed symmetry: when setting the DME
amplitudes to unity and the phases to zero for all angles and

dots mark the positions of the nuclei.

frequencies, the obtained image is almost the same as that
extracted from the experiment. Although this is expected for
the HOMO-1, the DME of which does not have any particular
structure in the considered spectral range, the absence of
structure in both simulation and experimental result does not
allow to claim a reconstruction of the HOMO-1. It is rather an
indication of the consistency of our experimental observations
and their interpretation.
While the limited spectral range (harmonics 17 to 31,
also used for the simulations shown in figures 13(b) and
15(c)) is certainly the most important limitation for a precise
reconstruction in real space, there are a few others. The
separation of both contributions into real and imaginary parts
of the DME is not perfect and there is an approximately
linear variation of their relative phase over the spectral range.
Furthermore, the relative weight of both contributions is not
constant but varies both with frequency and angle, which
introduces an additional filter-function in Fourier space and
thus distortions in real space.
Finally, we can of course use the full complex-valued
DME dexp (k, θ ) for a tomographic reconstruction to obtain
ψhole . The same result is obtained when simply summing the
two purely real-valued reconstructions obtained from real and
imaginary parts of the DME. The square of this sum is shown
in figure 23(c), in order to emphasize the asymmetry. This
2
, in the
reconstruction corresponds to the hole density, ψhole
+
N2 ion at after the ‘self-probing delay’, which is given by the
mean excursion duration of the harmonics orders considered.
This delay is τ = 1.5 fs, and the ‘exposure time’, i.e. the range
of excursion durations covered by the considered harmonic
range, is τ = 0.6 fs.
To conclude this example, we can ask how this result
could be improved and whether it could have been obtained
without separating the orbital contributions and imposing the
symmetries. Yes, we could achieve an improved result without
knowing in advance what we expect to reconstruct: if we
limit recollision to one side of the molecule and control the
EWP trajectories such that θi remains approximately constant
while measuring ∂ϕ/∂θ , we could in principle measure the
correct symmetries by beating the ‘phase memory’ issue.
Extending significantly the spectral range is possible via
shaped waveforms [126] and/or by using longer wavelengths
for the driving laser. Of course, a broader spectrum will in

retrieval methods. Enabling new techniques will in the future
complement this tool box; for instance laser-waveform shaping
will provide ever finer control over the probe EWP. For
experiments with non-symmetric molecules, progress in the
orientation of molecules in sufficiently dense gas samples will
be crucial.
The example of experimental orbital tomography has
shown that one has to take care in realizing which information
is actually measured in an experiment, and appreciate the
amount of pre-knowledge that has to be added in order to
extract information. On the other hand, it seems unnecessarily
ambitious to aim at imaging methods that do not require any
pre-knowledge about the system under study. For example,
the static structure of molecules before dynamics are launched
is almost always known with good precision. In any case,
orbital tomography is by no means a necessary goal for every
useful self-probing experiment. It is simply one possible
way of analysing the fundamental quantity which encodes
information about the molecule: the complex molecular
dipole. More accurate models may not allow a similar direct
information retrieval scheme, but there will always be ways to
disentangle valuable information.
The most important merit of self-probing is clearly that it
combines atomic scale spatial resolution with femtosecond or
even attosecond temporal resolution. While images retrieved
from experiments on static systems will probably never be
precise enough to be a benchmark for advanced quantumchemistry calculations, the attainable spatial resolution is
sufficient to be able to follow intra-molecular dynamics. While
self-probing cannot be taken as a scheme to ‘directly film’
electrons in molecules—every frame is retrieved from data
based on a model and has to be analysed carefully—we are
confident that ‘molecular movies’ will come to a (lecture)
theater near you soon.

general also cover a longer range of excursion durations—the
trade-off between spatial and temporal resolution inherent to
ultrafast imaging with chirp-encoded recollision is pointed out
in the comment by Smirnova and Ivanov on [24]. However,
conrol over the continuum electron trajectories will be able to
handle this issue as well.
As a second example, let us briefly consider the CO2
HOMO. Our data shown in figure 3 of [36], measured in the
exact same way as just described for N2 , can be used to perform
a tomographic reconstruction as well. Supposing that the Xchannel (i.e. the HOMO) dominates HHG, we can impose
the corresponding symmetry on the retrieved recombination
DME (the x-component is even in kx and odd in ky , and
vice versa for the y-component), and finally obtain the result
shown in figure 24(b). While it does not look very different
from the reconstruction assuming only the symmetry, shown in
figure 24(c), one can notice that instead of the diamond shape
of the latter, the core of the orbital presents an oval shape, closer
to the simulation presented in figure 24(a). Nonetheless, this
is certainly an example for an inconclusive case due to a too
narrow spectral range and corresponding too low precision in
the real-space reconstruction.

6. General conclusions and outlook
We hope we could convince many newcomers that the selfprobing paradigm holds great potential for measurements
˚
combining Angstr¨
om and attosecond resolution. Numerous
works applying self-probing in numerical or real-world
experiments, cited throughout this tutorial, have already
accumulated overwhelming evidence that the molecular dipole
in HHG does encode information on the structure and
dynamics in the molecule at these scales.
Many of the models upon which information retrieval
is based are still under active development and continuous
improvement can be expected for years to come. As the most
important construction sites let us mention the description of
the continuum EWP as well as the inclusion of multi-electron
effects.
The experimental tool-box for self-probing already
contains a great many techniques to access the relevant
observables serving as input to model-based information
