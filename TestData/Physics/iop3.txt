Abstract
Entanglement is nowadays considered as a key quantity for the understanding of correlations,
transport properties and phase transitions in composite quantum systems, and thus receives
interest beyond the engineered applications in the focus of quantum information science. We
review recent experimental and theoretical progress in the study of quantum correlations under
that wider perspective, with an emphasis on rigorous definitions of the entanglement of
identical particles, and on entanglement studies in atoms and molecules.

photons. Stronger correlations than those permitted by local
realism were thus testified [7–11].
Possible technological applications have triggered
enormous interest in quantum correlations.
With the
discovery of Shor’s factoring algorithm [12], which relies
on entanglement, quantum correlations became a topic of
the information sciences, since they hold the potential
to very considerably speed up quantum computers with
respect to classical supercomputing facilities [13] and may
thus jeopardize classical data encryption.
Also other
quantum technologies such as quantum imaging [14], certain
key-distribution schemes in quantum cryptography [15] or
quantum teleportation [16] rely on entanglement. Extensive
research activity in these diverse areas by now led to
considerable progress in our understanding of quantum
correlations when associated with engineered systems with
well-defined substructures.
More recently, the theory of entanglement has penetrated
into other fields of physics to gain a fresh perspective
on naturally occurring, often rather complex systems, and
to understand the role of quantum correlations for their
spectral and dynamical properties, or for their functionality,
even in biological structures [17–21].
It was shown,
e.g., that entanglement yields a versatile characterization of

1. Introduction
While first considered as an indicator of the incompleteness
of quantum physics [1], entanglement [2] is today understood
as one of the quantum world’s most important and glaring
properties.
It contradicts the intuitive assumption that
any physical object has distinctive individual properties
that completely define it as an independent entity and that
the results of measurement outcomes on one system are
independent of any operations performed on another spacelike separate system, an attitude also known as local realism.
Thereby it poses important epistemological questions
[3]. Since an experimental test of the scenario suggested in
[1] to prove incompleteness was long considered unfeasible,
the interest in entanglement was long rather restricted to
the philosophical domain. Not less than 30 years after the
formulation of the Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen (EPR) paradox
[1, 4], a proposal for the direct, experimental violation of
local realism, paraphrased in terms of a simple inequality,
re-anchored the discussion on physical grounds. The Bell
inequality [5, 6], which sets strict thresholds on classical
correlations of measurement results, was then proven to be
violated in experiments which employed entangled states of

Topical Review

quantum phase transitions in many-body systems [22–26],
and that simple concepts like the area law are indicative of
efficient numerical treatment of certain types of many-particle
systems [27].
In atomic and molecular physics, experimental progress
nowadays permits the detailed analysis and control of
various coherent phenomena in few-body dynamics where
entanglement is once again a potentially very useful tool. For
example, it was recently proposed to solve the long-standing
problem of a core vacancy (de)localization during a molecular
ionization process by analysing the entanglement between the
photo- and Auger electrons born in such a process [28].
The physical objects encountered in these latter fields
are, however, much more difficult to control and to describe
than the designed and engineered systems familiar from
quantum information science. Atoms and molecules do not
naturally exhibit definite and clear entanglement properties,
nor well-separated entities such as photons in different
optical modes [29, 30] or strongly repelling ions in radio
frequency traps [31] do. The identification of subsystems
which can carry entanglement therefore becomes a non-trivial
question, possibly complicated by the indistinguishability
of particles, and typical Hilbert space dimensions tend
to be rather large. Additionally, the interaction between
system constituents is typically of the long-range type,
thus rendering entanglement a dynamical quantity, difficult
to grasp, and without any unambiguous straightforward
definition. Moreover, it remains to be clearly defined to what
extent phenomena like macroscopic quantum superpositions
imply the existence of entanglement [32, 33] and vice versa.
This defines a challenging task for conceptual research in
quantum information theory, which ought to respond to novel
experimental challenges.
The scope of this review is threefold. First, we will
present an overview of the different facets entanglement can
have, together with a conceptual framework which permits us
to compare the entanglement properties of distinct physical
systems. Second, we will illustrate these theoretical concepts
with specific examples from experiments. Finally, we will
discuss recent experimental and theoretical developments,
in areas where entanglement received attention only very
recently. In order to keep the presentation most intuitive, we
will focus on specific physical realizations of entanglement
rather than on abstract mathematical properties, thus always
stressing the physical impact of entanglement on measurement
results.
To avoid redundancy with earlier reviews, we will not
cover studies of entanglement in established fields, but refer
the interested reader to [34, 35], where the mathematical and
quantum-information aspects of entanglement are reviewed
extensively.
More specialized reviews focus on the
specific properties of multipartite entanglement [36], on the
entanglement in continuous-variable systems [37, 38] and on
the interconnection between entanglement and violations of
local realism [39, 40]. An introduction to the quantification
of entanglement, i.e. on entanglement measures, can be
found in [41], and an overview on approximations to such
measures of entanglement, especially on efficient lower

bounds, together with applications to general scenarios of open
system entanglement dynamics, is given in [42]. Applications
of entanglement to the simulation of many-body systems are
reviewed in [22, 43], and focus on area laws can be found in
[27]. The relevance of entanglement for decoherence theory is
touched upon in [44, 45], entanglement in trapped ion systems
is discussed in [46], and entanglement between electronic spins
in solid-state devices in [47].
The text is organized as follows. In section 2, we
introduce fundamental notions of entanglement and related
concepts, so as to define a common language for the
subsequent sections. In section 3, we discuss the different
possibilities of subdividing physical systems into subunits,
and the influence of the specific choice of the partition on
the resulting entanglement. Contact is made to state-of-theart quantum optics experiments for illustration. Finally, in
section 4, we move on to theoretical and experimental studies
of quantum correlations in atomic and molecular physics
which bear virtually all of the aforementioned complications.
We conclude with an outlook on possible future directions for
studies of atomic, molecular and biological systems from a
quantum-information perspective.

2. Subsystem structures and entanglement
quantifiers
Let us now briefly recollect the required basic notions of
entanglement. Since several reviews and introductory articles
are available [34, 41, 42], we introduce only those concepts
which are necessary for the understanding of the subsequent
sections, to make this review self-contained. In particular,
we define the different entanglement measures employed in
atomic and molecular physics. We also explicitly discuss the
requirements on the subsystem structure, which are usually
implicitly assumed. This is necessary to establish a general
formalism that will allow us to classify the many diverse
approaches to entanglement in different systems.
2.1. Quantum and classical correlations
The central property that attracts broad attention is the
‘nonclassical’ correlations of measurement results on different
subsystems of an entangled state [1]. The situation is easiest
illustrated by a two-body system with two spatially wellseparated subsystems. The Hilbert space H of the twobody system then naturally decomposes into a tensor product
H1 ⊗ H2 of the two Hilbert spaces H1 and H2 of the two
subsystems, which we assume to both be of dimension d.
Now, consider the following exemplary bipartite state:
|

|j ⊗ |j .

(1)

j =1

A projective measurement in the (orthonormal) basis
{|j }, performed on the first subsystem, has completely
unpredictable results: each of the possible outcomes will
occur with the same probability 1/d. The same is true for
the analogous measurement on the second subsystem. Yet
the measurement results on both subsystems are perfectly

correlated: once a measurement result—say j = j0 —is
obtained on one subsystem, the two-body state is projected
on the state |j0 ⊗ |j0 , so that a subsequent measurement on
the other subsystem will yield the result j 0 with certainty.
Such correlations of measurement results might seem
surprising. They could, however, be explained rather simply:
think, for example, of an experiment in which both subsystems
are always prepared in the same (random) state |j . In
subsequent runs of the experiment (which are required to
obtain reliable measurement statistics) the choice of j is
completely random. The experimentalist thus creates a mixed
state

2.2. Separable and entangled states
In order to assign quantum states the label ‘entanglement’ in
a systematic fashion, we first need to define this new quality
on a formal level to subsequently introduce measures for the
amount of entanglement that is carried by a quantum state.
2.2.1. Pure states. A bipartite quantum state

This mixed state gives rise to exactly the same correlations of
measurement results as found for our initial example (1). In
fact, one does not even need a quantum mechanical system
to observe such correlations— coloured socks [48] or marbles
will do.
The situation changes completely, however, if a
measurement in a second, distinct orthonormal basis set
{|αj } is performed: to be specific, let us assume that this
measurement is performed on the first subsystem. Given the
measurement outcome αp , the two-body state (1) is projected
on the state
αp |j |j = |αp ⊗ |α˜ p ,

such that the compound state can be written as a tensor product,
|
| = 1 ⊗ 2 . This is equivalent to the statement that the
first particle is prepared in |φ1 , while the second particle
is prepared in |φ2 , which corresponds to the assignment
of a physical reality, as will be discussed in more detail in
section 3.1.1.
A state that is not separable is called entangled. The
information carried by an entangled state | , which cannot
be written as a tensor product as in (7), is not completely
specified in terms of the states of the subsystems: for
2
the reduced density matrices, we have Tr 1/2
= 1, i.e.
the subsystems’ states are mixed. Furthermore, one finds
|
| = 1 ⊗ 2 , i.e. the two-particle state |
contains
more information on measurement outcomes than is contained
in the two single-particle states 1 and 2 together, in contrast
to the separable state (7). Moreover, distinct entangled states
can give rise to the same√
reduced density matrices: the states
√
| + = (|1, 1 + |0, 0 ) / 2 and | + = (|0, 1 + |1, 0 ) / 2
lead to the same, maximally mixed, reduced density matrices,
1 = 2 = 112 /2, where 11l denotes the identity in l dimensions.
The state | + , however, describes a correlated pair, whereas
| + is anti-correlated.
Formally, the attribute of separability (and, correspondingly, entanglement) boils down to the question whether the
coefficient matrix cj,k in the state representation

(4)

The outcomes of a subsequent measurement on the second
subsystem in the basis |α˜ p can therefore be predicted with
certainty, although they were completely undetermined before
the prior measurement on the first subsystem. If the same is
attempted with the state (2), the first measurement projects the
state on

Separable states are completely determined by the singleparticle states |φ1 and |φ2 , which contain all information
on possible measurement outcomes. Unlike the situation
described by (1), a measurement performed on one subsystem
has no effect on the other subsystem, i.e. the subsystems are
uncorrelated. Consequently, the reduced density matrices

can find single-particle states |φi ∈ Hi such that

In other words, the second subsystem is left in a mixed
state, with incoherently added components |j j |. Unless
the basis {|αp } coincides with the basis {|j }, results of a
projective measurement on this second system component
remain uncertain.
In conclusion, a mixed state such as (2) can only explain
correlations that are observed in one specific single-particle
basis, whereas the entangled state (1) exhibits correlations for
all possible choices of orthogonal local basis settings. We
therefore see that quantum physics hosts a type of correlations
which cannot be classically described. These correlations are
often referred to as quantum correlations and understood as
the ultimate physical manifestation of ‘entanglement’.

separated. Theories that obey local realism can be described
by classical random variables.
A rigorous way to establish a correspondence between
‘non-classical’ correlations and entanglement is provided
by Bell inequalities [5]. These are defined in terms of
correlations between measurement results of different singleparticle observables, and they give threshold values for the
correlations to be describable in terms of classical probability
theory. An experimental violation, i.e. any excess beyond the
threshold value, indicates that the corresponding observables
cannot be described as classical random variables. The
community jargon also speaks of the unavailability of a ‘local
realistic description’. A widely used Bell inequality is the one
presented by Clauser, Horne, Shimony and Holt (CHSH) [6]. It
is formulated for dichotomic observables such as polarization,
i.e. observables which only take the values +1 and −1, and
reads

2.2.2. Mixed states. Separable and entangled states can also
be defined for mixed states of a bipartite quantum system,
which have to be described in terms of density matrices. In
this case, the mixedness of the reduced density matrices is not
equivalent to entanglement.
A state that can be expressed as a tensor product of singlebody density matrices,
ρp =

1

⊗

(12)

2,

bears no correlations between local measurement results at all,
and is called a product state.
Separable states are defined by sets of single-particle
states 1(i) and 2(i) of the first and second subsystem,
0,
respectively, and by associated probabilities pi (i.e. pi
and i pi = 1), such that [54]
ρs =

Such separable states imply correlations between measurement results on the different subsystems, but these correlations
can be explained in terms of the probabilities pi , and, therefore,
do not qualify as quantum correlations. The tag entanglement
is, thus, reserved for those states that cannot be described in
terms of product states of single-particle states and of classical
probabilities as in (13). They thus need to be described as

where Aj and Bk are different observables acting on the two
subsystems. This inequality is derived under the assumption of
local realism, which means that measurement outcomes at one
subsystem are independent of the measurements performed
on the other subsystem, provided both subunits are spatially
separated. In order to violate the inequality, the local
observables need to be non-commuting, [A1 , A2 ] = 0 =
[B1 , B2 ]. It is hence necessary to implement a rotation
of the measurement basis to assess such non-commuting
observables. This is also illustrated in the polarization rotation
effectuated on the photons in figure 1: in a polarizationentanglement experiment, it is not sufficient to measure the
correlations in a given basis, say the z-basis, but the orientation
of the quantization axis needs to be chosen locally. Similarly,
correlations in the position or in the momentum alone do
not rigorously prove that a two-particle state is entangled in
the external degrees of freedom (see also the discussion in
sections 4.2 and 4.6.2). The difficulty of the implementation
of mutually distinct measurement bases is an impediment
for the direct assessment of the entanglement properties of
many naturally occurring, multicomponent quantum systems
such as atoms [49, 50] or biological structures [51]. It is
then necessary—and still largely an open issue—to conceive
alternative indicators that distinguish entanglement from
classical correlations [52].
For a maximally entangled bipartite qubit (or Bell-) state
as defined in (19), (20), the expectation value
of the left√
hand side of (15) can reach values up to 2 2 ≈ 2.82 for a
suitable choice of the measurement settings Aj , Bk . When such
experimental conditions are met, the notion of non-locality as
defined by Bell inequalities is qualitatively in agreement with
the definition of separability and entanglement in section 2.2:
a violation of a Bell inequality proves that the state under
consideration is entangled. The reverse is, however, not true:
there are states which are entangled according to section 2.2,
but do not violate any Bell inequality [53], since a description
in terms of classical probabilities is available despite their nonseparability according to (14) [54]. An example is given by

2.3. Bell inequality violation and nonlocality
So far, we identified the difference between classical and
quantum correlations with the help of the exemplary states
given by equations (1) and (2), and we have given formal
definitions for entangled and separable states. On the other
hand, we still need to establish how to unambiguously identify
and quantify the exceptional, ‘non-classical’, correlations
inscribed in (1) in an experimental setting. This is required
to provide a connection to probability theory and to provide
a benchmark for the verification of entanglement in an
experiment.
For this purpose, we first need to specify what is
understood as ‘classical’ in our present context. We call a
theory ‘classical’ if it is local and realistic. The principle
of locality states that any object is influenced directly only
by its immediate surroundings, and that there can be no
signals between space-like separated events. Realism denotes
the assumption that any physical system possesses intrinsic
properties, i.e. an experimentalist who measures the value of
an observable merely reads off a predefined value [1] (as,
e.g., for the mixed state (2) that is created by a random,
however, realistic mechanism). That is to say, although one
may ignore the value of a certain observable, each observable
still possesses a definite value at any moment. In practice,
‘local realism’ implies that measurement outcomes at one
subsystem are independent of the measurements performed
on the other subsystem, provided both subunits are spatially

where p ∈ [0, 1], i.e. the state is a mixture of the maximally

and the maximally mixed, fully uncorrelated state 114 /4 =
112 /2 ⊗ 112 /2 (see (12)). The entanglement and the non-local
properties of the state depend on the parameter p: ρW (0) is
a pure, maximally entangled state, which also violates √
(15)
maximally. This√
violation persists for 0 < p < 1 − (1/ 2).
For p 1 − (1/ 2), a local realistic description is available,
but the state is still entangled
as long as p < 2/3. In
√
other words, for 1 − (1/ 2) < p < 2/3, the state is
entangled according to (14), but it does not violate local
realism. This enforced qualitative distinction between nonlocality and entanglement needs to be upheld for mixed states,
whereas for pure bipartite qubit states, any non-product state
violates a Bell inequality [55].
When we conclude from the violation of a Bell
inequality that no local realistic description of a given
experiment exists, we rely, among others, on the strong
assumptions that the measurements which are performed
on the subsystems are space-like separated [56], and that
possible detector inefficiencies are unbiased with respect to
the measurement outcomes [57, 58]. These requirements
represent serious challenges for experiments, such that tests
of Bell inequalities are often plagued by loopholes: the
failure to fulfil the aforementioned assumptions may allow a
description of the experiment outcomes by classical theories,
and additional experimental effort is required to ‘close the
loopholes’ [59–61].

and of the concept of entanglement witnesses. Pure states lie on the
surface of the convex set of density matrices; all states that are not

itself convex. The set of entangled states is shaded in grey, and not
convex. In this geometrical picture, an entanglement witness defines
a hyperplane (dotted line): states above that plane are detected to be
entangled, while states below that plane cannot be unambiguously
classified by this specific choice of witness/hyperplane. (Adapted

Consequently, any quantum state ρ for which Tr(ρ W
0, i.e. which yields a negative expectation value of the
witness in the experiment, is thereby verified to be entangled.
Witnesses are universal in the sense that one can find a suitable
witness for any entangled state. Bell inequalities can be seen
as a specific class of entanglement witnesses [66], which only
detect states that violate local realism. We summarize the
concept of separable and entangled, pure and mixed states in
figure 2.

2.4. Entanglement witnesses
Since the above discussion implies that non-locality is a
stronger criterion than entanglement, Bell inequalities are
not a universal means to experimentally detect quantum
correlations. A general method to verify entanglement is given
by entanglement witnesses [62, 63], i.e. operators which detect,

or ‘witness’, entanglement [64, 65]. A Hermitian operator W

2.5. Local operations and classical communication
The distinction between separable and entangled states
has attracted substantial interest from both theoretical
[62, 67–70] and experimental sides [71, 72] (see, e.g., [73] for a
5

J. Phys. B: At. Mol. Opt. Phys. 44 (2011) 192001

Topical Review

recent review), but this distinction alone is largely insufficient
to draw a complete picture of the physics of entanglement.
The next step towards a deeper understanding is the ability to
compare the entanglement content of different states. Given
the rather abstract nature of entanglement, it is, however, not
obvious how such a comparison should work. By now, some
consensus has been reached in the literature that the concept
of local operations and classical communication (LOCC)
provides an appropriate framework [89].
Local operations include all manipulations that are
allowed by the laws of quantum mechanics—including
measurements, coherent driving, interactions with auxiliary
degrees of freedom—under the condition that they are
restricted to either one of the individual subsystems.
Operations that require an interaction between the subsystems
do not fall into this class, and quantum correlations thus
cannot be generated by local operations. Only classical
communication is admissible here to create correlations:
the result of a measurement on one subsystem can be
communicated to a receiver which is ready to execute a
local operation on the other subsystem, and this subsequent
operation can be conditioned on the prior measurement result.
One can thereby indeed induce correlations: for example, the
exemplary state (2) could have been prepared by randomly
preparing one of the basis states |i of the first subsystem,
and subsequent communication of the choice of i to a receiver
which controls the second subsystem. If this person prepares
its subsystem in the same state, then many repetitions of this
procedure yield (2). It is, however, impossible to create an
entangled state through the application of LOCC, starting out
from an initially separable state. Therefore, it is justified to
consider a state ρ2 equally or less entangled than a state ρ1 , if
ρ2 can be obtained from ρ1 through the application of LOCC.

on the other.
Both states are strongly entangled and
are certainly candidates to qualify as maximally entangled.
However, a |W state can neither be obtained through the
application of LOCC on a |GHZ state, nor is the inverse
possible [76]. Consequently, since there is no state in a triqubit system from which all other states can be obtained, one
has to get acquainted with the idea that there is no unique
maximally entangled state in multi-partite systems, but that
there are inequivalent classes, or families, of entangled states.
The classification of these is subject to active research (see
[34] for an overview and [77–80] for recent results), and still
far from being accomplished.
2.6. Entanglement quantification
In order to define a measure of entanglement, we need to
specify under which conditions two quantum states can be
regarded as equivalent, i.e. when they carry the same amount
of entanglement. This can be certified if the states are related
to each other via invertible LOCC, i.e. via unitary operations
that are applied locally and independently on the subsystems:

communication or other infrastructure. Any entanglement
quantifier, therefore, ought to be independent of such local
unitaries.

[74, 75]. Also on higher-dimensional subsystems, such states

The application of suitable LOCC allows us to convert (1) into

The λj fully determine the entanglement of | ,
and functions M(| ) of the λj that are non-increasing
under LOCC are called entanglement monotones [81],
which quantify the state’s entanglement.
Under some
additional requirements [41, 82] beyond the scope of
our present discussion, entanglement monotones are also
called entanglement measures. The following entanglement
monotones for bipartite systems will appear in the course of

Since this decomposition is not unique [90], a simple average

in particular that M(ρ) vanishes on the separable states.

in decreasing order. In practice, the optimization problem
implicit in (33) renders its quantitative evaluation a challenging
task for larger systems, beyond two qubits, and there is only
limited insight and literature on approximations and rigorous
bounds [42, 73, 96–100].
For systems with more than two subunits, no
straightforward generalization of the Schmidt decomposition
is available. Other concepts of entanglement measures
have thus been designed, which can be generalized to such
multipartite states, i.e. states with more than two subsystems.
One example is the distance to the set of separable states [35],
(36)
ED (ρ) = minσ ∈S D(ρ, σ ),
where D(ρ, σ ) is a distance measure between two states [101]
and the minimum is taken over all states σ within
DTr (ρ, ω) = Tr(ρ − ω),
(37)
and the minimum is taken over all states σ within the set of
separable states S. This quantity possesses a straightforward
geometrical interpretation, illustrated in figure 3.
The
evaluation of this and any other multipartite measure for mixed,
multipartite states is, in general, computationally demanding,
for the reasons described above.

Since all these quantities are given in terms of the Schmidt
coefficients λj , they are readily evaluated for arbitrary bipartite
pure states.
In addition, the Schmidt coefficients allow us to decide
whether a state | can be prepared deterministically from an
initially given state | via LOCC. This is possible if and only
if the Schmidt coefficients of | are majorized by the Schmidt
coefficients of | [89]. Majorization is defined by

restrict the verifiable or exploitable entanglement. The
impossibility of measuring coherent superpositions of
eigenstates of certain operators, either due to fundamental
reasons like, e.g., charge conservation or as a consequence
of the lack of a shared reference frame that prevents
experimentalists from gauging their measurement instruments,
is described by the formulation of superselection rules (SSRs)
[107–109]. Such rules strongly restrict the nature and outcome
of possible measurements. In contrast to selection rules
which give statements on the system evolution generated by
some Hamilton with certain symmetries, SSRs postulate much
stricter behaviour. Two states | 1 and | 2 are said to be
separated by a SSR if for any physically realizable observable

2.7. Modelling physical systems
2.7.1.
Subsystem structures.
In the modelling of
entanglement inscribed into real physical systems, it is natural
to ask how to partition the Hilbert space, i.e. how to choose
the subsystem structure on which entanglement is defined.
This choice can be largely variable [102]: consider, e.g., a
16-dimensional space, H = C16 . This can be seen as the
tensor product of four Hilbert spaces that represent a twolevel system each (16 = 24 , C16 = C2 ⊗ C2 ⊗ C2 ⊗ C2 ,
figure 4(a)), or as the tensor product of two Hilbert spaces
that each represent a particle with four discrete eigenstates
(16 = 42 , C16 = C4 ⊗ C4 , see figure 4(b)), or as one,
indivisible, Hilbert space of dimension 16 (figure 4(c)). The
specific physical situation is then clearly distinct, as evident
from the illustrations. In general, a natural partition is
induced by the definition of the system degrees of freedom:
a 16-dimensional Hilbert space is spanned by two four-level
atoms, a four-ion quantum register where each ion bears two
computational levels, or, e.g., by a quantized single-mode
resonator field populated by maximally 15 photons.
The very definition of the system degrees of freedom
thus also affects the expected entanglement between them.
Consider, e.g., the hydrogen atom, as an example for
a continuous variable system with infinite-dimensional
subsystem dimension: when partitioned into centre-of-mass
degree of freedom and relative coordinates, both degrees
of freedom separate completely, and no entanglement is
exhibited. In contrast, if we choose the partition into electronand proton-coordinates, the subunits remain coupled, and
exhibit non-vanishing entanglement [103]. Very distinct
entanglement properties can thus be ascribed to the same
physical system [102, 104–106]—according to the choice of
the system partition. As long as the partition is itself invariant
under the system dynamics, it can be defined a priori once and
forever, while the situation may turn more complicated if this
condition is not fulfilled—e.g. for identical particles that are
scattered by a beam splitter (see section 3.4.1), or in electrons
bound by atoms (see section 4.5)).

It is important to note that SSR are not equivalent to
conservation laws and also do not restrict the accessible states
of a system. Instead, a SSR is a postulated statement on
the physical realizability of operators [110]. For example,
the direct implementation of an operator which projects on
a coherent superposition of an electron and a proton is
impossible.
When a SSR applies, the executable operations and
measurements are restricted, and the entanglement of a system
possibly cannot be fully accessed. Entanglement constrained
by SSR is indeed bounded from above by the entanglement
evaluated according to the rules of the above sections
[110–112]. A SSR that prevents a local basis rotation, e.g.,
may enforce that the entanglement which is formally present in
a state effectively reduces to a classical correlation.
Suppose
√
two parties share the state (|e, p + |p, e ) / 2 where |e and
|p indicate the wavefunction of an electron and a proton,
respectively. While this state is formally entangled, it is
effectively impossible to measure a coherent superposition
of an electron and a proton. Hence,
√ measurements in other
bases, e.g. in the basis (|e ± |p ) / 2, are unfeasible, and no
quantum correlations can be verified. Consequently, the very
classification of pure entangled states becomes more complex
due to the impossibility of performing certain measurements
[113].

charge conservation [115], the possibility of accessing a
shared reference frame in which the underlying symmetry is
broken can actually enable the preparation and measurement
of superposition states [109], and thereby circumvent the SSR.
The indirect observation of such coherences may be possible
with the help of ancilla5 particles which interact with the
system and thereby provide such symmetry breaking [116].
The problem of entanglement constrained by SSR will
turn salient in section 3.5, where we will discuss in more detail
the problem of assigning entanglement to mode-entangled
states, i.e. states in which the local particle number is not
fixed.

3. Subunits and degrees of freedom
In the previous section, we discussed entanglement as a
property of a compound system that characterizes correlations
between the system’s subunits, which, from now on, will also
be called entities. In general, certain degrees of freedom of
these subunits can be quantum-mechanically correlated, i.e.
entangled, with those of other entities, and the tensorial Hilbert
space structure directly reflects this, possibly hierarchical,
subsystem structure.
For identical particles, however, the invariance of all
physical observables with respect to the exchange of any two
particles and the (anti)symmetry of the (fermionic) bosonic
multiparticle wavefunction lead to a new conceptual challenge,
and to the failure of the above strategy. The strong constraints
on allowed states and on possible measurements imply that
direct access to the ‘first’ or ‘second’ particle is not possible
when dealing with identical particles, since particle labels are
no physical degrees of freedom. Therefore, the identification
of Hilbert spaces with subsystems, which we explicitly
assumed in section 2.2, fails when dealing with identical
particles, and a different formalism is required to characterize
the subunits between which entanglement is considered. As
we will see below, upon closer inspection of several, partially
irreconcilable entanglement concepts [117–121], the debate
on what is the proper formalism is still not completely settled
in the literature.
In order to find a suitable concept for the entanglement of
identical particles, we start with the conceptually simpler case
of non-identical or effectively non-identical particles. Once
we have established the physical ingredients of entanglement,
and after relating these to the formal definitions introduced in
section 2, we will proceed towards more elaborate subsystem
structures with identical particles involved. Finally, we give
an overview of the diverse degrees of freedom that can exhibit
entanglement in a real experimental setting.

Effective SSRs do not only appear due to fundamental
conservation rules, but also when two parties in possession of
a compound quantum state do not share a perfect reference
frame [109, 114], i.e. a convention on time, phase and spatial
directions. This connection between SSRs and reference
frames can be seen in the following example. Suppose one
party, A, prepares a quantum state ρ and sends it to another
party B. The reference frames of A and B are related to each
other by a transformation T (g), where g is an element of
the transformation group, and T (g) is its unitary realization.
If, however, B does not know the relative orientation of the
individual reference frames, the state B will effectively have
access to is the one sent by A, but averaged over all possible
transformations. Such an effectively accessible quantum state
for B reads
ρ¯ =

dgT (g)ρT −1 (g) ≡ G[ρ],

(39)

where the integral is taken over all elements of the group,
and G is baptized the twirling operation [109]. In general,
G is not injective3 ; hence, the accessible space becomes
smaller under the twirling operation. Only quantum states
that are fully invariant under arbitrary transformations, i.e.
states ρ with [ρ, T (g)] = 0 for any g, can be distinguishable
building blocks, and only operations that commute with all
transformations g can be reliably performed on the subsystems
[110]. The transformation group can, e.g., represent spatial
rotations and generate invariance under O(3), as illustrated in
figure 5. If party A sends a particle in the spin-up state, |↑ ,
to party B, the latter has access to this pure state only when
A and B share a convention regarding the spatial quantization
axis, i.e. the axis in space with respect to which the state has
been prepared. Without such a convention, B will observe a
fully mixed state and cannot extract any information. In this
case, B cannot distinguish any single-particle state by its spin,
because all are equivalent to the completely unbiased mixture
G[|↑ ] = 112 /2.
On the other hand, given a fundamental SSR generated by
a compact group4 , like the very U (1) group which describes

particles in order to establish the physical meaning of
entanglement and of separability in the spirit of the original

In other words, G does not preserve distinctness: there can be two distinct
states ρ1 = ρ2 for which G[ρ1 ] = G[ρ2 ].

contrast to, e. g., the Lorentz or the Poincar´e group.

operations, inspired by the Latin translation of ‘maiden’. Often, they fall

EPR approach [1]. We will thus establish the terminology
which we also need for a rigorous definition of the
entanglement of identical particles. We aim at an approach
which allows for a continuous transition from the entanglement
properties of indistinguishable to those of distinguishable
particles (as quantified in section 2.5), e.g. under a dynamical
evolution which transforms the system constituents from
an initially indistinguishable to a finally distinguishable
state (as possibly induced, e.g., by an atomic or molecular
fragmentation process).
In the case of non-identical particles, the entities that
carry entanglement are well defined: they correspond to the
very particles, which exhibit some properties such as rest
mass or charge, which allows us to distinguish them without
ambiguity. Other degrees of freedom of these particles that
can be coherently superposed then eventually give rise to the
particles’ entanglement. In this situation, we can directly
associate Hilbert space H1 with the Hilbert space of the
first particle, and Hilbert space H2 with that of the second.
Vectors in these Hilbert spaces directly describe the state of
the dynamical degree of freedom, such as spin or momentum,
for the respective particle.

where |↑ , |↓ denote internal degrees of freedom, while |L
and |R denote orthogonal spatial wavefunctions, is partially
entangled: whereas system 1 possesses properties associated
with it being prepared in the |L state, we cannot specify
all of its properties, since the particles’ internal degrees of
freedom remain fully correlated and locally unknown. This
corresponds to the situation in most experiments: particles
do possess properties by which they can be distinguished—
e.g. their position—while their entanglement manifests in
some other degree of freedom. In such a situation, the
‘labelling’ degree of freedom (position |L or |R in (41))
can be simply dropped, and the entangled states, e.g., of a
photon’s polarization and of the electronic degree of freedom
of an atom, live in the two-particle Hilbert space

3.1.1. Entanglement and subsystem properties according
to the EPR approach. A quantum state is not entangled
[1] if we can assign a complete set of properties to each
individual subsystem [122], i.e. if we can design a projective
measurement on each subsystem with an outcome that can
be predicted with certainty. In other words, there exists
an observable such that its measurement on the given nonentangled state reveals the ‘pre-existing’ system values, which
we intuitively ascribe to it, as in classical mechanics. In the
jargon, this is equivalent to finding a realistic description of
the system’s constituents [1].
Specifically, for a pure state |
which describes a
composite two-particle system, the subsystem S1 is nonentangled with the subsystem S2 if there exists a onedimensional projection operator P (with eigenvalue 1, by
definition) such that

particles, the strict rule that

For distinguishable

• Only interaction between particles6 can lead to an
entangled state
can be formulated, in contrast to indistinguishable particles,
as we will see in section 3.4. Distinguishable particles, even if
prepared in a pure separable state, will be entangled for almost
all times [123], if the unitary evolution which describes their
common evolution contains parts which do not factorize as
in (24), i.e. if the Hamiltonian contains an interaction part.
Given a many-particle Hamiltonian, one can deduce from its
interaction part which degrees of freedom will be entangled. A
Hamiltonian which only couples external degrees of freedom
will, e.g., not induce any entanglement in the particles’ spin.
In every many-particle bound state such as that of
a simple hydrogen atom, the constituents are necessarily
entangled in their external degrees of freedom [103]: the
binding potential contains the operator r1 − r2 , i.e. it
couples the position operators of the constituents (proton and
electron for the hydrogen atom). Inclusion of the spin–orbit
interaction additionally induces entanglement between the
external degrees of freedom and the spin, as we will discuss
in more detail in section 4.5.5. The analogous reasoning
applies for unbound systems: in the course of a scattering
process, particles naturally entangle under the specified
interaction [124].
We retain the intuitive picture that for distinguishable
particles, entanglement is a direct consequence of interaction.

(40)

where P acts on the Hilbert space of the first particle, and the
identity 11 on the second particle [122]. In this case, we can
assert that the first subsystem possesses the physical properties
defined by the operator P. The outcome of the measurement
of P is not subject to any uncertainty; the first subsystem was
necessarily prepared in the unique eigenstate of P.
This notion of ‘possession of a complete set of properties’
is fully equivalent to the notion of separability that we fixed in
(7): the properties of any separable state are naturally given by
projections on the quantum states of its constituent particles;
as soon as a state requires more than one product state for
its representation (and thus is an entangled state), such welldefined constituent properties can no longer be identified.
Besides separability, we can also define partial and total
entanglement in the above framework [122]. For example, the
state

freedom (see footnote 5 on p 9).

Schmidt rank (see section 2.6) of the evolved state drops below
d, Gd drops to 0, while lower-ranked entanglement may still
be present in the system. For k < d, upper bounds for Gk and
thereby clear disentanglement criteria can be derived within
the same formalism. Since the evolution of the quantum state
is continuous, it is, however, guaranteed that any state with
initially non-vanishing Gd will remain Gd -entangled at least
for short times.

3.2.2. Open system entanglement. If a quantum system is
closed, i.e. if it is decoupled from uncontrolled degrees of
freedom lumped together under the term ‘environment’, all
entanglement properties are encoded in the Hamiltonian and
in its eigenstates, or in the dynamical evolution it generates.
The time evolution of entanglement under such strictly
Hamiltonian dynamics can then be evaluated by application
of pure state entanglement measures on the time-dependent
state vector | (t) . Purely Hamiltonian evolution is, however,
untypical for experiments, where the environment cannot be
screened away completely. Therefore, decoherence, i.e. the
gradual loss of the off-diagonal entries of the density matrix
[125], makes entanglement fade away and limits its possible
harvesting.
To account for such—detrimental—environmental
influence, one can evaluate mixed state entanglement
measures as defined in (33) on the system density matrix
ρ(t) for all t. However, this quickly turns into a tedious, if
not unfeasible, task with increasing system size, due to the
optimization problem implied by (33). Efficiently evaluable
lower bounds of entanglement alleviate the computational
challenge [42, 78, 96, 97] though cannot fully compensate the
unfavourable scaling of optimization space with the system
size.
Alternative approaches try to circumvent this problem
by incorporating the specific type of environment coupling
into the analysis, to extract the entanglement evolution of
representative ‘benchmark’ states [126–131]. The very
knowledge of the source of decoherence effectively reduces
the complexity of the problem (however, it remains to be
quantified to what extent). For the simplest scenario of open
system entanglement evolution, a qubit pair with only one
qubit coupled to the environment, even an exact entanglement
evolution equation is available: given the pure two-qubit’s
initial state |χ , and the completely positive map7 $ [125] that
one qubit is exposed to, the system’s final state reads
ρ = (11 ⊗ $) |χ

χ| .

3.2.3. Entanglement statistics. Given the difficulty to
characterize the open system entanglement evolution for
individual initial states, because of the exponential scaling
of state space with system size, it is suggestive to employ
statistical tools. It can then be shown, under rather general
assumptions on the open system dynamics described by some
time-dependent map t and on the employed entanglement
measure E,8 that deviations of the final entanglement of an
arbitrary pure initial state | under the action of t from the
mean entanglement E (t) of all pure states acted upon by t
are exponentially suppressed in and in the system dimension

where P quantifies the probability of the event being specified

characterize E and t , with η t < 1.
Whereas the efficient evaluation of the entanglement
evolution of individual initial states of large composite systems
will at some point turn prohibitive, (45) provides a statistical
estimate which becomes ever tighter with increasing system
size. In other words, the vast majority of initially pure
multipartite states in a high-dimensional Hilbert space share
the same entanglement properties [134]. Consequently, the
entanglement evolution is similar for almost all initial states,
and asymptotic behaviour emerges with typical traits that
are independent of the exact quantum state, reminiscent of
thermodynamic quantities.

3.3. Identical particles

(44)

As anticipated above, a consistent treatment of the
entanglement of identical particles is much more subtle
than for distinguishable particles.
The Hilbert-space
structure of two or more identical particles no longer
reflects a physical partition into subsystems, due to the
(anti)symmetrization of the many-particle wavefunction, as a
result of the symmetrization postulate [135]. The principle of
indistinguishability [136] that applies to all physical operators
leads to an uncircumventable super-selection rule (see
section 2.7.2). This problem has been at the origin of a
long debate [117, 119, 122, 137–144] on how to define a
useful measure for a given state of identical particles. In the
following, we describe the current state of affairs and elaborate

where |
is the (maximally entangled, see (19), (20))
benchmark state, and |χ an arbitrary initial state. The
entanglement evolution of |χ thus factorizes into a
contribution given by the benchmark state’s entanglement
upon the action of the map $, and a second term given
by the initial state’s concurrence C(|χ ). This result can
be generalized for bipartite systems with d-dimensional
subspaces [127], with C in (44) replaced by G-concurrence
Gd (ρ) [132]. The measure Gd (ρ) quantifies entanglement
of rank d states, i.e. of states that are obtained as a coherent
superposition that exhausts all basis states. Whenever the

need to be positive.

with antisymmetric coefficients wa,b = −wb,a , and fermionic
creation operators fa† fb† , which act on the vacuum state |0
and create a particle in the single-particle state |a (|b ). In
analogy to any bipartite state of distinguishable particles that
can be written in the Schmidt decomposition (25), the above
state can be represented in the Slater decomposition [120]

on how to refine the above criterion of a complete set of
properties (section 3.1.1) for the case of identical particles
[122].
3.3.1. Entanglement of particles. In many cases, when
two identical particles are well separated—as in typical
experiments with photons in different optical modes, or with
strongly repelling trapped ions—no ambiguity is possible,
and the physical subsystem-structure is apparent from the
preparation of the state and the accessible observables [145].
This is already realized in quantum mechanics textbooks, e.g.
[146] states that

|

where |A and |B describe orthogonal wavefunctions. On
a first glance, the wavefunction appears to be entangled,
since it cannot be written as the product state, and it has
Schmidt rank 2 (see (25)). However, a more careful analysis
of the situation shows that neither particle in the system
is affected by any physical uncertainty: the wavefunction
| AB describes two particles, with their positions in space
described by |A and |B , which are prepared in the internal
states |1 and |0 , respectively. Physically speaking, we can
easily assign a physical reality and thereby properties (in the
sense of section 3.1.1) to the particles: a measurement of
the particle located at |A (|B ) will always yield the internal
state |1 (|0 ). On the other hand, no physical operator can
be conceived which refers unambiguously to the ‘first’ or the
‘second’ particle, since the particles are—by assumption—
indistinguishable, which implies the permutation symmetry of
all operators. In other words, the merely formal entanglement
in the unphysical particle labels cannot be exploited directly
and does not correspond to a lack of information about the
physical preparation of the system’s constituents—indeed we
have just established that there are two particles in the system
which both possess a physical reality [117]. Hence, instead
of the Hilbert spaces of the particles which no longer allow
to address the particles individually, some other, physical,
degrees of freedom need to be identified with the distinctive
properties of the entities that carry entanglement.

where rj is the Slater rank of the respective pure state j j ,
the Slater rank of ρ is defined as k = min(rmax ), where rmax
is the maximal Slater rank within one decomposition, and the
minimum is taken over all decompositions, in strict analogy
to the case of distinguishable particles [83]. Witnesses (see
section 2.4) for the minimal number of Schmidt coefficients
[148] for distinguishable particles can be imported to Slater
witnesses [120], which witness states require a certain minimal
Slater rank.
While the analogies between Slater rank and Schmidt
rank, worked out in [120], also suggest similarities for the
properties and the interpretation of the reduced density matrix
of one particle (see section 2.6), it is important to note that the
reduced density matrix of one particle, 1 , still exhibits some
intrinsic uncertainty due to the formal entanglement in the
particle label. The relationship between Schmidt coefficients
and the eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix (see (25),
(26) in section 2.6) therefore breaks down in the case of
identical particles. The Slater coefficients are not directly
related to the eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix.
Entanglement measures based on the reduced density matrix
therefore need to be interpreted carefully here, since they do
not yield a result in full analogy to the case of distinguishable
particles. Such interpretation follows in section 3.3.4.

3.3.2.
Slater decomposition and rank.
In order
to differentiate between physical correlations and mere
correlations in the particle labels, we use the Slater
decomposition instead of the Schmidt decomposition (25):
two fermions which occupy an n-dimensional Hilbert
space can always be described by the following quantum
state [120, 147]:
=

(48)

where the single-particle states |a (i) = fa†(i) |0 and |b(i) =
fb†(i) |0 fulfil a (i) |b(j ) = δa,b δi,j . The number r of nonvanishing expansion coefficients zi defines the Slater rank,
which is unity for non-entangled states, and larger than
unity for entangled states. In other words, elementary
Slater determinants that describe fermions are the analogues
of product states in systems that consist of distinguishable
particles. The state (46) represents—in the antisymmetric case
for fermions—a single Slater determinant and is, therefore,
correctly recognized as non-entangled. The entanglement
measures introduced in section 2.6, based on the distribution
of Schmidt coefficients, can thus, in general, be recovered for
identical particles by consideration of the Slater coefficients
instead.
The convex roof construction (33) for distinguishable
particles can be imported directly, and allows the computation
of entanglement measures for the mixed state of identical
particles. For example, the Schmidt rank of a mixed state
of fermions can be obtained as follows. Given a mixed state
of fermions decomposed into pure states,

Still, the formal notion of entanglement which we
introduced for the case of distinguishable subsystems in
section 2.5 ought to be adjusted, since its na¨ıve application
yields an unphysical form of entanglement, as can be seen by
closer scrutiny of the following, exemplary state:

Similarly as for fermions, a quantum state of two bosons
[121, 140, 144] can be written as

Identical bosons are non-entangled if either the state is
obtained by symmetrization of a product of two orthogonal
states, or if the bosons are prepared in the same, identical
state.
A special case arises when a product of two nonorthogonal states is symmetrized, as illustrated by the
following example. Consider the state

(51)

Again, we call the minimal number r of non-vanishing v˜ j the
bosonic Slater rank. As we will see below, the interpretation
of the Slater rank is not directly analogous to the case of
distinguishable particles, as it was for fermions. The reason
lies in the fact that two bosons can populate the very same
quantum state, which is impossible for fermions and cannot
be modelled within the usual quantum-information framework
laid out in section 2.
3.3.3. Subsystem properties and identical particles. In
physical terms, the concept of properties of particles, discussed
in section 3.1.1, can be adapted to the case of identical
particles by taking into account that the particle label itself
is not a physical property [117, 137, 141]. This fact needs
to be included in the design of the projection operators that
define a complete set of properties [117], in the terminology of
section 3.1.1. Given two particles prepared in a quantum state
| of identical bosons or fermions, we therefore say that one
of the constituents possesses a complete set of properties if,
and only if, there is a one-dimensional projection operator P
on the single-particle Hilbert space H such that

3.3.4. Subsystem properties and entanglement measures.
The physical criteria based on the possession of realistic
properties, as imported above from the case of distinguishable
particles, can be directly related to entanglement measures
such as the Slater rank introduced in section 3.3.2
[117, 137, 141]. Also the von Neumann entropy of the reduced
density matrix of either one of the particles can be used for the
characterization of entanglement, though with some caution,
as already mentioned in section 3.3.2. Here, the interpretation
for identical particles is distinct from the one established for
distinguishable ones. One can finally formulate [117] for
fermions that

(52)

for
EP = P ⊗ (11 − P ) + (11 − P ) ⊗ P ,

(54)

where we assume φ|ψ = 0, and N (α) is an appropriate
normalization constant. The parameter α interpolates between
a symmetrized state of a product of two identical singleparticle quantum states, and the symmetrized product of two
orthogonal states. For α = 0, it corresponds to the state
|φ ⊗ |φ , i.e. a non-entangled state, since we can attribute the
property |φ φ| to both particles. For 0 > α > π/2, two nonorthogonal states are symmetrized, and no projection operator
P that satisfies (52) can be found. In other words, no statement
about ‘at least one particle possesses a certain set of properties’
is possible. Thus, a physical reality can be attributed to none of
the particles, and the state has to be considered entangled. For
α = π/2, the state corresponds to the symmetrized product
of two orthogonal states, one particle possesses the property
P = |ψ ψ|, the other particle possesses Q = |φ φ|, and
the state is hence not entangled.

j =1

| EP |

= N (α)(|φ ⊗ (cos α |φ + sin α |ψ )
+ (cos α |φ + sin α |ψ ) ⊗ |φ )

(53)

where the order of the operators reflects the respective Hilbert
spaces they act on.
The above projection operator can be interpreted as the
projection on the subspace in which one particle possesses
the properties given by P, while the other particle is projected
onto a subspace orthogonal to P. Similarly to the case of nonidentical particles, a particle cannot be entangled with any
other particle if it possesses a complete set of properties9 . This
definition rigorously adapts our discussion of section 3.1.1 to
example (46) in section 3.3.1. Indeed, for the state vector (46),
the projection operator P = |A A| ⊗ |1 1| has the required
properties (52) and (53).
Thus, we come to the following conclusion [137]:
Identical fermions of a composite quantum state are nonentangled if their state is given by the antisymmetrization of a
factorized state.
The case of bosons is more subtle to treat [137]:

is non(i) Slater rank of |
= 1 ⇔ S( (1) ) = 1 ⇔ |
entangled (the state is obtained by antisymmetrization of
a product of two states).
is
(ii) Slater rank of |
> 1 ⇔ S( (1) ) > 1 ⇔ |
entangled (the state is obtained by antisymmetrization
of a sum of products of states).
In contrast to the case of distinguishable particles, the
entropy S( (1) ) is bounded from below by unity instead of zero:
this residual value reflects the mere uncertainty in the particle
label. The analogy between the first case (i) and product
states of distinguishable particles, and between the second
case (ii) and entangled states of distinguishable particles, is
apparent. Note that the antisymmetrization of a product of
two non-orthogonal states gives rise to an unnormalized and
non-entangled state.
For bosons, due to the possibility that the state is obtained
by symmetrization of a product of two non-orthogonal states,
the criterion is more elaborate [117]:

9 We avoid the use of the term ‘separable’, instead of ‘non-entangled’, in the
context of identical particles, since the term ‘separable’ is often used to refer
to the mere mathematical structure of the state, rather than to its possession
of well-defined single-particle properties.

earlier. A posteriori, the internal states of the particles detected
in |L and |R are perfectly anti-correlated, and the Bell
inequality (15) can be violated [151].
We call such choice of detectors OL = |L L| and
OR = |R R| ambiguous, since both particles initially
prepared in the state given by (46) have a finite probability
to trigger each detector, i.e. the detectors have no one-toone relationship to the external states of the particles. This
situation is also illustrated in figure 6: the quantum state is
initially non-entangled according to the above (EPR) criteria,
but the individual spins of the particles measured by the
two detectors are maximally uncertain, and strictly anticorrelated. Thereby, erasure of which-way information takes
place: by the measurement of a particle in the state |L , the
initial preparation of the particle—whether in |A or |B —is
completely obliterated.
An ambiguous choice of the detector setting can thus
induce quantum correlations between the measurement results
at these detectors, even if the initial state (like the one
in (46)) is non-entangled, and no interaction between the
particles has taken place. For an initially entangled state,
the detected particles can result as more or less entangled
[151], depending on the details of the setup. Furthermore,
the statistical behaviour of identical particles upon detection
strongly depends on whether and how they are entangled. For
example, photons prepared in a maximally entangled | − state, see (19), behave like fermions when scattered on an
unbiased beam splitter [152]: when one photon enters each
input port, they will always exit at different ports and never
occupy the same output mode.
We denote this phenomenon—non-vanishing entanglement upon the detection of particles initially prepared in a nonentangled state (according to [141] and (52))—measurementinduced entanglement. This is the characteristic additional
feature encountered when dealing with identical particles and
their entanglement properties.
We retain that in contrast to distinguishable particles,
which can be entangled by deterministic procedures mediated
by mutual interaction, measurement-induced entanglement is

3.4. Measurement-induced entanglement
In the preceding section, we elaborated on a notion of
entanglement for identical particles that follows the spirit of
the original EPR approach [1]: if it is possible to assign
a physical reality (subsystem properties) to the constituent
particles of a composite quantum system, they are considered
as not entangled. When dealing with identical particles,
however, another source of quantum correlations emerges.
In measurement setups that delete which-way information
[149, 150], entanglement can be created between identical
particles without any interaction, in contrast to distinguishable
particles (see section 3.2). In order to understand this,
consider, once again, the quantum state
AB

ˆ R = |R R|

Figure 6. Two particles are initially prepared in two orthogonal
quantum states |A , |B with definite spin values |↑ , |↓ , which
permits the attribution of unambiguous properties to each of them.
They hence both possess a physical reality. However, for ambiguous
detector settings with |B = |L = |A and |B = |R = |A , the
detection of one particle in each detector, |L L| or |R R|, will
come along with wide uncertainty regarding the state of the
measured particles’ spin, due to the deletion of which-way
information in the course of the measurement.

Again the entropy of the reduced density matrix S( (1) )
reflects the uncertainty in the particle label. Due to the
higher occupation numbers allowed for bosons, it is, however,
not bounded from below as for fermions. Note that the
entanglement of a state is directly reflected neither by the
Slater rank nor by the entropy alone: a Slater rank of 2 can
correspond to both an entangled and a non-entangled state.
The two latter cases (v) and (vi) are, again, analogous to the
case of non-entangled and entangled distinguishable particles,
as for fermions. The first two situations (iii) and (iv), however,
can only occur for bosons and do not possess any analogy with
distinguishable particles. They are realized by example (54)
discussed above.

As we have shown above, this state is not entangled according
to the criterion of particles which possess a complete set of
properties. Indeed, we can unambiguously assign the property
P = |A, 1 A, 1| to one of the particles.
Let us now assume, however, that we use two detectors to
measure the particles, and that these detectors do not spatially
project onto |A or |B , but on a linear combination of these
states: we decide to measure
a particle in the external state
√
|L := (|A + |B )/ 2, and
√ another one in the external
state |R := (|A − |B )/ 2, orthogonal to |L . Such
measurement is not deterministic, i.e. not in each realization of
the experiment does one find one particle in each detector. The
internal states of the particles which are possibly registered by
the detectors are no longer determined, i.e. no assignment of
a complete set of properties is possible for particles located in
|L or |R —while before the measurement the state (46) did
not exhibit entanglement, according to our criterion defined

Figure 8. Multiport beam splitter setup to create a four-particle
W -state [172]. The beam splitters (short and thin horizontal lines)
have reflectivities chosen such that the probability for any incoming
photon to exit at any output port is always 1/4. When one particle is
found at each output port, the four-photon polarization state is
described by a four-particle W -state [172]. Note the strict analogy
to the scheme in figure 7.

Disregarding measurement results with two photons in the
same port—described by the first two terms in | fin —which
is known as the post-selection of those detection events with
one particle in each output port (the two last terms in | fin ),
one effectively performs a projection onto the maximally
entangled | − Bell state. Consequently, when analysing
the postselected subset of the total measurement record,
perfect anti-correlations between the measured photons are
encountered [158]. Such a combination of two-particle
interferometry and which-way detection can be used to
entangle any degree of freedom of indistinguishable particles,
whether bosons or fermions [159, 160], or to distinguish
fermionic from bosonic quantum states [161].
Recent
experiments have shown that this scheme works even if the
photons are created independently [162, 163] or measured at
very large distances from each other [164]. These effects lend
themselves to manipulate entangled states by purely quantumstatistical means, i.e. to change their entanglement properties
without the need of any interaction between the constituents
[165–167].
The two-particle Hong–Ou–Mandel effect on which the
above scheme relies can be generalized to an arbitrary number
of input and output ports [168, 169]. This also allows
us to generalize the above scheme to create entanglement
within multipartite systems [170, 171]. Again, one prepares
a non-entangled state of photons in which not all photons
share the same internal state. The particles are scattered
simultaneously on a multiport beam splitter, as illustrated in
figure 8. Detection is conditioned on one particle at each
output port [172, 173]. The which-path information and
thereby the information on the internal state of the photons
that are found at each output port is deleted in the course of the
scattering process, and the state obtained upon detection of the
predefined event (one particle in each output port) is a manyparticle entangled state. Such a situation is illustrated for four
particles in figure 8. It is thus possible to create a multitude
of different multipartite entangled states [172, 174]. Similar
schemes, where the photons propagate in free space rather
than through a beam splitter array, were shown to permit the
preparation of multipartite entangled states through suitable

onto the beam splitter (BS). Upon detection of one photon in either
one of the two detectors, the polarization state of this photon is
unknown, but fully anti-correlated to the polarization of the other
one. Purely quantum correlations are detected when the photons
have perfect overlap in space, time and frequency. Slight deviations
from this ideal case, as suggested in the figure where the overlap of
the transmitted and reflected wave packets is not optimal, jeopardize
the quantum nature of the correlations [151].

intrinsically probabilistic, i.e. the success rate to find one
particle in each detector is strictly smaller than unity.
3.4.1. Entanglement extraction. The abstract principle of
deleting which-way information constitutes the basis for many
applications which exploit the indistinguishability of particles
to create entangled states. Such schemes are widely used, for
example, in today’s quantum optics experiments with photons
(see [29, 30, 153–155] for an inexhaustive list of very recent
state-of-the-art applications). For massive particles, however,
no experiments have been performed yet which implement
analogous ideas, but recent advances in current technology
(see, e.g. [156]) feed the hope that a realization analogous to
the photon experiments will be performed in the near future.
An ambiguous choice of detectors which implements the
scheme of section 3.4 is realized by a simple beam splitter
in a Hong–Ou–Mandel configuration [157]: in the original
experiment, two identical photons fall onto the opposite input
ports of a balanced beam splitter and, due to two-particle
interference, they always leave the setup together at one
output port. Instead of two identical photons, one can inject
a horizontally and a vertically polarized photon [152], as
illustrated in figure 7, i.e. the initial state

settings and detection strategies [175–178]. Indeed, with the
local variation of the polarization states onto which the photons
are projected, it is possible to tune through several families of
entangled states [30], including the large subclass of states that
are symmetric upon exchange of any two subsystems [175,
176]. The induced correlations are not only restricted to the
polarization, but can also be created in motional degrees of
freedom [179].
All the above scenarios rely on the fact that all particles
are identical, and only distinguished through the mode and
the internal state they are initially prepared in, i.e. only
through the property used for discrimination, and the degree
of freedom in which they will be entangled in the final state.
Whenever some discriminating information is available on
output, i.e. when the particles are partially distinguishable,
e.g. due to different arrival times or different energies,
the entanglement in the final state is jeopardized [180–
183]. Instead of a fully quantum-mechanically correlated
state, the state exhibits more and more classical correlations,
and the more so the more distinguishable the particles are.
Indeed, the transition from fully indistinguishable to fully
distinguishable particles used in these schemes corresponds
to a transition from purely quantum-mechanically entangled
to purely classically correlated final states [151].
Besides the intrinsic indistinguishability which is the
very basis of the entanglement strategies described above, it
is also possible to exploit the Pauli principle, and thereby
use the quantum-statistical behaviour of fermions [138], to
create entangled states. Quantum correlations between the
spins of two independent fermions in the conduction band
of a semiconductor are enforced by the Pauli principle,
and selective electron–hole recombination then transfers this
entanglement to the polarization of the emitted photons.

where j1 (x) is the Bessel function of the first kind. We can
interpret (58) as a state of two effectively distinguishable
particles [151], since it describes the spin state of the two
electrons detected by two distinct detectors. Thereby, we can
apply the notions of section 2.
The two-particle state (58) is a Werner state (see (16)) with
the particular property that it cannot violate any Bell inequality
for a large range of f , although it exhibits entanglement [54].
For inter-particle distances x of the order or smaller than
π/(8kF ), we find f (x)2
1/2, and the detected particles
result to be entangled, by virtue of (33). Physically, this
corresponds to the situation in which the Pauli principle
inhibits the detection of both particles with the same spin,
and forces the electrons into an anti-correlated state.
The above consideration allows the extraction of a manyparticle density matrix that describes the spin state of the
detected particles, and permits us to tackle entanglement
between electrons in the Fermi gas under numerous distinct
perspectives. Instead of detecting only two particles, it
is immediate to study multipartite entanglement between
many electrons at different locations [186–189]. Finite
temperatures can be considered [190, 191], and also electron–
electron interactions were included [192, 193], although only
as screened Coulomb interactions in an effective treatment
that provides an approximation to the Fermi liquid. It
is also possible to relax the assumption that the particles
are projected onto position eigenstates [194], and consider
more realistic, coarse-grained measurement devices. All
studies in this area share the conclusion that a rich variety of
entangled states can be extracted, purely due to measurementinduced entanglement, and that such quantum correlations
are not substantially affected when finite temperatures or
screened Coulomb interactions are incorporated in the model.
Hence, the measures for particle entanglement introduced in
section 3.3 are satisfactory in concept, but many dynamical
situations occur in which the detection process itself indeed
induces entanglement between particles, and a treatment that
takes into account measurement-induced entanglement, as
discussed in section 3.4, is more appropriate. This conclusion
is not restricted to the case of a Fermi gas, but the scheme can
be applied to any system of many identical particles.

3.4.2. Entanglement in the Fermi gas. Different types of
entanglement can be considered within a Fermi gas. On
the one hand, electron–hole entanglement can be defined
[184]. Here, we focus, however, on the entanglement
between identical particles, specifically the electrons, in
their spin degree of freedom. This entanglement can be
understood as measurement-induced, similar to what we saw
above. Different studies illustrate how measurement-induced
entanglement is ubiquitous in a scenario in which the particles
are measured in states different from those they were prepared
in, in full analogy to the generic situation described in section
3.4: the Fermi gas is constituted of electrons prepared in
momentum eigenstates, which are then detected in position
eigenstates.
The ground state of a Fermi gas of non-interacting
particles at zero temperature reads

measurement-induced entanglement.

is a necessary condition for entanglement; superconductivity
and entanglement are thus related.
Mode entanglement can be defined analogously for
bosons [200, 201], with the difference that, due to the
unconstrained occupation number, the resulting Hilbert space
is much larger than in the case of fermions.
In general, mode entanglement is strongly dependent
on the way the modes are defined themselves, since any
transformation of mode creation operators

3.5. Mode entanglement
While the above discussion of the entanglement of identical
particles was centred around the correlations between degrees
of freedom carried by particles, one can also define the
entanglement between modes. In this case, it is the very
number of particles which becomes the degree of freedom
in which the entities—the modes—can be entangled. For
example, the state

where aˆ † and bˆ † represent particle creation operators of
modes A and B, is one which exhibits entanglement between
modes A and B (we make the tensor product structure explicit
here): it describes a coherent superposition of two particles
located in A and two particles located in B. The local particle
number in A and B is unknown and exhibits correlations with
the number of particles in the respective other mode.

with unitary U leaves the commutation relations of the creation
operators invariant, while the reduced density matrix for a
single mode will in general change considerably [195]. Indeed,
a transformation such as (64) ought to be considered non-local,
since different modes are brought into coherent superposition
of each other.
While central to the definition of the entanglement of
distinguishable particles, where the term ‘local’ denotes
operations which act on one subsystem alone, the very
concept of locality is indeed difficult to define, let alone
to apply consistently, when dealing with the entanglement
of identical particles or with the entanglement of modes:
the approaches to particle entanglement proposed in [120]—
particle entanglement according to complete sets of properties,
as in section 3.3.1—and in [195]—mode entanglement—are
compared in [202]. The authors come to the conclusion that
the definition based on the Slater rank presented in [120] does
not meet the requirements for an entanglement measure and
is thus inappropriate for the quantification of entanglement
of identical particles, since it is invariant under non-local
operations, while it changes under operations restricted to
one mode. This argument is based on the observation that a
single-particle two-site unitary transformation does not affect
the Slater rank of any non-entangled state and, thus, does
not change its entanglement according to [120], while such
operation can be considered as nonlocal in the sites/modes.
This line of thought shows that particle entanglement is a
concept which does not go well along with the very concept
of locality, since particles can be strongly delocalized and
yet unentangled, in the sense that they individually possess a
complete set of properties (in the EPR sense of section 3.1.1),
as we show in the following: consider, e.g., the passage of
two orthogonally polarized photons through a beam splitter,
as already discussed in section 3.4.1 with equations (55) and
(56), and illustrated in figure 7. The quantum state and its
evolution read

3.5.1. The definition of modes and the problem of locality.
The Pauli principle results in a maximal mode occupation
number one for fermions, so that each mode can only reside
in the state |0 (no fermion) or |1 (one fermion). That is to
say, the Fock-space of m fermionic modes is isomorphic to an
m-qubit Hilbert-space, which is formalized by a map with
the property [195]
:

Uij cˆ j† ,

(63)

k=1

In other words, in order to take into account the fermionic anticommutation relations for distinct sites, cˆ k , cˆ l† = δk,l , the
mapping from the lth creation operator to the raising operator
is non-local in the modes, since it depends on the occupation
numbers of all modes k with k < l. Consequently, also the
action on one mode depends on the occupation of other modes,
and can no longer be considered ‘local’. The difficulties that
arise due to this non-trivial mapping are aggravated by the
impossibility of arbitrary rotations of qubits due to particlenumber conservation (for massive and/or charged fermions,
k nk = const.), or total parity conservation (for excitations,
mod
k nk , 2 = const.). Fermionic mode entanglement can
still be exploited, e.g. for quantum computation purposes when
suitable protocols are designed [197], allowing applications in
close analogy to the unrestricted form of particle entanglement.
Fermionic mode entanglement also possesses a physical
interpretation, since it can be related to different types of

of transformed modes a˜ k,Y
While the particles in the modes populated by a˜ j† can still be
attributed a full set of properties, local measurements in the
modes bk exhibit quantum correlations. The choice of modes
is clearly induced by the experimental setting: measurements
take place on the modes defined by b˜ j† , and since entanglement
is fundamentally defined by the correlations of measurement
results (see section 2.3) the application of an entanglement
measure ought to be performed on the state as described
in terms of the b˜ j† , in the first line of (65), while recasting
the state into the second line’s form is nothing but a formal
manipulation, without a physical counterpart.
When entanglement is not considered within a
measurement setup, the question arises of which is the natural
mode substructure to be considered in order to quantify the
entanglement induced solely by interaction, in a system of
identical particles. A natural choice is given by the eigenstates
of the single-particle Hamiltonian, in the absence of the
interaction part [203]. The resulting mode-entanglement,
when the interaction is turned on again, then originates
uniquely from the interaction terms of the system Hamiltonian
and is not a by-product of the above redefinition of modes.
However, given the indispensable, defining anchoring of
entanglement to correlations of measurement results, such
considerations have a rather formal flavour.

degree of freedom agrees well with studies of entanglement
in the Fermi gas as mentioned in section 3.4.2. In general,
the degree of particle entanglement is found to differ from the
degree of mode entanglement. For example, the entanglement
of particles for two non-interacting bosons in four sites
vanishes, while the entanglement of modes of the same system
adopts a finite value. Such discrepancy can be expected, since
the very carriers of entanglement are different.
3.5.3. Detection of mode-entanglement. The discussion
of the previous section followed the assumption [118] that
coherent superpositions of different particle numbers of
massive particles cannot be detected. This assumption itself
is, however, under debate [204], as we will discuss in the
following. The key issue is best illustrated by the case of a
single, delocalized particle. This simple setting has attracted
much attention during the last few decades from very different
perspectives [209–219]. The debate on whether such state
bears entanglement or not has been intense, and only in the
case of photons the issue can be regarded as thoroughly settled
by experimental verification. Note, however, the fundamental
difference between the massive particle for which conservation
laws imply a SSR, e.g. of charge, and massless particles such as
photons, which can be locally created or destroyed [220], under
the condition that energy, momentum and angular momentum
are conserved.
The controversy arises from the fact that a state of
a delocalized photon, which one obtains, e.g., by simple
scattering on a beam splitter, can be written, in the occupation
number basis, as [204]

3.5.2. Particle entanglement. The physical relevance of
mode entanglement has been an object of intense debate
[204–208], since a particle number superselection rule
(SSR, see section 2.7.2) forbids, in principle, the detection
of coherent superpositions of states of massive particles
with different local particle numbers. While we show in
section 3.5.3 that schemes exist which allow us to circumvent
this problem in some cases for both massless and massive
particles, given a suitable experimental infrastructure, let us
assume for the moment that such equipment is not present,
and that particle-number correlations of massive particles
cannot be regarded as entanglement, as proposed in [118].
The system under consideration allows its modes to have a
variable number of particles, and the particles to carry an
internal degree of freedom. The mode entanglement of a
given state stems from both the entanglement in the particlenumber degree of freedom, i.e. intrinsic mode entanglement,
and entanglement in the internal degree of freedom of the
particles. In order to ensure that only the latter is capitalized
as bona fide entanglement, only the entanglement from
the state’s projection onto states with locally well-defined
particle numbers is computed [118], thus neglecting the
coherent superposition of different particle numbers. The
result then reduces to the entanglement one would assign to
distinguishable spins [139]. Simple models of two bosons
or two spinless fermions distributed over four modes, the
Hubbard dimer, and non-interacting electrons on a lattice are
treated following this convention in [119], with a comparison
to the application of a mode-entanglement measure. For the
electrons on a lattice, the resulting entanglement in the spin

where A, B denote the modes, and |k A/B the occupation

entanglement between modes A and B, but it is fully equivalent
to the application of the following linear combination of
creation operators on the vacuum

for which the entanglement is not as obvious. When expressed
in first quantization, there is, due to the irreducible structure
of the Hilbert space, no place for entanglement at all:

(68)

The choice of modes as the carriers of entanglement suggests,
however, that indeed (66) captures the essential physics of the
problem.
The apparently intuitive argument brought up against the
feasibility to test the non-locality of such a state was that the
detection of the particle at one mode—a necessary requirement
in the experiment—would prohibit the measurement of any
property associated with this very same particle at the other
mode. However, by its construction the verification of nonlocality does rely rather on the wave-like rather than the
particle-like features, which indeed can be probed, as we will
see now.
Proposals to verify a single particle’s mode entanglement
mainly follow two lines, and we review one exemplary setup
for each.

Figure 10. Detection of mode-entanglement with ancilla particles.
A photon is scattered by the beam splitter (solid horizontal line) and
excites coherently either the upper ancilla particle or the lower one,
which are both initially in their ground state |g . A subsequent
read-out of the states of the ancilla particle in different bases reveals
the quantum correlations between them.

Figure 9. Mode entanglement detection with coherent states
[209, 221]. The non-local single photon state is superposed with the
coherent states |α1 and |α2 , respectively, at the two beam splitters
BS1 and BS2. The four detectors are depicted as triangles.

Note, however, that this verification does not rely on
the fact that one uses massless particles: instead of a
coherent state of light, a reservoir such as a BEC can also
be used as a reference state, when massive particles are under
consideration. Thereby, the fundamental SSR for the particle
number, which states that no coherent superpositions of a
different number of particles can be directly measured, can
be circumvented [208, 230–232].

Phase reference via external ancilla states. The first method
relies on coherent states as phase reference [221]: one of
the modes in (66) is superposed, at a beam splitter, with
a coherent state |α in the other mode. A photon detector
that is located at one output port of the beam splitter cannot
distinguish photons which originate from either input mode.
Therefore, the amplitudes for a single photon detection event,
which stem from the single photon mode and from that fed with
the coherent state, are added. The variation of the phase of the
coherent state allows us to project, upon detection of a photon
at one output port of the beam splitter, onto different coherent
superpositions of one and no photon in the input mode. Thus,
the relative phase of the one-particle component |1 with
respect to the no-particle component |0 can be measured, i.e.
one is not restricted to measurements in the basis {|0 , |1 }.
This procedure can be performed on both modes and thereby
permits a full Bell experiment, as illustrated in figure 9. The
setup works analogously when single photon states are used
instead of the coherent states [222, 223], provided a phase
reference is available.
While the very implementation of that setup was not
considered an issue and also acknowledged by critics, it was
argued that the exhibited non-locality is not a property of the
single photon, but intrinsically relies on the coupling to the
coherent states which may bring in additional non-locality
[224–226]. This problem can be circumvented by modifying
the setup such that the coherent states that are used are totally
uncorrelated [213]: if the reference states are created by the
observers themselves in an independent way, no additional
quantum correlations can be induced. The phase relation
between the coherent states is crucial for the functioning of
the scheme, but it can also be achieved by purely classical
communication.
Experimentally, mode entanglement was finally verified,
closely following the original proposal [221], in [227, 228]
with photons delocalized in space, and in [229] for photons
delocalized in time.

Transfer of mode entanglement onto ancilla particles. The
second method for the verification of mode-entanglement does
not require coherent states as a reference, but introduces ancilla
particles, which acquire the information whether the mode was
populated or not, in a coherent way. A subsequent readout of
the state of the ancilla particles can then violate locality. In
contrast to the above setup using coherent reference states, the
issue of creation or annihilation of massive particles (ruled out
by a fundamental SSR) is more intricate here, as we will see
below. The basic idea is strongly influenced by a proposal
for entangling gates in quantum computation [233] and can be
described as follows: consider the state [204, 220, 234]
√1 (|0, 1 A,B

A,B )

⊗ |g, g ,

(69)

where |i, j A,B represent the state of the modes in which i
particles are prepared in mode A, and j particles are prepared
in mode B. The state |g, g describes two ancilla particles
in their ground state, locally coupled to the modes A and B,
respectively. If an interaction between the particles prepared
in the modes and the ancilla particles takes place, such that
the latter become excited upon the presence of a particle in the
respective mode, the full system’s quantum state will evolve
into
√1
2

(70)

due to the coherent absorption of the delocalized particle
by the ancilla particle coupled to A or to B. The setup
is schematically depicted in figure 10. The entanglement
which was present as mode-entanglement is transferred to the
entanglement between the two ancilla particles which can be
verified by the usual means, under the assumption that no
19

Topical Review

SSR inhibits the measurement of coherent superpositions of
|e and |g [235]. Hence, by simple interaction with ancillae,
the inaccessible mode entanglement can be transferred to an
unconstrained degree of freedom. A realistic scenario based on
this idea was proposed for cavity-QED experiments in [236],
and successfully implemented, e.g., in [237] (see [238] for a
review of related cavity-QED experiments). Other methods for
the realization of the proposal include the storage and retrieval
of quantum information of one single delocalized photon in an
atomic ensemble [239].
As insinuated above, it is important to note that the
absorption of the particle is indeed crucial for the entanglement
between the ancilla particles. If the particle is not absorbed,
the final state reads
√1 (|0, 1 A,B
2

⊗ |g, e + |1, 0

⊗ |e, g ),

3.5.4. Creation of mode entanglement. Since a simple
transformation of modes can create a mode-entangled state,
it is not surprising that a panoply of scenarios have been
designed to produce highly mode entangled multipartite states
[249–253]. All these schemes build on linear optics and on
single-photon detectors, hence, consist of transformations of
the modes and of projective measurements. In principle, the
dimensionality of the subsystem states and the number of
parties of a multipartite quantum state which can be obtained
with a limited number of particles is unbounded [253]. Indeed,
entanglement was verified, e.g., for a four-partite state created
with only one single photon [254].
3.6. Entangled degrees of freedom

(71)

Given the physical carriers of entanglement, it remains to
choose the degrees of freedom that define the subsystem
Hilbert spaces. The spectra associated with these degrees
of freedom can be finite and discrete, infinite and discrete,
continuous, or composed of both a discrete and a continuous
part. In general, any degree of freedom which can be
measured in different bases, i.e. which is not subjected to
an uncircumventable SSR (see section 2.7.2), is a candidate
to exhibit measurable entanglement. The actual choice
is, however, often determined by the actually achievable
experimental control over the respective degrees of freedom.
Photons are particularly versatile carriers of entanglement,
since they were shown to exhibit entanglement in various,
distinct degrees of freedom.
The most prominent
example is certainly their polarization degree of freedom.
Already before the prevalence of parametric down-conversion
[255] which represents today’s most versatile source
for polarization-entangled photons, the implementation of
quantum-informational protocols [256] was mainly tested
with polarization-entangled photons stemming from the twophoton decay of excited atomic states [7, 8]. Other degrees
of freedom which support higher-dimensional Hilbert spaces
can equally well exhibit entanglement: the orbital angular
momentum [257, 258], the position and momentum [259], the
time [164] or the frequency axis [260].
Entanglement need not involve the same degree of
freedom in each subsystem, even though these may be
represented by identical physical entities (such as photons,
ions, molecules).
If the degree of freedom that is
entangled differs between the subsystems, one talks of hybrid
entanglement. For example, the polarization of a photon can
be entangled to the momentum of another one [261, 262], the
arrival time to the polarization [263], or the orbital angular
momentum to the polarization [264].
Hyperentanglement (or multiparameter entanglement)
denotes quantum correlations that involve several or even all
different degrees of freedom of a single physical particle:
any particle in a hyperentangled state is correlated not
only in one degree of freedom such as polarization, but in
several. Hyperentanglement was successfully demonstrated
for photons, including two photons that are hyperentangled
in three degrees of freedom, namely in their polarization,
in their longitudinal momentum, and in their mode [265].

and the density matrix that describes the state of the ancilla
particles is a fully mixed state which contains only classical
correlations, due to the remaining entanglement with the
delocalized particle. One may argue that this problem can
be circumvented if that particle is again measured in a
coherent superposition of the modes √12 (|A ± |B ), after it
has interacted with the ancilla particles. In this case, the ancilla
state again remains in an entangled state √12 (|e, g ± |g, e ).
The last projective measurement, however, can only be
performed after the modes have been superposed at a beam
splitter and constitutes a global measurement on the system.
Hence, the requirements for a rigorous proof of non-locality
by the violation of a Bell inequality are not given [230].
It is to be retained that a rigorous experimental proof
for the non-locality of mode-entanglement of photons has
been achieved, as discussed above [227, 228]. Moreover,
single-photon entanglement has also been purified [240], and
theoretical schemes for the detection of entanglement in oneparticle many-mode entangled states are available [241].
For massive particles, the issue is more intricate, since the
SSR which inhibits the local rotation of bases is of fundamental
nature (see [234] for an illustration of the analogies between
massless and massive particles). As a way out, a pure reservoir
state with broad particle distribution can be shown to be a
good reference frame to circumvent the particle number SSR
[116, 208, 242], in general. Since the reservoir state in the
scheme in [208] is shared by the two parties to ensure phase
coherence, no strict non-locality conditions are established.
Furthermore, the quantum correlations that are measured may
have their origin in the entanglement between spatial regions
of the reference state, and not necessarily in the coherent
delocalization of a single massive particle. Also in this latter
case, however, a Bell inequality violation signals the modeentanglement of massive particles, either stemming from
the single delocalized particle or from the reservoir. Other
proposals circumvent the particle-number SSR by using two
identical copies of the state under consideration, such that one
copy provides a phase reference for the other one [243], and no
coupling to a particle reservoir is necessary. The advancement
of experimental techniques in the field of ultracold atoms
[244–247], where mode entanglement is naturally present
[248], feed the hope that the issue of mode entanglement of
massive particles will be resolved in the near future.

Topical Review

Analogous experiments with photons entangled in frequency,
wave vector and polarization were reported in [266, 267]. The
use of several degrees of freedom of each particle naturally
allows us to realize high-dimensional states with few particles;
hence, more information can be encoded in few carriers. One
impressive example is given by the 1024-dimensional, tenqubit hyperentangled state of photons in [268], where both
the polarization and the mode degree of freedom define the
subsystem structure.

very existence and their strength. On the other hand, the
advances of experimental technologies have brought coherent
phenomena in atomic processes on the experimentalists’
agenda [269–271]. Today, a complete mapping of the
momenta of all fragmentation products is possible, and very
strong and particular correlations have indeed been recorded
(see section 4.6). The question whether the interaction
between fragments or between fragments and the environment
causes the deterioration of entanglement to merely classical
correlations in the final (detected) state or whether rigorously
quantum correlations persist is, however, open. It constitutes
both a challenge for the theory which needs to account for
decoherence, and for the experiment, in which one currently
cannot perform a rotation of basis in momentum/position
space. While several means are available for quantifying
correlations, the nature of those, classical or quantum, has to
be assessed with Bell inequalities or by novel proposals such as
the persistence of Cohen–Fano interferences for fragmenting
molecules, discussed in section 4.5 [272].

4. Atoms and molecules
In terms of the different facets entanglement can exhibit, as
well as of the related conceptual issues which need to be
dealt with, atoms and molecules represent fascinating physical
objects which bear all of the difficulties that were discussed
in sections 2 and 3. In most hitherto existing experiments,
however, these systems were isolated and shielded from their
environment, and most degrees of freedom were neglected
and decoupled from the ones of interest, so as to realize
the quantum-information abstraction of two qubits with great
success. However, atoms and molecules naturally offer several
other ways to encode entanglement, ranging from atoms that
are entangled with each other in their centre of mass degree of
freedom (see section 4.1), over photons emitted in the course of
a de-excitation or of a recombination process (see sections 4.2
and 4.3), to the very constituents of the atoms, i.e. to electrons
entangled with nuclei (section 4.4), or electrons entangled with
each other (section 4.5). Thereby, they provide unique testing
grounds for the direct application of the conceptual tools we
discussed above.
The studies that we will review hereafter employ the
same physical object, but they illuminate very different
aspects of entanglement, and they are motivated by different
incitements. For unbound systems such as the products
of a decay process, means were established to quantify
correlations and experimentally accessible observables were
proposed. For bound systems, the direct verification of
entanglement is out of reach: prior to any measurement,
the fragmentation of the system has to be induced by some
mechanism which necessarily impacts heavily on the quantum
correlations of the constituents, and thereby strongly changes
their entanglement properties. Alternatively, consequences
of entanglement between the constituents of bound systems
for other physical phenomena such as the bosonic or
fermionic compound behaviour were identified, and thereby
indirect means for the verification of entanglement were
established. Finally, entanglement provides a benchmark for
approximation techniques in bound many-body systems, e.g.
electronic entanglement assesses the strength of the exchangecorrelation energy in density functional theory [49].
A particular case is the motional entanglement between
atomic or molecular fragments.
The conservation of
momentum and energy, and the isotropy of the system
enforces highly correlated fragmentation dynamics in threedimensional configuration space. The kinematic nature of
these correlations in atomic and molecular fragmentation
processes provides a rather intuitive understanding of their

4.1. Entanglement between atoms
Dichotomic, or qubit-like, entanglement between the internal
(electronic) states of trapped ions is well established and
documented (see e.g. [273] or [46] for a review on the
entanglement of trapped ions), while entanglement in the
motional degrees of freedom has only started to receive
substantial attention [179, 274–277].
One proposal to create and verify entanglement in atomic
momenta involves the Feshbach dissociation of a diatomic,
ultracold molecule [278, 279]. Two subsequent magnetic field
pulses coherently prepare a molecule in a dissociating state
which is given as the superposition of an ‘early’ and a ‘late’
particle pair (one single pulse does not suffice to dissociate the
molecule deterministically), as illustrated in figure 11. The
resulting quantum state of the atomic fragments after the two
pulses can thus be written as
|

=

√1
2

(|e, e + |l, l ) ,

(72)

where |e and |l denote the quantum states of an atom released
by the early or by the late pulse, respectively. This state
has the form of the Bell state given by (20) and can be
considered as time-bin entangled, a type of entanglement that
was already verified for photons [164]. This dissociation time
entangled state can be probed by correlation measurements in
different bases, in a Mach–Zehnder interferometer [280, 281],
such as to test a Bell inequality. The interferometer can be
substituted by proper adjustment of the magnetic field pulse
shapes, such that the late pair has a larger momentum than the
early one, and interference between the early and late wave
packets occurs naturally. By increasing the delay between the
dissociating pulses and thereby between the wave-packets, the
technique bears the potential to investigate the length scales
over which massive particles can be coherently delocalized.
With more intricate pulse protocols, e.g. the dissociation
of the molecule with three or more subsequent pulses into
three or more pairs, also entanglement of massive particles
involving larger dimensions should in principle be accessible.

A bottleneck for the experimental realization of such protocols
is the reproducibility of the magnetic pulse sequence for the
dissociation of the molecules: this is a crucial ingredient to
ensure a stable relative phase between the early and the late
component. On the other hand, the two interferometers do not
need to have a fixed relative phase, which allows macroscopic
separations. Additionally, no spatial nor temporal resolution is
required for the particle detection. For the proposed molecular
BEC produced from a balanced spin mixture of fermionic 6 Li,
a temporal separation of τ = 1 s between the early and the
late component and a dissociation velocity of vrel = 1 cm s−1
are feasible [279].

elementary scattering process in which entanglement between
the light field and the atom can be studied.
4.2.1. Decoherence of atoms due to photon emission. Such
correlations in the momentum of a spontaneously emitted
photon with the momentum of the remaining atom, which
originate from momentum conservation in the spontaneousemission process, were measured in [288]. In general,
when photons are spontaneously emitted by atoms, the latter
effectively lose their coherence, which leads to an observable
loss of fringe visibility [289, 290] in interference experiments.
This decoherence of the atomic states can be explained by the
entanglement of the atoms with the emitted photons and the
subsequent loss of these photons and of the information they
carry. Formally, this loss corresponds to a partial trace over the
photonic degree of freedom, leaving the atom in a mixed state
without the potential to exhibit interference. This situation
should be contrasted to the scenario discussed in section 3.4,
in which the emitted photons are detected in a way that their
which-way information is lost, and the atoms remain mutually
entangled.

4.2. Atom–photon entanglement
While the entanglement between particles of different
kinds represents the conceptually simplest case (see
section 3.1.1) and naturally occurs in all interacting
systems, it was experimentally verified only recently.
A paradigmatic example is provided by two electronic
energy levels of an atom (a ‘two-level atom’) and a
photon which populates a single mode of the quantized
electromagnetic field. Such bipartite qubit-entanglement
has been realized in cavity-QED [238] and in cold atom
experiments [282–287]. Since experiment and theory of this
conceptually (not experimentally, though!) rather elementary
scenario are well established and documented [238], we focus
here on advances in high-dimensional entanglement in the
external degrees of freedom, e.g. in the momenta of atoms and
photons.
In contrast to molecules that first need to be dissociated by
some external field, in order to provide two separate subunits,
already the simple spontaneous decay of an electronically
excited atom under emission of a single photon constitutes an

4.2.2. Occurrence and strength of atom–photon entanglement.
Under the assumption that the atom has infinite mass and
that it is described by a δ-localized wavefunction [291], no
motional entanglement between the photon and the atom
can arise, simply because the atom is fixed in space. A
theoretical treatment of the spontaneous decay of an excited
atom with emission of one photon shows that entanglement
is naturally present in the atom–photon system [292, 293]
when the aforementioned idealization is given up. Like in the
case of a bound hydrogen atom discussed in section 2.7.1, the
two-particle wavefunction can be written in a factorized, i.e.

This argument can be made quantitative by studying the
coincident probability distribution P (rph , rat , t) of the photon
(ph) and the atom (at), which are obtained by fixing the position
of one detector while varying the position of the other, and by
counting only coincident signals from both detectors. From
the joined atom–photon probability distribution P (rph , rat , t),
the marginal distributions can be obtained:

the centre-of-mass-like and relative coordinates of the atom–
photon system, respectively (the collective coordinates). On

(j )
the other hand, χat and χph refer to the atom and the
photon wavefunction, respectively. For a physical choice of
subsystems, namely of the atom and the photon, however,
entanglement is exhibited, as also immediate from the second
line of (73). Once again, the choice of subsystems is the key
issue, as already discussed in section 2.7.1. Such motional
entanglement, as quantified by the Schmidt number K (see
equation (27)), is, in principle, unbounded since position and
momentum are continuous degrees of freedom [295]. In
practice, however, only a finite number of discrete Schmidt
modes are occupied, i.e. the entanglement is typically rather
low (in terms of section 2.6, only a few Schmidt coefficients
λj do not vanish). This can be understood from a kinematic
argument which takes into account the mass discrepancy
between the atom and the emitted photon, and the restriction
of available phase-space due to momentum conservation. The
Schmidt number of the resulting atom–photon entangled state
turns out to be inversely proportional to the line width of
the transition [292]. This can be understood intuitively:
the narrower the transition, the better defined the energy of
the compound photon–atom system, and the more strongly
the photon is correlated to the recoiling atom. Specific
three-level scattering schemes [296] could, in principle,
enhance the resulting entanglement between atom and
photon [293, 297, 298].
As an elementary scattering process, the atom–photon
system constitutes hence a rather well-understood scenario in
which correlations are naturally present, and their strength can
be understood from kinematic arguments and conservation
laws. Due to this kinematic nature of their genesis, it is, again,
the probing of the coherences of the many-particle state that
constitutes the biggest experimental challenge.

then quantifies the correlations of the wavefunctions and,
thereby, the spatial wave-packet narrowing: a smaller
width in coincident detection as compared to the marginal
distribution is a consequence of correlations; by construction,
R(t)
1. Wave-packet narrowing can also be understood
as ‘measurement-induced localization’ [300]. For t = 0, R
corresponds to the Schmidt number K (see equation (27)):
K = R(t = 0). The entanglement inscribed into the system,
and thereby the value of K, necessarily remain constant, since
the particles are non-interacting. However, the spreading
of wave packets leads to temporally increasing R(t) with t
[299]. The presented scheme probes, however, no coherences,
but only correlations, as immediate from the probability
distributions given only in terms of position coordinates. Only
if both the momentum and the position can be measured, does
a full realization of the EPR paradox become feasible [301].

4.2.3.
Coincidence measurements and wave-packet
narrowing.
Under the assumption that all observed
correlations are of quantum nature, i.e. that the quantum state
under consideration is a pure state, correlations in position
can be used to quantify the entanglement between the atom
and the photon [294, 299]. This very assumption is, however,
debatable, since an analysis based on correlations recorded
in one specific basis does not allow us to exclude a merely
classically correlated state (see section 2.3).
Anomalous narrowing and broadening of the atomic and
photon wave packets can be quantified by coincidence and
single-particle measurement schemes [294]. In other words,
when the position of the nucleus is known, the state of the
photon is largely determined, whereas without the information
on the nucleus’ state, the width of the observed photonic
wavepacket is considerably larger.

4.2.4. Decoherence of the photon–atom system. The
interaction of the atom with other background photons
subsequent to photon emission leads to the decoherence of
the entangled atom–photon system [298]. The timescale
tdis of disentanglement can be estimated by modelling
the environment as the background photon bath. It turns
out to be inversely proportional to the average number of
resonant photons in the heat bath and can thus be increased
by decreasing the temperature of the environment. On the
other hand, the disentanglement time tdis is also inversely
proportional to the Schmidt number K. Hence, the timescale
depends itself on the initial entanglement of the state, and the
more entangled the state, the faster its entanglement is lost.
The inclusion of other single-body coherent effects like the
dispersion of the atomic wave packet is shown to be of no
relevance for the entanglement in the system [293].

emitted, the entanglement between their polarization degrees
of freedom strongly depends on the relative angle of emission
[305, 306], as also shown in figure 12. It is also apparent that
the photons also exhibit angular correlations, i.e. they are not
emitted isotropically.
In the non-relativistic dipole approximation, the
Schr¨odinger equation is solved under the assumption of the
interaction of the electrons with a spatially homogeneous
electric field (the wavelength of the photon is much larger
than the dimension of the atom) [324]. In this model, the
polarization state of the two photons can simply be written as
[306, 325]
1
(78)
| 2γ =
(|H, H + cos θ |V , V ) ,
1 + cos2 θ
where |H and |V denote horizontal and vertical polarization
with respect to the emission plane of the photons, θ is
their opening angle and the factor 1/(1 + cos2 θ ) ensures
normalization. For back-to-back emission, i.e. θ = π , the
state is maximally entangled, while perpendicular emission,
i.e. θ = π/2, leads to a non-entangled two-photon state.
The entanglement properties of a photon pair emitted in such
extreme configuration (θ = π or θ = π/2) can also be
derived by taking into account uniquely the conservation of
angular momentum; they hence do not provide information
about microscopic details of the decay process.
Whereas, in practice, the total two-photon decay rates are
dominated by the dipole transition and higher multipoles do
not contribute significantly, the latter can have a considerable
influence on the correlations that are carried by the emitted
photons. The inclusion of relativistic and non-dipole effects—
in an approach based on the relativistic Dirac equation in
which the electric field is not assumed to be spatially constant
[326]—leads to a prediction that significantly differs from
(78) [308, 309, 327]. In particular, the symmetry of the
emission with respect to θ = π/2, evident from (78), is broken
by non-dipole contributions. This effect is further enhanced
for large nuclear charges Z. Hence, multipole and relativistic
effects do not only manifest in strictly dipole-forbidden decay
channels [325].
In an experiment, the initial state preparation of the atoms
or ions is typically not under perfect control, and one needs to
account for an incoherent mixture of the magnetic sublevels.
This mixedness can jeopardize the entanglement in the final
photonic state. The 2s1/2 → 1s1/2 transition, however, is
unaffected by the incoherent population of magnetic sublevels:
due to angular momentum conversation, the final two-photon
state remains pure. In contrast, the incoherent preparation of
the initial state leads to a mixed final state for the 3d5/2 → 1s1/2
transition. The resulting, mixed two-photon state is of Werner
type (see section 2.3), under certain geometries [328].
Beyond correlations in the polarization degree of freedom,
entanglement also prevails in other degrees of freedom. For
example, the photon–photon emission angle is correlated
with the polarization of one photon—independently of the
polarization of the other one [329], i.e. the system exhibits
hybrid entanglement, similarly as in the studies discussed in
section 3.6. As concerns the verification of the quantum nature
of such correlations, a change of basis is achievable in the

4.3. Photon–photon entanglement
Two-photon emission in de-excitation transitions in atoms and
ions has been the first source of polarization-entangled photons
[7, 8, 302–304]. Due to conservation of energy, momentum
and angular momentum, photon pairs that are emitted in such
processes are, however, not only entangled in polarization,
but also highly correlated in energy and angular direction
(i.e. in frequency and linear momentum). Correlations are
not only present within identical degrees of freedom, but the
system also exhibits hybrid entanglement (see section 3.6),
i.e. entanglement between different degrees of freedom such
as the polarization of one photon and the angular direction
of the other. Furthermore, the strength of polarizationentanglement may depend on the emission angle, on the
fraction of the available energy carried by one photon and on
the nuclear charge, as shown in the theoretical studies reviewed
hereafter [305–309].
4.3.1. Experimental progress. Experimental studies of
the correlations of photons emitted in a two-photon decay
have recently concentrated on highly charged ions for which
relativistic effects become important. For such systems,
only the total decay rates and excited state life times
were available until two decades ago [310, 311]. The
spectral distribution of the emitted photons was resolved later
[312–314], and today the spectrum of the two photons emitted,
e.g., in the recombination of K-shell vacancies of silver [315]
and gold [316] can be measured, and are found in agreement
with theoretical predictions [317]. Indeed, the experimental
accuracy is sufficient to verify relativistic effects, e.g. in the
two-photon spectrum of He-like tin [318].
This important progress in the experimental capabilities
[319, 320] permits today to detect photons in a wide range
of energies, and to extract differential cross-sections as a
function of the energy redistribution among the photons, and
of the opening angle, even for photons in the x-ray regime.
Also the polarization of hard x-rays, for example, in radiative
electron capture into the K-shell of highly-charged uranium
ions [321, 322], becomes accessible. In the next few years,
the observation of polarization-correlations of photons in the
x-ray domain is therefore likely to become possible. Thus,
experiments analogous to those which measure correlations of
low-energetic photons in transition processes of light atomic
species, as already performed three decades ago [7, 8, 302],
will soon be feasible for heavy nuclei and for photons in
the x-ray regime. These developments have triggered an
extensive research agenda with the goal to fully characterize
the emitted photon pair [323] in general atomic two-photon
decay processes.
4.3.2.
Theoretical studies. The first issue that was
addressed by theoretical studies is the dependence of the
photon polarization properties on the emission properties,
i.e. instead of back-to-back emission, an arbitrary geometry
was considered. Already the polarization of a single emitted
photon depends on its emission angle with respect to the
polarization axis of the atom [307]. If two photons are

balanced fragment masses results in stronger entanglement
[50]. In this investigation, besides the momentum of the
incident photon, also the Coulomb interaction in the final state
is neglected; hence, the effect of the possible deterioration of
entanglement due to interaction is not taken into account. The
evolution of the state and of the entanglement between the two
particles is thereby constrained by the free-particle two-body
momentum and energy conservation.

polarization degree of freedom, though in the angle a change
of basis was realized so far only for photons in the optical
range [330, 331].
The above studies have shown that photon–photon
entanglement may display a much more intricate behaviour
than one would expect by considering the conservation of
angular momentum alone. Relativistic effects significantly
alter the symmetry properties of the system, and thereby lead
to observable consequences in the angular correlations and the
polarization entanglement. An inclusion of many-body effects
[332] into the theory promises the future design of probes of
effects like parity violation [333].

4.4.1. Bound systems: composite behaviour. Electrons
bound by a nucleus are naturally entangled with it in their
external degrees of freedom [103]. As we will discuss
hereafter, such entanglement between the constituents of any
bound system can be related to the compound’s bosonic
or fermionic behaviour and thereby provides an important
indicator for the strength of effects due to the composite
nature of particles. With the experimental realization of
Bose–Einstein condensation (BEC) with bosonic atoms, the
question naturally arises to what extent composite particles
can be treated as elementary bosons [334], and under which
conditions the underlying constituents, i.e. the electrons, will
manifest themselves and jeopardize the bosonic behaviour
of the compound. Intuitively, one would relate the density
of such composite particles to their bosonic or fermionic
behaviour: roughly speaking, if the wavefunctions of the

4.4. Entanglement between electrons and nuclei
The choice of electrons and nuclei as carriers of entanglement
allows us to consider bound systems as well as fragmented
ones. The fragmented systems exhibit close analogies to
the arguments presented in section 4.2, where photon–atom
entanglement is discussed, adding final-state interaction and
of the finite mass of the electron to the problem. Again
kinematic intuition can explain the strength of momentum
correlations: the discrepancy of the masses of the electron
and the nucleus leads to a rather low value of entanglement,
whereas an analogous scenario of dissociating molecules with

electrons of different atoms start to overlap considerably,
one would expect their fermionic character to inhibit the
composite system to behave as a boson. An upper limit
for the occupation number of composite boson states was
derived formalizing this idea [335] and applied to the problem
of trapped hydrogen atoms. Typical maximal occupation
numbers of the ground state are shown to lie in the range of
1013 , while current experiments reach 106 –109 , well below this
bound. Composite bosonic behaviour is, on the other hand,
not restricted to systems in which the constituents are close
in space and bound by interaction: also non-interacting and
spatially separated biphotons can exhibit composite-particle
properties, as demonstrated by experiments measuring the de
Broglie wavelength of an ensemble of entangled photons,
defined as λ/n where λ is the average wavelength of the
photons, and n the average number of photons in the ensemble
[336, 337]. Hence, compositeness is not limited to spatially
bounded particles; the density of particles and the overlap
of the wavefunctions of the constituents cannot constitute a
universal criterion for composite behaviour.
The entanglement between the constituent particles
provides such a key quantity that defines to what extent
the bosonic/fermionic commutation relations for creation
operators of composite particles are valid [338, 339]. Given a
composite system C of two particles of types A and B, which
are either both fermions or bosons, the compound quantum
state can be written in the Schmidt decomposition as

coefficients and, consequently, also the expectation value
of .
For the hydrogen atom, it can be shown that the particle
density above which bosonic behaviour breaks down, as
obtained by such entanglement-based analysis [339], roughly
corresponds to the value previously derived in [335]. The
formalism can also be applied to other composite bosons such
as Cooper pairs [340], and to the behaviour of non-elementary
fermions [341].
The above treatment of the composite behaviour has
shown that certain problems can have a universal solution
under a quantum-information perspective that is not restricted
to a particular situation. Furthermore, the composite behaviour
can, in principle, be probed experimentally, and thereby the
entanglement between constituents becomes accessible even
without the breakup of the whole system.
4.5. Electron–electron entanglement
Electrons as potential carriers of entanglement provide a
rich Hilbert space structure with bound and unbound spectra
of compounds. They can carry entanglement in their spin
and spatial degrees of freedom, and entanglement can result
from interactions, or it can be induced by measurements
[151, 185]. Due to the prevalence of the long-range,
inter-electronic Coulomb interaction over spin–spin effects,
however, most theoretical studies concentrate on the
entanglement in spatial (external) degrees of freedom. Since
the electron–electron interaction varies in relative strength with
respect to the electron–nucleus interaction, depending on the
charge of the nucleus, both theory and experiment can, in
principle, access very different regimes. Indistinguishability
plays an important role, since the electronic wavefunctions
typically overlap in space and the (anti)symmetrization of the
spatial part of the wavefunction thereby becomes relevant.
Both the rigorous theoretical description and the
experimental verification of entanglement remain, however, a
difficult challenge in this setting: in the experiment, the spins
of ejected electrons cannot be measured since the methods
known from solid-state physics [47] cannot be directly
implemented for free electrons. For entanglement verification
in the external degrees of freedom, a measurement in a second
basis in addition to momentum cannot be implemented with
state-of-the-art technology, since the realization of a basis
rotation analogous to the one realized for photons in [330, 331]
needs the implementation of electron lenses with strengths
much superior than currently available. One is therefore
restricted to measurements of mere momentum correlations.
In theory, the many-body wavefunction for many-electron
atoms is necessary for entanglement studies. While first steps
were performed which allow the computation of the degree of
entanglement via the electron density in special models such
as the fermionic Hubbard model [342, 343], such treatment is,
up to now, not available for atoms. The computation of the
realistic many-particle wavefunction requires, however, large
if not prohibitive numerical effort. Due to the non-integrability
of any non-hydrogen-like atom, theoretical studies of multielectron systems have, so far, mainly focused on exactly

the creation/annihilation operators cˆ † and cˆ are not strictly

many composite C-particles, it turns out that the Schmidt
number K, (27), is a direct indicator for the composite
behaviour. The quotient N/K, where N is the number of
composite C-particles in one quantum state, needs to be
very small in comparison to unity in order for the composite
particles to behave as bosons, i.e. the larger the entanglement,
the better the composite particle behaves as a boson. This can
also be retraced intuitively from the structure of in (82): this

solvable model atoms. While such models differ strongly
from real multielectron atoms—as concerns the interelectronic
interaction and the definition of the confining potential, they
allow insight in some qualitative features. They also constitute
a testing ground for approximate techniques [344–347] which
may help us to study entanglement in more realistic atomic
models in the future.

the spins (parallel or antiparallel) which is a relevant parameter
for entanglement, as evaluated with the help of the properties
of the single-particle reduced density matrix. The electron–
electron entanglement vanishes in the ground state for τ → 0,
and it is maximal for τ → ∞. For the excited states,
however, the entanglement shows discontinuous behaviour at
τ = 0: in the limit of very small interactions, i.e. τ → 0, the
entanglement remains finite in the case of antiparallel spins;
only for τ = 0 is the system non-entangled again. In this
case, the system is non-entangled due to the degeneracy of
energy-eigenstates. In contrast, for parallel spins, the system
always shows continuous behaviour in the limit of small
relative interaction strengths and vanishes for τ → 0. As
demonstrated by this study [351], the indistinguishability of
particles adds qualitatively new features as compared to the
model of distinguishable particles. A physical explanation for
the exhibited, rather intricate behaviour has, however, not yet
been achieved.

4.5.1. Harmonic confinement and interaction: the Moshinsky
atom. One exactly solvable model system for two bound
electrons is the Moshinsky atom [348, 349] which was initially
introduced to characterize the reliability of the Hartree–Fock
approximation in interacting systems. In the model, both
the confinement and the interaction are harmonic. The

4.5.2. Coulombic interactions. The harmonic interactions
considered in the last section permitted an analytical treatment
of the model atoms and a straightforward evaluation of
entanglement measures. The next step towards a more
realistic scenario consists in including the Coulomb interaction
into the model. Already for two electrons bound by one
nucleus, however, an analytical treatment is impossible,
and the numerical treatment is difficult due to the triple
collision singularity, i.e. the attractive fixed point of the
classical phase-space flow for which both electrons fall into
the nucleus, symmetrically, along the collinear axis. Only
strongly simplified models have been in the focus of recent
studies. Since the nonregularizable triple collision singularity
constitutes one of the dynamical key features of the threebody Coulomb problem [352–355], its neglect eliminates one
of the sources of classically chaotic dynamics in the threebody dynamics. Chaos, however, implies the abundance of
avoided crossings on the spectral level, and the latter have
been shown to be associated with entanglement in interacting
many-particle systems [356].
One-dimensional helium is studied in [357], where the
two electrons are restricted to a one-dimensional space, such
that they are always on opposite sides of the nucleus (the eZeconfiguration). Effectively, one deals with a one-dimensional
atom with charge Z = 2 and two spin-free electrons. The
Hamiltonian thus reads

respectively, which permits a closed analytic solution of the
problem: the wavefunction factorizes into these coordinates,
and can be written as
|nrel , nCM = |nrel ⊗ |nCM ,

(85)

where the quantum numbers nrel and nCM denote the
excitation in the relative and in the centre-of-mass coordinate,
respectively.
The relative strength τ = ω/
of the
interelectronic interaction determines the reliability of the
Hartree–Fock calculation. For τ = 1, the ground-state energy
in the Hartree–Fock approximation amounts to approximately
95% of the exact value [348]. This is consistent with an
overlap of 94% between the exact and the Hartree–Fock
wavefunction [349].
Some basic intuition for the particle entanglement in this
system is gained under the assumption that the electrons are
distinguishable and do not carry spin [350]. Then only the
relative strength of the interelectronic interaction τ affects the
entanglement of the electrons. The entropy of the one-electron
reduced density matrix, (30), can be extracted for the ground
state by purely analytical means and grows monotonically
with τ .
A slightly more complex model is realized by taking into
account the spin degree of freedom and the indistinguishability
of electrons [351]. Due to vanishing spin–spin and spin–
orbit interaction, the total wavefunction factorizes in a spatial,
φ(x1 , x2 ), and a spin component, χ (σ1 , σ2 ). The symmetry
of the spin-part of the wavefunction directly governs the
symmetry of the spatial part, since the two terms must be of
opposite parity in order to obtain an antisymmetric compound
wavefunction. Due to this dependence, one would expect that
the parity of the spin part thereby governs the entanglement of
the system, but it turns out that it is the relative orientation of

and it is diagonalized numerically. The electrons always
remain spatially separated, no overlap of their wavefunctions
in space can occur and thereby the indistinguishability does
not play any role. The singularity between the electrons and
their vanishing overlap does not prevent entanglement being
generated, and, again, the entanglement grows with the state’s
energy.
Other simplified model atoms include the Crandall atom
(harmonic confinement and 1/r 2 -interaction) and the Hooke
atom (harmonic confinement and Coulomb interaction, a
good description for two electrons in a quantum dot) [358].
The indistinguishability and the spin degree of freedom of
the particles were included, but no spin–orbit interaction.
The features already encountered for the Moshinsky atom
in [351] were reproduced qualitatively by both models: the
entanglement grows with relative interaction strength and
with the excitation. For antiparallel spins, the limit of
vanishing interaction strengths does not necessarily yield a
non-entangled state. The entanglement measures in [358] are
identical to those used in [351], and it remains open whether
this discontinuity effect has to be considered an artefact of the
entanglement measures that are used, or whether a physical
explanation will be provided in future.
A numerical study of entanglement [358] can also be
performed on helium-like atoms using eigenfunctions of the
Kinoshita type [359], which are a modification of the Hylleraas
expansion [360]. In the study [358], the wavefunction is
approximated with functions of the following form [361]:

Conclusions. In general, while the quantum
information tools presented in section 2 are today available to
study the entanglement of electrons in atoms, the complexity
of many-electron atoms has not yet permitted a quantitative
and realistic treatment. Still, a consistent picture that provides
kinematic intuition emerges from the available studies: the
entanglement grows, as expected, with the interaction between
the electrons and with the energy, or principal quantum
number, of the state. This observation is consistent with the
fact that the Hartree–Fock approximation deteriorates when
one considers highly excited states [348]. These properties
are contained in all models that were considered so far.
Also a growing spatial separation of two particles is not a
direct indicator for a smaller degree of entanglement they
exhibit. Indeed, in the above models, the typical distance
grows with larger energies, and so does the entanglement.
Given the qualitative agreement of all existing studies, this
tendency is expected to persist in future studies with more
accurate electronic wavefunctions. However, with the onset
of chaotic dynamics, qualitatively new features can be
expected [356, 364–367].
The state energy and entanglement were also shown to
be not always monotonically dependent on each other, even
in these simplified models [351]. Entanglement thus offers
an additional, independent analytical quantity in the study of
atoms. The interplay of interaction and indistinguishability
of particles has led to interesting first results which we,
however, do not yet have intuitive understanding for. It is
unclear how the indistinguishability will manifest in systems
for which more degrees of freedom, spin–orbit coupling and
other relativistic effects are incorporated.

where s = |r1 | + |r2 |, t = |r1 | − |r2 | and u = |r1 − r2 | naturally
satisfy the triangle inequality s
u
|t|. The exponent
χ , the mixing coefficients {cj } and the non-negative integers
{lj , mj , nj } are parameters that are determined numerically
[361]. The entanglement of the ground state is again lower than
the entanglement of the triplet or singlet excited states. The
ground-state entanglement decreases with increasing nuclear
charge Z, which can be understood, again, as caused by the
relative decrease of the electron–electron interaction strength.

4.5.5. Entanglement of ionized electrons. In the process
of single-photon double-ionization of atoms [368], a Werner
state in the spins [54] emerges (see equation (16)). In the case
of vanishing coupling between spins and angular momenta,
the entanglement of the final state is fully determined by
conservation laws and thereby totally independent of the
details of the process. It can thus be inferred by the sole
knowledge of the electrons’ energies. In contrast, spin–orbit
interaction induces dependences of the entanglement on the
incident photon’s polarization [369]. The same argument
also applies for the spin correlations of electrons ejected in
the photoionization of linear molecules [370]: they turn out
to be widely independent of their spatial correlations, and,
in the absence of spin-dependent interactions, the degree of
entanglement can be predicted entirely from conservation
laws. It does, however, sensitively depend on the kinematic
details of the process when spin–orbit interactions are included
and thereby spatial symmetries are broken.

4.5.3. Quantum critical points. A connection between the
behaviour of entanglement at quantum critical points and at
the ionization threshold in a few-electron atom is drawn in
[362] for the entanglement in the ground state of a spherical
helium model in which the Coulombic repulsion between
electrons is replaced by its spherical average. In this, again,
effectively one-dimensional model, the von Neumann entropy
(see (30)) of the reduced density matrix of one electron in
the helium ground state exhibits singular behaviour at the
critical point, i.e. for the value of Z for which the system
becomes unbound. For the excited triplet state [363], the
scaling properties of the von Neumann entropy is shown to be
qualitatively different: due to the opposite symmetry of the

delocalized over two separated nuclei, whereas its absence
would indicate that the state needs to be described by a
classical mixture. In this sense, Cohen–Fano interferences
witness mode-entanglement of a single delocalized electron.
Such a state of two separated nuclei and a single electron
that is in a coherent superposition of being bound by either
one of them realizes single-particle mode entanglement (see
section 3.5), this time, however, with a massive, charged
particle. The experimental proposal hence opens a route to
probe whether there are bounds to the distances over which
massive particles can be delocalized, and its realization bears
the potential to contribute to the debate on mode-entanglement
mentioned in section 3.5.

4.6. Experiments with electrons: from two-centre
interference to two-particle correlations
The above theoretical studies on entanglement between the
spins of ejected electrons show again that a simple picture
based on conservation laws has to be refined when a
more realistic and intricate interaction is considered. The
verification of spin correlations between ejected electrons is,
however, out of reach for current technology. In contrast,
experimental progress has permitted detailed measurements
of momentum correlations between electrons, as we discuss
hereafter.
4.6.1.
Cohen–Fano interference.
The two-centre
interference of single electrons has been a subject of
intense theoretical and experimental studies.
With the
advance of reaction microscopes, the implementation of
the original proposal of the Cohen–Fano interference in
the photo-ionization of molecules has finally become possible.
Oscillations were predicted in the cross-section which depend
on the ejection angle of the photoelectron with respect
to the molecular axis [371]. These can be interpreted
as the result of the interference of two inequivalent paths
induced by the presence of the two nuclear centres and the
previous delocalization of the electron at these two centres.
Interference patterns, predicted by theoretical calculations
of the photoionization of homonuclear molecules (see, e.g.,
[372, 373] for recent discussions) could be verified in
experiments that use photoionization [374] or other scattering
mechanisms such as impact ionization [375–378]. The
mechanisms which lead to the breakdown of the interference
pattern are also rather well understood. For asymmetric
molecular configurations, partial localization of the emitted
electrons takes place [379], as also probed experimentally
for CO2 in [380]. Due to the breaking of the symmetry, a
preferred direction emerges which also leads to an asymmetric
electron emission. Such asymmetry can also be induced
for homonuclear molecules simply by the polarization of the
absorbed photon [381].
In such processes, also decoherence of the single-electron
states plays an important role [382]. In order to observe the
interference pattern, the wavelengths of the directly ejected and
the scattered wave need to coincide, and an interaction with one
centre which affects one of the pathways can jeopardize this
coherence. Indeed, for large kinetic energies, the interaction
at one centre is strong enough to inhibit interference of the two
pathways, and the interference pattern is lost.
Despite being a single-particle interference effect, a
connection of Cohen–Fano interference to entanglement was
recently proposed in [272]. The scheme aims at probing the
delocalization of the electronic wavefunction over separated
nuclei and thereby at probing the persistence of mode
entanglement. The pump–probe protocol first dissociates a H+2
molecule. After a certain delay time, in which the fragments
fly apart, the probe pulse eventually also photoionizes the
fragments and the ejected electron is recorded. The persistence
of Cohen–Fano interferences for large delay times would show
that even at large internuclear distance the electron can be well

4.6.2. Two-electron measurements. The success in the
verification of coherent single-particle effects [382] has
recently also lead to a consideration of the impact of
coherent many-particle phenomena. The treatment of the
photo-induced breakup of the H2 -molecule was proposed in
[383] and experimentally performed in [28] using the cold
target recoil ion momentum spectroscopy (COLTRIMS) [384]
technique. In this experiment, molecular hydrogen is doubly
photoionized, and all reaction products are collected, such
that a full reconstruction of all momenta takes place. This
also enables measurement of the orientation of the molecule
in space, and thereby the emission angles of the electrons with
respect to the molecular axis. The data show that when energy
sharing between the electrons is very unbalanced, i.e. one
electron acquires a much larger kinetic energy than the other
one, both electrons exhibit a Cohen–Fano-like interference
pattern in their direction of emission. If, however, the electrons
share the kinetic energy in a more balanced way, the singleelectron interference pattern vanishes. This can be understood
from the interaction between the electrons that is important
in such a range of energy sharing. If the data are filtered
(postselected) to a given emission angle of one electron, an
interference pattern re-emerges for the other one, i.e. the
electrons are strongly correlated. The data, reproduced here
in figure 13, thereby suggest that entanglement between the
outgoing electrons is responsible for the correlations that are
visible between their emission angles. Such interference was
observed for the same setting also in the sum of electron
momenta [385]. It is visible in the momentum distribution of
the individual electrons only for extremely asymmetric energy
sharing, while it always persists for the sum of moments.
The evidence of entanglement in these experiments is
rather strong: instead of probing a purely kinematic effect, the
persistence of single-particle interference is assessed. Indeed,
particles lose their ability to exhibit perfect interference fringes
when they are entangled to other particles. By the selection
of the electrons in certain ranges of energy sharing, one
can effectively select different regimes of mutual interaction
strength. Thereby, it is probed how the interaction between the
electrons affects the interference pattern. On the other hand,
only observables which commute with the momenta of the
electrons are measured and, strictly speaking, the correlations
that are found can also be reproduced by local realistic theories,
similarly as discussed in (93).

again, measured. No information on any expectation value
of observables that do not commute with the momentum is
obtained, and the a posteriori conditioning on a certain angle
does not correspond to an active choice of different, noncommuting observables. The requirements for the violation
of a Bell inequality (see section 2.3) are therefore not met.
Strictly speaking, the data currently cannot rule out a separable
mixed state of the following form:

4.6.3.
Entanglement and symmetry breaking.
An
entanglement-based study proposes a resolution to the
question whether a core vacancy created in a diatomic
homonuclear molecule by ionization is localized at one centre,
or delocalized. By photo double ionization of N2 and
collection of both the photoelectron and the subsequently
ejected Auger electron, it was shown [386] that the two
electrons are, again, highly correlated: if conditioned on
the photoelectron to be emitted in the direction of the
molecular axis, the remaining Auger-electron is left distributed
asymmetrically. In contrast, if the photoelectron is detected
perpendicularly to the molecular axis, i.e. without any
preferred direction, also the Auger electron seems to be
ejected from a delocalized state, as suggested by its angular
distribution. This is clearly observed in the data shown
in figure 14. Hence, the electrons are anti-correlated,
independently of the choice of the emission direction of the
first one. The filter that fixes the emission direction to a certain
angle can be interpreted as a choice of basis from either left and
right localized states {|L , |R } or even and odd, delocalized
states {|E , |O }. The latter are defined as follows for Auger
(A) and photo (P) electrons:

where pi are the probability weights of the respective pure
states. This state describes a purely probabilistic mixture
of anti-correlated electron pairs and corresponds to a localrealistic model which simulates the acquired data and does
not require entanglement. These equations reflect again very
directly the problem of distinguishing a classical mixture, as
given in (1), from a coherent superposition as in (2), when
only the correlations in one basis are measured.

In fact deeply rooted in atomic physics that initially stimulated
the very development of quantum mechanics, entanglement
has now largely overcome its restriction to the reductionist
form of bipartite qubit correlations of some internal degree of
freedom. It is a phenomenon sought under natural conditions
which has become a tool for the deeper understanding for
naturally occurring, typically complex systems, and thereby
returns to its very conceptual origins. Simultaneously, it
provides an analytic tool for many-body phenomena that are
difficult to understand in terms of single-particle observables.
Given a fixed subsystem structure, a versatile
mathematical apparatus, insinuated in section 2, is available
today for the characterization of entanglement, despite

The electrons seem to be neither localized nor delocalized, but
in an entangled state such that the condition of (de)localization
imposed on one electron implies the (de)localization of the
other. As a simple model, we can consistently describe the

identical particles, discussed in section 3, turned out not to
possess a universal solution which can be applied like an
all-purpose tool to all possible situations. Knowledge on
the physical setup and the observables under consideration
and, especially, on the restrictions which potentially apply for
measurements is necessary to find the suitable treatment in a
given scenario.
First studies on entanglement in bound systems of
electrons have emerged, in which, however, the combined
effects of the particles’ indistinguishability, the long-range
character of the Coulomb interaction and the spin–orbit
coupling have not yet been fully incorporated. Where
the electrons’ indistinguishability was taken into account,
the very intrinsic feature of identical particles, however,
i.e. measurement-induced entanglement (see section 3.4),
has not yet found applications in interacting systems apart
from a Fermi gas model with screened Coulomb interaction
which does not affect the spins, i.e. the degree of freedom
in which entanglement is considered [192, 193]. While,
conceptually, the possession of a complete set of properties
defines a physical reality and characterizes a separable subunit,
measurement-induced entanglement beyond the engineered
examples mentioned in section 3.4.1 can be expected in
many situations, e.g., between electrons ejected from the
same orbital quantum state. In systems in which both the
particles’ indistinguishability and their mutual interaction play
a prominent role, effects that cannot be explained in terms of
one of these aspects alone and hence require the understanding
of their subtle interplay can be expected [387].
As opposed to bound systems in which entanglement is
present due to a permanent binding interaction, the unbound
decaying systems we have reviewed typically share the same
physical reason for the existence of quantum correlations:
conservation laws for energy and momentum leave the
fragments entangled in these very degrees of freedom, at any
range of energy, from Feshbach-resonance-induced decay of
ultracold molecules [279] in the very low energy range, to
electron–positron pairs created at very high photon energies
[388]. A quite intuitive feature is that the degree of
entanglement between products which are very unbalanced
in mass tends to be smaller than between constituents of
similar properties, simply due to kinematics and conservation
of momentum. This rule of thumb can, however, be
circumvented with suitable schemes [293, 297], which shows
that entanglement adds a qualitatively new feature to the
description of dynamical systems which cannot be completely
reduced to kinematical quantities. The understanding of
entanglement is hence by far not completed by considering
the kinematics of processes. The very distinction between
classical and quantum correlations and the mechanisms which
lead to the breakdown of coherences remain the most important
issues that need to be addressed. The quantification of wavepacket narrowing emerged as a tool for the verification of
correlations between the fragments. It holds the disadvantage
that it only provides a clear signature for entanglement under
the assumption of pure quantum states, i.e. it cannot distinguish
classical and quantum correlations. Correlations were indeed
recently verified [28, 386], however, in the momentum
probability distribution rather than position.

Topical Review

Beyond the application in atomic and molecular physics,
the conceptual issues we have discussed also arise in the
presently very active field of quantum effects in biological
systems. The question whether coherent effects play a relevant
role for biological phenomena has arisen and is under debate
[21, 51, 389]. Experimental evidence for the role of coherence
in light-harvesting complexes, responsible for the functioning
of photosynthesis, was recently obtained [390–392] and has
triggered intensive research activities in theory [17–19, 393–
398]. Simultaneously, theoretical results support the idea of
surviving dynamical entanglement at room temperature in an
environment prohibitive for entanglement in static systems
[20, 399, 400], which feeds the hope to encounter coherent
effects in other noisy, wet and warm systems. The importance
of multipartite entanglement [18] as well as of molecular
vibrations [401] for efficient energy transport in networks was
also shown recently and contributes to the picture that quantum
effects in biology could play an important functional role.
All this is evidence that the fields of quantum information
and of atomic and molecular physics have only started
to interact. The reason is twofold: on the one hand,
the experimental capabilities that permit to resolve and
verify coherent phenomena have only emerged recently
[269], and, on the other hand, conceptual issues inhibited
the direct application of the highly abstract and idealized
notions of quantum information science to this field. First
successful applications of the concepts borrowed from
quantum information yielded interesting results and new
insights into the dynamics of atoms and molecules and
provided answers to fundamental questions, e.g. regarding the
delocalization and entanglement of massive particles in nature.
The study of many-particle quantum coherence in atomic and
molecular physics promises further interesting results in the
next few years, and will eventually lead to vital feedback to
the field of quantum information itself.
