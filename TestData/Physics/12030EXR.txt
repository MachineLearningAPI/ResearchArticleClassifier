Abstract
The objective of this project is to create clean fuel for transportation using hydrogen
powered by solar energy. Hydrogen has been generated by solar photovoltaic (PV) array
and then collected for data analysis to demonstrate efficiency of the hydrogen production
in all the steps of the experiment. The hydrogen produced from the electrolysis process
was either stored in a metal hydride canister or directly fed into Proton Exchange
Membrane (PEM) Fuel Cell to generate electricity. A hydrogen fuel cell remote control
car has successfully designed, and demonstrates at least one hour operation per hydrogen
charging at room temperature.
Keywords: Solar Energy, Hydrogen Production, Electrolysis, PEM Fuel Cell, Clean Fuel

1. Introduction
Looking back in to history, it is clear
that renewable energy research has
received the greatest quantity of funding
during the gas price or availability
crises1. The main source of energy for
150 years has been fossil fuels, e.g.
petroleum. However, the world is
running out of this source rapidly and
there are detrimental effects of its use
e.g. pollution and economic impact2. A
source without the dangerous byproducts (greenhouse gases like CO2,
CO, HC etc.) that is available at all times
and renewable is needed: the answer is
“hydrogen” energy; the purpose of this
work is to supply clean energy to a
remote control car. The system shows
that water electrolysis, powered by solar
energy, creates hydrogen3. This chemical

energy then can be converted into
mechanical energy to power a remote
control car. The hydrogen can then be
stored or transported. In this cycle,
hydrogen is an energy carrier, which
allows storage and transportation of
inexhaustible solar energy4.
Petroleum has been a great resource
and is widely used in many applications,
like transportation and stationary
generation of electricity. Many of these
applications are of huge importance to
the world. However, dependency on
petroleum is a big problem for society
because it is a non-renewable and
polluting source. Since petroleum is nonrenewable, it will deplete in only a
matter of time. So the big question is
“What will the world use for
transportation or distribution when
petroleum runs out?”

As mentioned above, petroleum is
one of the most significant and important
resources for transportation. Nowadays,
most means of transportation use
petroleum, such as cars, airplanes,
motorcycles, and boats5. Engineers and
scientists have been working hard trying
to find other sources of energy that they
can use to replace petroleum. The world
has many renewable resources such as
solar, wind, rain, tides and geothermal
heat which are naturally replenished.
The technologies associated with these
natural energies are solar power, wind
power, hydroelectricity, biomass and
biofuels for transportation purposes.
Natural energy can help alleviate the
world’s petroleum shortage. There have
been a few new developments such as
the electric car and the solar powered
car. Solar hydrogen fuel cell cars are one
of the newest developments in progress
today6.
Hydrogen is a renewable source
without hazardous byproducts. More
importantly, hydrogen is a source
regenerating fuel; it can be produced
from water, intermediately stored, and
finally used in either internal combustion
engines or fuel cells to burn back to
water. It is believed that if hydrogen
solar cars are successfully developed and
deployed; it will represent a huge
milestone for renewable energies and the
world will be safe from the ever
threatening global warming effect7-9. It
will be energy efficient with the
advantage of storing hydrogen reversibly
in solid state materials, e.g. metal
hydrides, carbon nanotubes, polymers
and chemical complexes10.
2. Experimental Investigations
Two important components of this
project are (i) photovoltaics (PV) and (ii)

MS12030EXR

electrolysis. A total of thirteen solar
panels (arrays) are utilized for this
present study11. The first array has 117
modules with each angled at 5 degrees.
The second array has 130 modules with
each angled at 15 degrees. The third one
has 130 modules with each angled at 25
degrees. For this project, solar PV in
array #1 was used to get the best
performance for the production of
hydrogen and oxygen. Additionally,
array #1 provided an easy access for
connection because it was designed for
direct
current,
utility
grid
interconnection, capable of delivering a
41.6A max current and 240V max
voltage. For this particular project, only
one solar PV of array #1 was utilized to
produce 23V max voltage and 3A max
current.
Electrolyzers on the other hand, are
the other main components of this
particular
design
for
producing
hydrogen. An electrolyzer uses a solid
polymer electrolyte to transfer protons
and water. When combined with
catalysts,
a
membrane–electrode
assembly is formed. Then power is
supplied by a source such as solar
photovoltaic. The electrolyzer then
decomposes water and produces
hydrogen and oxygen gases. The system
converts water into gaseous hydrogen
and oxygen using electrolysis, creating
heat with no hazardous by-products as
represented by the overall chemical
reaction3 2H2O + Electrical Energy
(from Solar PV) Æ 2H2 + O2.
To obtain hydrogen by this
mechanism, six electrolyzers were
placed in series as shown in Figure 1.
These electrolyzers are capable of
utilizing various electrical sources such
as solar, hydro, turbine, etc. to produce
hydrogen and oxygen. Hydrogen can be
used to power fuel cells and oxygen can

be released back in to the atmosphere. In
this particular experiment, hydrogen was

MS12030EXR

used to power a remote control car.

Figure 1: Hydrogen production set up using solar PV electrolysis
After creating hydrogen from the
solar PV, the hydrogen car was designed
and built without using conventional
batteries. The fabrication of the car
began by calculating the potential
voltage and current required to power
the remote control car. It was determined
that the car would power at 6 volts and 2
amps. These calculations helped to

determine that a fuel cell which
generates at least 12 watts of power was
needed.

Technologies in Singapore had exactly
what the design required and was able to
ship the hydrogen fuel cell kit at a short
notice. The current-voltage (I-V)
characteristics of the fuel cell are shown
in Figure 2.

The second step was to design a fluid
system that could transfer hydrogen
from a high pressure tank to low
pressure
(metal
hydride)
tank.
Swagelok13 coupling devices (Figure
3(a)) made of stainless steel that could
withstand high pressure over 5000 psig
were used to do this. These devices are
also capable of transporting flammable
gases such as hydrogen. This particular
design could withstand high pressures
(pre-tested with 300 psig), but even with
high pressure viability, safety was still
an important factor when experimenting
with such flammable gases.
The third step was to activate the
metal hydride tanks (20L standard).

MS12030EXR

Each tank contains 100 grams of a metal
hydride (e.g. LaNi5 type) that acts as a
sponge for hydrogen sorption after it is
activated. To activate this metal hydride,
the tanks were connected to the fluid
design. Then the low pressure regulator
was set to 30 bar (435 psig). After
waiting 80 minutes, the pressure was
released to about 10 bar (100 psig) and
increased the hydrogen pressure back to
thirty bars. This process was repeated
four times. After activation was
complete, the tanks were refueled and
reconnected to the fluid system with the
low pressure reading set to 30 bars. After
30 minutes of leak testing (see Figure
3(b)), each tank was disconnected.

Figure 3: (a) Metal hydride canister connected to high pressure H2 tank via Swagelok
coupling; (b) Metal hydride canister leak testing with high H2 pressure charging.
Finally the remote control car would
be tested by connecting the hydrogen
fuel cell to the car. The car was
successfully demonstrated and ran just
as a battery power remote control car
would have (see Figure 4). Also, it was
observed that the hydrogen fueled car
lasted for about 1 hour while the battery
powered car lasted only 30 minutes with
six AA batteries (9V).

Because the average voltage output of
this fuel cell is 6V, it does not meet the
full requirement for this car and causes it
to run slower. To run this car adequately,
a better fuel cell with output of 9 V
should be used or 3 more volts should be
added to the fuel cell.

Figure 4: Hydrogen from metal hydride canister-Fuel Cell14 remote control car
In our experiment, we tried to
generate the remaining 3V using
modular solar panel. By adding this solar
panel to the fuel cell in series,
theoretically the problem should be
solved and the car should run
satisfactorily. However, this did not
work in practice. So, we added a 3V
battery and the car worked perfectly.
The resulting conclusion was that the car
needed a continuous power supply to
work properly. (There were minor
problems with producing an adequate
flow rate from the H2 tanks. To produce
a constant flow rate of H2, the metal
hydride tank needed to have more heat
(since hydrogen release from metal
hydrides associated with endothermic
process) but the H2 was causing the tank
to become cooler so an adequate ambient
temperature was difficult to achieve.

3. Results and Discussion
Total hydrogen amount and flow rate
could be determined by the volumetric
water displacement method as shown
previously in Figure 1. Hydrogen
production flow rate was recorded every
50 ml until 1 L was reached. Six
separate trials were done to assure
accuracy. The rate of hydrogen
production with time is shown in Figure
5. In addition, at each 50ml data point,
voltage provided from the solar panels
was calculated as well as the current and
time. This data was used to illustrate the
relationship between the voltage, current
and power of the fuel cell and is depicted
in Figure 6. Next, efficiency was
calculated by determining the amount of
hydrogen generated from a gallon of deionized (DI) water.

The approximate amount of hydrogen
produced from one gallon of water (at 1
atmosphere pressure and at 32 degrees
Fahrenheit) was 1250 gallons. The
volume was 4.7 m3 or about 3 ft x 3 ft x
15 ft. The wattage needed depends
solely on the current flow. 16.5 KWhours of energy were required to convert
1 gallon of water to hydrogen. If an
apparatus used 1000 watts, then the
hydrogen could be generated in less than
a day. However, the current required is
too high to do electrolysis at this rate in
a normal household. An industrial line
would most likely be needed. Hydrogen
could be generated at a slower rate with
the wattage on a 10 A or 20 A circuit,

MS12030EXR

since the conversion would still work,
but it would take a longer time.
The final and most important
calculation was the Energy Efficiency.
The efficiency was calculated in four
different stages based on the data
tabulated in Table 1 (see also Appendix
1): Solar PV, Electrolyzers, Fuel Cell,
DC motor (see also Figure 7). We have
calculated and tabulated the efficiencies
and total system efficiency based on the
formulas given below. Solar PV driven
water electrolysis produced the hydrogen
production of about 6000 ml of
hydrogen in a total time of 236 minutes
(see Appendix 2 for calculation).

Project Safety and Cost:
Project safety was monitored and
guidelines adhered to in every step of the
design and development. Since working
with flammable gas like hydrogen can
cause severe damage, the safety
vulnerabilities were identified15. It is
claimed that storing hydrogen in solid
state metal hydrides is safer when
compared to either high pressure (300-

500 bars) gaseous hydrogen storage or
low temperature (21K) liquid hydrogen
storage16. In the current project design,
the solar-hydrogen driven fuel cell car,
was modified and constructed to house
an important component, a metal hydride
canister to store and release hydrogen
gas.
Hydrogen production and conversion
was very costly because of the high cost

17 March 2013

of components like electrolyzers, a fuel
cell, and a hydrogen tank. HydrogenFuel Cell vehicles were at least two to
three times more expensive in
comparison to the battery operated
systems. Hopefully, when hydrogen

MS12030EXR

solar cars are out of the experimental
stage and the units are mass produced in
industry, the cost will eventually go
down. The prices for each material or

4. Conclusions
The design enabled successful
production of hydrogen by utilizing
solar energy and this hydrogen was
successfully used to power a remote
control car. The total efficiency of the
system was estimated to be 2.35%,
which
is
comparable
to
the
manufacturer’s specifications (3.74%).
In addition, the basic concept of design
and its functionality was evaluated
critically through the duration of the
project. The efficiency of fuel cell
performance has been found to be drop
substantially from the initial run due to
various factors such (i) power output
from the solar photovoltaic cells, (ii)
loss of voltage and current between
electrolyzers (iii) total effective power
output from the fuel cell stack. The

$200

recent developments in this research
area raised some hopes for fueling the
future with hydrogen. In conclusion,
solar energy is available readily at no
cost to produce hydrogen; therefore, it
may lead to a future clean alternative
fuel (hydrogen) for transportation. In
our future work, we will investigate and
understand the mechanisms required to
improve the hydrogen fuel cell
efficiencies by evaluating the rate
limiting factors in (i) solar PV
electrolysis for hydrogen production, (ii)
light-weight, high density hydrogen
storage and delivery systems.
