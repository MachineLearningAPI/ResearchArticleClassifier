n vivo wireless biomedical microsystems fueled by the continued scaling of
electronic components and the development of new microsensors and micropackaging technologies is rapidly changing the landscape of the electronics
and medical industry. These devices can be used for a myriad of monitoring,
diagnostic, therapeutic, and interventional applications that range from the well
known cardiac pacemakers and defibrillators to emerging applications in visual prosthesis, brain computer interfaces (BCIs), and embedded monitoring of a variety of medical useful variables such as oxygen, glucose, pH level, pressure, and core temperature.
This article presents a brief overview of design considerations for implementing wireless power and data interfaces for in vivo biomedical devices. Examples of emerging
implantable and ingestible wireless biomedical devices are discussed.

Parameterization of Hardware Challenges
The requirements imposed on in vivo biomedical devices are application specific, but
the framework for hardware implementation shares a common set of constraints in size,
power, and functionality. The interplay between these constraints determines the available processing bandwidth for the front-end electronics, the operating time in battery
powered implants, and the communication range and bandwidth of the wireless link.
Figure 1 shows an example parameterization of various biomedical technologies in
terms of size, power, and functionality. Restricting the overall size of the biomedical

device can impact the functional specifications, power
efficiency, and compute capacity of the entire system.
For instance, battery-operated devices with stringent
size restrictions (,10 mm2) are functionally limited by
the size of the battery and hence the available capacity,
peak power handling capability and overall lifetime.
In addition, the size restrictions also limit the attainable radiation efficiencies of electrically small antennas,
thereby affecting the power budget of the communication link. Increased system functionality such as
higher sensor channel resolution, channel count, computational bandwidth, and transmission data rates
generally implies higher power dissipation and larger
implant size. Thus, from a hardware perspective,
design considerations are driven by trade-offs in size,
power, and system functionality, wherein highly functional, ultralow-power, and miniature in vivo devices
are generally most challenging.

Wireless Power and Data Links
Inductive Links
Wireless powering of implantable electronics is commonly achieved via low-frequency inductive links [1],
[2], as at low frequency the magnetic fields are well
penetrable in biological media [3]. However, because
the magnetic field strength over the coil axis falls as a
third power of distance, this type of link is suitable only
for very small distances. Several studies have been conducted to measure the mutual inductance between two
air-coupled coils [4], [5]. Coupling strength is dependent
on coil loading, excitation frequency, coaxial alignment,
coil separation, coil geometry, and angular alignment.
Most of these are subject to variations and typical values for coil-coupling are between 0.01 and 0.2.

Figure 2 shows the basic components of an inductively coupled power and bidirectional data telemetry
link using a primary external inductor and a secondary implant inductor. The extracorporeal transmitter
typically consists of a class-E amplifier owing to the
high-achievable efficiencies (.95%) and ability to
induce large voltages (that is, 50–200 V) across the primary coil from a relatively low-voltage power source
such as a battery [6]. On the implant side, the induced
voltage that appears in the secondary coil is generally passively resonated using a capacitor to boost the
voltage and then rectified and regulated to provide a
clean supply for the on-chip electronics. Forward data
telemetry towards the implant is commonly implemented by modulating the envelope of the power carrier to create detectable changes in the secondary coil.
Reverse telemetry or backtelemetry from the implant
toward the external unit is generally based on the load
modulation technique, also known as “load shift keying” [1], [2], [7], wherein the reflected impedance in
the primary coil is modulated by changing the impedance seen by the secondary coil. To minimize radio
frequency (RF) heating due to tissue absorption, these
inductive links are generally operated below 10 MHz
with typical output power ranging from 10–250 mW,
and practical achievable data-rates of 1–2 Mb/s [8].

Low-Power Data Telemetry
The design complexity and power dissipation of telemetry links for in vivo biomedical devices depends on
numerous factors, including but not limited to the
desired operating range, implant size, location of the
implant in the body, data rate, frequency, and regulatory
standards. For very-short-range links (that is, 1–10 s of
centimeters), low-frequency inductive links provide a

Recommendations of safety levels with respect to
human exposure to radio frequency electromagnetic
fields are described in IEEE Standard C95.1-2005 [21].
These recommendations are expressed in terms of maximum permission exposures (MPEs) and specific absorption ratio (SAR) values. For instance, the SAR localized
MPE is 2 W/kg averaged over six minutes. The SAR can
be expressed in terms of SAR 5 sE2/r, where s is the
tissue conductivity (S/m), r is the tissue density (kg/
m3) and E is the root mean square (rms) electric field
strength in tissue (V/m). For power transfer via inductive links, the resulting RF heating of the tissue is a primary safety concern. In general, tissue temperature rise
must be kept to less than 1–2 8C to avoid cellular damage in sensitive areas such as the brain [22].

Power (mW)

Antennas for small-scale implants play an important role in determining the transmission loss and
power budget of the RF link and thus the energy efficiency of the overall hardware platform [16]. Among
the primary design considerations are in vivo losses
due to tissue absorption, antenna size, and choice in
operating frequency. For a critical review of the electrical properties of biological tissue in the body, see
[17]. To illustrate the effect of tissue absorption as a
function of frequency, normalized radiated near field
contour plots generated by a small zig-zag dipole
antenna placed inside the stomach are shown in Figure 5 for FCC approved 402–405MHz for MICS, the
902–928 MHz, 2.4–2.483 GHz and 5.725–5.875 GHz
industrial-scientific-medical (ISM) frequency bands
[18]. A finite difference time domain (FDTD) tool from
REMCOM Inc with a complete electrical model with 23
different tissue types of an average American male was
used to determine the radiation characteristics [19]. In
this example, the optimal radiation frequency lies near
the 900 MHz band, as at lower frequencies the antenna
is an inefficient radiator due to its size, and at higher
frequencies tissue absorption losses dominate. Similar
results are reported in [20]. Thus, while most biomedical links operate at much lower frequencies, the optimal choice of frequency depends on the size and type
of antenna and its location in the body.

receivers with higher sensitivity dissipate more power

introduction of the first pacemakers in the 1950s, the
complexity of the implant system has increased from a

and extreme low-power operation to last 10–12 years
from a single primary battery [23]–[25]. An example

through a vein into the heart, are used to stimulate
the heart by carrying electrical impulses from the
pacemaker device. As shown in Figure 6, the leads are
also used to sense cardiac signals, which are subsequently amplified, filtered, and digitized to monitor
the patient’s heart rate and provide stimulation when
required. The pacemaker integrated circuit (IC) is composed of a sensing system which consists of amplifiers,
filters and analog-to-digital converter (ADC); a highvoltage multiplier and output stage for generating the
stimulation pulses; a battery management system,
wireless inductive link, and bias/reference generators; and signal processor that implement algorithms
for therapy and timing control. As reported in [26], the
200 k transistor IC fabricated in a 0.5 mm 3P-3M process
occupies 49 mm2 and consumes only 8 mW; deep subthreshold designs and switched-capacitor techniques
are widely used for low-power operation.
Unlike the implantable cardiac pacemakers used
to treat pathological conditions known collectively
as heart block, that is, cardiac arrhythmias such as
bradycardia (slow heart rate), wherein the heart’s
natural pacemaking function is assisted using relatively low-voltage stimulation pulses (5–10 V) [27],
implantable automatic defibrillators are able to
deliver high-energy pulses of approximately 30–35 J
at 750 V for ,4–8 ms in duration [23], [28]. The
implantable defibrillator is a life support device that
continuously monitors the patient’s heart rhythm for
abnormally fast heart rate, or tachycardia, and uncoordinated and disorganized heart rhythms known
is cardiac fibrillation. When the device detects an
abnormal heart rhythm, it shocks the heart into a normal rhythm with up to four to five pulses per event.
The implantable defibrillator is similar but slightly

S18

larger than the implantable pacemaker; it consists
of a power supply (that is, battery), energy storage
components and high-voltage devices for pulse generation, electrode leads for sensing and delivering
stimulus pulses, a telemetry inductive link channel to
program and individualize device behavior for each
patient, and sensing/processing circuits for monitoring heart signals, collecting therapy history and
diagnostic files, and monitoring all subsystem functions [28]. As in the case of the cardiac pacemaker,
low current consumption (typically ,10–20 mA) in
the implantable defibrillator is absolutely critical to
meet the battery lifetime requirements.

Visual Prosthesis
An emerging electronic biomedical implant aimed at
restoring vision loss due to degeneration of the light
sensing photoreceptors caused by incurable diseases
such as retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and age-related
macular degeneration (AMD) is reported in [29]. The
prosthetic device is inspired by early discoveries that
direct electrical stimulation of the retinal neurons creates visual sensation [30]. The overall system, as shown
in Figure 7, consists of an external signal processing
unit for complementary metal oxide semiconductor
(CMOS) camera output, a bidirectional telemetry unit,
an internal signal processing unit, a stimulus generator/driver, and an electrode array for interfacing to
the retina [31], [32]. The communication link has two
basic components—power and data transfer from the
external to the internal unit, and data transfer from the
internal to the external unit.
As in the case of most implants, an external class-E
driver is used as the power coil transmitter owing to
its high efficiency and ability to generate high field

250 mW to the implant unit over a coil distance of 0.7
to 1.5 cm, corresponding to a coupling coefficient of
0.17 to 0.08 [31]. A back telemetry link sends digital
data at 3.3 kbps from implant to external unit using
the load modulation technique. The inductive power
delivery system also features an adaptive controller to monitor coupling variations and changes in
implant current loading to deliver power as required
by the implant [33]. These variations can result in
increased implant heating due to excess transmitted
power, causing a detrimental effect on the tissue in
the long term; or decreased implant supply voltage/
current due to insufficient transmitted power, causing improper device operation or shutdown. Experi-

adaptive inductive link achieves a 2x improvement in
efficiency—from 357 mW with adaptive control compared to 763 mW without.

Brain Computer Interfaces
Neural interfaces convert brain signals into outputs
that infer brain intentional states. As a communication channel it can be used to replace lost function
such as voluntary arm or leg movement in patients
with severe motor disabilities. Invasive signal recording methods for BCIs include electrocorticography
(ECoG), electrical brain activity recorded beneath the
cranium, and single-unit activity (SUA) recordings to
monitor individual neuron action potential firing [35].

approach reported in [42] utilizes the Utah Electrode Array
(UEA), a 10 X 10 array of
platinum-tipped silicon extracellular electrodes. As shown
in Figure 8(b), the mixedsignal integrated circuit is
flip-chip bonded to the back
of the Utah Array to directly
connect to all 100 electrodes.

via an off-chip 5-mm gold-onpolyimide coil [42]. The 4.7 by
5.9 mm2 chip was fabricated
in a 0.5 mm 3M-2P CMOS process and consumes 13.5 mW.

modalities [35]–[38], several groups are implementing
hardware approaches for direct neural interfaces based
on SUA spike recordings as it provides high SNR, fine
spatial resolution and localized action potentials for
decoding very specific motor movements and/or cognitive tasks, with control signals of many degrees of
freedom [39]–[46].
Hardware implementations for modular neural
spike recording brain interfaces are presented in [22].
Lithographically defined probes in a standard silicon
CMOS process in [22] have been used to interface up
to 256 microelectrode recording sites with the amplifier
and processing circuits fabricated in the same substrate
as the electrodes. In [41], two 32-channel recording sites
are interfaced to on-chip amplification and processing electronics using parylene ribbon interconnects,
as shown in Figure 8(a). A 4–8 MHz inductive link is
used for power and forward telemetry to transfer data
toward the implant microsystem using phase-coherent
FSK. The reverse telemetry link utilizes a dedicated
OOK transmitter with its carrier frequency programmable from 70 to 200 MHz. Both links achieve reported
data rates of 2 Mb/s for a channel scan rate of 62.5 kS/s

Electronic Pill for
Medication Compliance

Ingestible devices, unlike
the chronically implanted
devices, reside within the body only for a limited time
to perform specific functions such as diagnosing of the
gastrointestinal (GI) tract or reporting of useful medical observations (that is, core body temperature). An
example application of new technology for ingestible
devices is a medication adherence tag that consists of
an electronic microchip and a biocompatible antenna
inlay attached onto the surface of a standard 00-sized
capsule with outer diameter of 8.53 mm and height or
locked length of 23.30 mm, as shown in Figure 9(a)
[47], [48]. Once this electronic pill (e-pill) is ingested,
an external body worn reader establishes a communication link between the capsule transponder inside
the GI tract and the reader. The e-pill transponder
utilizes an electronic burst (eBurst) communication
scheme to generate RF bursts larger than the incident
power at any given time. The operation of the tagging
system can be treated as a two-step energy conversion
process. During the charging phase, a low frequency
alternating signal from the external reader activates
the tag to support nominal device functionality and
establish the required charge on a storage capacitor to
sustain a short RF burst during the discharge phase. In

this phase, an active 915 MHz transmitter is enabled to
generate a short RF burst until the storage capacitor is
partially discharged, after which the tag re-enters the
charging phase [48]. By detecting if and when the capsule is ingested, a patient’s adherence to medications
can be measured in terms of percent of doses taken
over a period of time [49]. Another device developed
by Proteus Biomedical, utilizes ingestible event markers (IEMs) that are tiny, digestible sensors powered by
a food-like battery that is activated by stomach fluids
after swallowing [50]. Once activated, the pills send
signals to a receiver that is similar to a large bandage.
The receiver records the date and time of the ingestion
event. The IEM is the cornerstone of the company’s
Raisin System, which is currently under development.

Video Capsule Endoscopy
Wireless capsule endoscopy, also known as video capsule endoscopy (VCE), is likely the most prominent
ingestible in vivo electronic technology approved for
clinical practice. Although it was only introduced in
2000, VCE has become the gold standard for endoscopic
examination. The PillCam capsule, first introduced by
Given Imaging [51], is small enough to be swallowable,
typically measuring around 11 mm 3 26 mm, and is
battery powered. Images are captured as the capsule
passes through the GI tract and transmitted wirelessly using an onboard RF transceiver that operates in
the 402–405 MHz MICS band with a power output of
225 dBm. The technology has proven to be an effective
modality in diagnosing many small bowl diseases such
as obscure GI bleeding, Crohn’s disease, GI polyposis
syndromes, and small bowl tumors. The PillCam capsule [shown in Figure 9(b)] includes an optical dome
with a lens holder and a short focal length lens, four

light emitting diodes (LEDs), a CMOS image sensor,
two silver oxide batteries, and an ASIC RF transmitter
with an external receiving antenna [52]. The PillCam
transmits up to 14 images/s, or 2,600 images assuming
the capsule remains ~8 hrs in the small intestine and
15–20 minutes in the esophagus. A critical challenge for
this technology is to image the entire GI tract within the
capacity limits of the on-board batteries.

Conclusions
In vivo wireless biomedical devices hold the promise to become one of the major technology drivers of
the 21st century. With continued advances in electronic component integration, sensor development,
and micropackaging technologies, these biomedical
devices will achieve widespread use in a myriad of
emerging biomedical applications aimed at improving quality of life.

implant size, power dissipation and system functionality. Wireless powering of biomedical implants is primarily via low frequency inductively coupled links as
at low frequencies the RF heating due to tissue absorption is minimized. And while data telemetry between
extracorporeal and in vivo devices is typically implemented by modulating the amplitude or frequency of
the power carrier and/or changing the load impedance
of secondary coil, highly power efficient communication links are feasible by optimizing and separating the
power and data links. For optimum data link performance, the choice of operating frequency and antenna
design becomes critical. These basic design considerations have been shown in the context of in vivo biomedical systems such as implantable visual and neural
interfaces and ingestible capsule technologies.
