ecent advancements in wireless power
transmission (WPT) technologies are
enabling various engineering applications with potential product implementation. WPT can be utilized to
charge the batteries in the equipment without the
need for a wire connection. For systems that use
only very low power, we can get rid of the battery
altogether and run on energy harvested from ambient radio frequency (RF) and microwave radiation.
WPT can be carried out via radio waves or microwaves, using wireless communication technologies
and system design or by using resonant coupling
or inductive coupling techniques. The characteristics of WPT are summarized in Table 1. “Safety”
in Table 1 presents the field strength or other phenomena that should be considered for the protection of human beings and other living things. This
article describes the past, present, and future of
WPT, including the many prominent technologies

History of
Wireless Power Transmission
Figure 1 shows a brief historical review of WPT.
Maxwell’s equations, which were formulated in
1862, are essentially the first theoretical basis of
WPT [Figure 1(1)]. The concept of the Poynting vector describes the radio wave as an energy flow. After
Maxwell and Poynting, Nikola Tesla had a dream
over a hundred years ago that all electricity would
be provided wirelessly. He carried out the first WPT
experiments at the end of 19th century [1], [2] [Figure 1(2)]. He tried to transmit approximately 300 kW
power via 150 kHz radio wave. Unfortunately, he
failed because of diffusion of the wireless power,
which depends on the frequency of operation and
the size of the transmitting antenna. He used an
operating frequency of 150 kHz. After Tesla’s failure, the history of radio-wave development focused

After the 1980s, many experiments on
the MPT development were carried
out in Japan.

Goldstone Facility (Figure 3) [6]. The distance between
the 26 m diameter parabolic transmitting antenna
and the 3.4 3 7.2 m2 size rectennas array was 1.6 km.
The transmitted microwave power from the klystron
source was 450 kW at a frequency of 2.388 GHz, and
the achieved rectified dc power was 30 kW dc with
82.5% rectifying efficiency.
Although Brown succeeded in the WPT field experiments, the system size and cost was too big for any
realizable practical applications. Therefore, commercial MPT systems did not become part of our daily life.

required for the SPS, and consequently, MPT techniques have been developed with the development
of the SPS [8].
After the 1980s, many experiments on the MPT
development were carried out in Japan [Figure 1(7)].
Hiroshi Matsumoto of Kyoto University and his group
carried out MPT rocket experiments in 1983 (Figure
4). This included the microwave ionosphere nonlinear interaction experiment (MINIX) for the SPS. His
group carried out a several MPT field experiments [8],
which were based on new microwave technologies for
wireless communication and radar sensing. An MPT
experiment with a phased array was carried out in
1992 [9], [10], the first trial to apply the phased array
technique for this purpose. Kyoto University, Kobe
University, and their team flew a fuel-free airplane
powered only with 2.411 GHz microwave energy using
a phased array with 96 GaAs semiconductor amplifiers and 288 antennas in three subarrays (Figure 5). A
Canadian group also flew a fuel-free airplane in 1987.
They adopted a parabolic antenna system [11].
In the United States, some research groups maintained the MPT and SPS research through the 1980s.
Then in 1995, NASA launched a project to take a fresh
look at solar powered satellites. U.S. research in MPT
reenergized with this project [12].

MPT technologies were also developed with
a solar power satellite (SPS), as presented in [Figure 1(6)], and the approach was proposed by Peter
Glaser in 1968 [7]. The SPS overcame some of the
drawbacks of MPT, for example, the low overall
system efficiency, which depends on microwave/dc
conversion, and the large size of the antennas. The
SPS supplied approximately ten times more electric power than solar cells on the ground because
it was in geostationary orbit in space. There is no
night in the geostationary orbit, so power generation is 24/7, and the microwaves do not get absorbed
by the clouds and rain as sunlight does. MPT was

The phased array is an important feature in the
development of a practical MPT system. In Japan, two
MPT experiments with phased arrays were carried out
at the end of the 2000s. One was a field MPT experiment from an airship to ground with two phasedcontrolled magnetrons by Kyoto University’s group in
2009 (Figure 6) [13]. The first phase-controlled magnetron was developed by W. C. Brown in 1960s [14]. The
Kyoto University group revised the phase-controlled
magnetron in the 1990s [15] and applied it to an airship experiment. The other field experiment with a
phased array was carried out by a team from Kobe
University, Japan, and John Mankins, from Hawaii in
the United States in 2008. They transmitted approximately 20 W of microwave power towards a target 150
km away with a phased array. Even though they could
not receive the microwave power, which depended
on distance and antenna aperture, the transmission
scheme formed the basis for follow-on work.
In the 2000s, advances in microwave technologies
pushed WPT back into consideration for commercial
applications. With the development of mobile communications technologies, the required power decreases
for WPT [Figure 1(8)]. This means that we can receive
enough power via microwaves, just as with a wireless

In the 2000s, advances in microwave
technologies pushed WPT back

applications.
communication [Figure 1(9)]. This was termed “ubiquitous power source,” meaning that the source of the
microwave power is everywhere and always on with
WPT [16].
Wireless power can be received through broadcast
service radio waves also [Figure 1(9)]: Energy harvesting systems can be developed based on this approach
[17], [18]. The definition of “energy harvesting” or
“energy scavenging” is the process by which energy is
derived, captured, and stored from external sources,
for example, solar power, thermal energy, wind energy,
salinity gradients, kinetic energy, or broadcast radio
waves. One of the more famous energy harvesters is
the power microelectromechanical systems (MEMS),
which can generate electric power from the fluctuation in a MEMS semiconductor. The energy harvester
from broadcast radio waves is a rectenna, used for
both MPT and WPT.
The other recent trend in WPT started from the use
of resonant coupling by MIT [19] in 2006. The resonant
coupler is well known as a microwave filter [Figure
1(10) and (11)]. The team at Massachusetts Institute of
Technology (MIT) applied it to WPT. With this technique, a large amount of power (from watts to kilowatts) can be transmitted without any radiation over
mid-length distances (more than a few meters) at low
frequencies (less than 10 MHz) using simple resonant
circuits. It became evident that, the resonant coupling
of WPT is more suitable for commercial needs. The
IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium
(IMS) Workshop on Innovative Wireless Power Transmission: Technologies, Systems, and Applications
(IMSWIWPT2011) was held in May, 2011 [20], where

much new research on the resonant coupling WPT
was presented.

Key Technologies of Wireless Power
Transmission
Rectifying Circuit
As discussed above, there are two main approaches to
WPT. One is the resonant coupling approach, which
includes inductive coupling and the other is MPT. The
use of the rectenna as a rectifier is one common key
technology for both types of WPTs. The rectenna is
composed of an antenna, which receives microwave
power; a low-pass filter, which prevents higher harmonics from reaching the rectifier; and the rectifier,
with diode(s) and an output filter to rectify the received
microwave signal to dc. Rectifying circuit technology
is important for WPT, as some forms of rectifying circuits needs to be always used for radio waves to dc conversion in all types of WPT architectures.

Ideally, the conversion efficiency of the rectifying
circuit is 100%. In general, the rectenna structure is
consist of a single shunt full-wave rectifying circuit
with one diode, a l/4 distributed line, and a capacitor to reduce the loss in the diode. The rectenna can
theoretically rectify microwave signals with 100% efficiency with only one diode [21]. A theoretical approach
with a real diode was described by Yoo and Chang of
Texas A&M University [22].
There are many kinds of rectennas, as shown in.
Figure 7. Typical characteristics for actual high efficiency rectennas are shown in Figure 8, which shows
the efficiency of rectennas as a function of microwave
frequency. In 2011, Nihon Dengyo Kosaku Co., Ltd., of
Japan, developed a rectenna exhibiting over 90% efficiency in the 2.45 GHz band for a commercial product
[38]. This was the first commercial rectenna product
and is the highest efficiency rectenna in the 2.45 GHz
band as far as the author knows.
According to the rectifying theory, the efficiency
of the rectenna decreases with the decrease of microwave input power. This is caused by the characteristics of the diode and therefore, a special circuit needs
to be considered to increase the efficiency at lower
microwave input power levels for energy harvesting,
ubiquitous power source applications, as shown in
[16], [17], [39]–[42].

Antenna and Coupler Including
a Resonator
The other key technologies involve the design of the
resonator for the resonant coupling method, and the
design of an antenna for MPT as a power transmission
source.

Figure 9. Coupling transmission efficiency of the resonant
coupling circuit approach.
The efficiency of the resonant coupler was first
described in coupling theory [19], [43], specifically,
the well-known theory of the microwave bandpass
filter (BPF). It was shown that the theory can be
applied to both an electric resonant coupling circuit
and a magnetic resonant coupling circuit with coils.
A theoretical approach based on BPF theory was also
carried out [44].
Recently, for the resonant coupling circuit with coils,
a theoretical approach based mainly on inductive coupling has been carried out [45], [46]. From the theory
of inductive coupling, a figure of merit is kQ, in which
k is a coupling coefficient and Q is the quality factor
of the coil resonator, respectively. For simple inductive
coupling WPT, only k controls the efficiency. The factor k depends almost entirely on the distance between
the two coils. However, in resonant coupling WPT, we
can expand the distance when k is small but Q is large.
The maximum coupling transmission efficiency is calculated with the figure of merit shown in Figure 9.
On the contrary, a transmitting antenna and a
receiving antenna (the rectenna) are not coupled in the
MPT.
The beam efficiency is calculated by the Friis transmission equation and its expansion for calculation of
beam efficiency in the near field. The Friis transmission equation is applied at far field as follows;

We cannot use the Friis transmission equation to
calculate the received power in the near field because
the Friis transmission equation assumes a plane wave
in the far field, while spherical waves exist in the near

The beam efficiency in the far field and near field

to near 100% when t . 2.
An infinite array can theoretically receive 100% of
the transmitted radio wave [47], [48]. Itoh, et al., calculated the absorption efficiency of a rectenna array
with circular microstrip antennas [49]. They conclude
in the article that the absorption efficiency of the infinite rectenna array composed of circular microstrip
antennas is theoretically 100%. The absorption efficiency of the infinite rectenna array composed of
other types of antennas is formulated in other papers
[50], [51]. Otsuka, et al. expanded the theory of the
absorption efficiency of the infinite rectenna array to
that of the finite rectenna array and carried out a WPT
experiment to confirm the absorption efficiency of the
rectenna array [52]. The experimental results indicate
that the absorption efficiency of the rectenna array
can be close to 100%. Based on these studies, we can
consider that the beam efficiency can be almost 100%
with t . 2 in WPT systems.

Applications of Wireless Power Transmission
Wireless Power Transmission
for Electric Vehicles
One exciting application of WPT is wireless charging of an electric vehicle. We can apply various
WPT techniques including inductive coupling, resonant coupling, or MPT, for use in charging electric
vehicles.
Inductive coupling WPT has been applied to the
wireless charging of an electric bus by Hino Motors
[56], Ltd. and Showa Aircraft Industry [57]. They
called it ‘inductive power transfer’ and demonstrated
an inductive power transfer hybrid system, operating
over the period from April 13 to 27, 2009. In Korea,
a resonant coupling technique for a wireless power
supply has been used for an online electric vehicle
(OLEV) (Figure 12) [58]. Power from the 60 Hz supply
is converted to a frequency of 20 kHz by an inverter
stage. 60 kW of power may be transferred wirelessly
from power lines with 80% efficiency. Some companies in the world, for example, HaloIPT Co., Evatran
Co., and UniServices Co., showed the inductive coupling WPT system for an electric vehicle as commerFigure 11. New phased array for MPT with GaN FET and

[65] and used 13.56 MHz as the coupling frequency.
In Kyoto University, wireless charging for a mobile
phone via 2.45 GHz microwave link (Figure 15) has
been proposed [16]. The advantage of MPT based
wireless charging is that it can be a multiuser and
multipurpose system. We can transmit both power
and information via the microwave connection [66].

Wireless Power Transmission for
Other Applications
WPT can also be applied to various other applications
and systems. RF identification (RFID) is probably the
most well-known commercial application of MPT.
This technology mainly uses the 900 MHz band. As
already mentioned, energy harvesting from broadcast radio waves is one of the important technologies
for WPT. A team from Intel used channel 48, 674–
680 MHz, and harvested 60 mW, 0.7 V with a Yagi-Uda
antenna [17]. PowerCast Co. released an energy harvesting receiver for operation at 850–950 MHz, using
26 dBm and 211 dBm input power, respectively.
Kashima Co., Japanese building company, proposed a wireless building using microwave power
technology with Kyoto University [68]. They used the
building structure itself as a waveguide for the microwave power to reduce the number of electric wires.
Another Japanese building company, Takenaka Co.,
is developing a noncontact outlet with a resonant coupling technology. A German company, EnOcean has
released a codeless switch that uses an energy harvesting technology [69]. The codeless switch is composed
of an energy harvester from light, vibration, and other
sources, and an RF device to send on/off information
to the lights. This presents a kind of wireless building
since there is no wire between the switches and lights.

A batteryless sensor is another innovative WPT
application. Kyoto University’s team has driven

Summary
This article presents the history of WPT and the various technologies and applications of this exciting
technology. In the near future, standardization and
regulation will be of importance to realizing WPT
based products for commercial applications. The
WPC has defined a standard for inductive coupling
and members of this group have released conforming products. There are, as yet, no standards or regulation for resonant coupling and MPT technologies.
In Japan, a technical forum known as Broadband
Wireless Forum has been established to discuss the
future of WPT [71]. SPS researchers have also submitted a proposal for WPT to the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) [72]. In the IEEE MTT
Society, the Technical Committee MTT-26 Wireless
Energy Transfer and Conversion was established in
June, 2011 to discuss the future of WPT. Let us hope
that the WPT will bring us all a bright future.
