Abstract
Over the last few years arrays of evanescently coupled waveguides have been brought into
focus as a particular representation of functionalized optical materials, in which the dispersion
and diffraction of propagating light can be specifically tuned. Moreover, it turns out that the
light evolution in these systems shares fundamental similarities to the quantum evolution of
particle wavefunctions, so that waveguide arrays can act as a model system for emulating
quantum mechanics. Recently, a novel technique was developed with which waveguides can
be directly ‘written’ into various optical bulk materials using femtosecond laser pulses, which
allows for the realization of a variety of innovative concepts which are not feasible using other
fabrication methods. The aim of this tutorial is to give an introduction to this topic.
(Some figures in this article are in colour only in the electronic version)

the results can be applied to discrete systems in general.
Hence, the experimental demonstration of discrete phenomena
in waveguide arrays reveals the fundamental properties of
discreteness in general. Accordingly, in recent decades the
investigation of light propagation in waveguide lattices has
been a steadily growing field of interest. However, when
the field advanced, many of the observed phenomena became
rather ‘optical’, since they often had no direct analogue in
any other field of physics. This indicates that lattices of
evanescently coupled waveguides are not just a simple model
system for a comparative investigation of discreteness, but
constitute a unique discrete physical system on their own as
well [2]. After being limited for years to one-dimensional
(1D) configurations, the research in waveguide arrays grew
to new heights when two-dimensional (2D) lattices were
experimentally realized in 2003, using optical induction in
photorefractive crystals [3, 4]. This was the initial point
for extensive theoretical and experimental research also in
2D discrete optics since, naturally, in such structures more
complex phenomena can be generated (e.g. vortex solitons;
see [5] for an extended review).

Introduction
Discreteness is an important aspect in a variety of research
fields in modern physics. The atomistic structure of matter in
solid-state physics and the discrete nature of electromagnetic
phenomena in quantum mechanics are only two popular
examples for the fundamental role that discreteness plays
today. Yet many of the theoretical predictions obtained in
these fields of research are often hard to verify experimentally.
However, discrete phenomena of distinct origin, e.g. in
Bose–Einstein condensates (BECs) and electronic crystals,
are very often strongly related, since they can be described
as a coherent interaction of a number of discrete cells.
Such equivalent physical systems exhibiting similar structures
in the mathematical formalism provide the possibility of
verifying experimentally a variety of effects. Here, arrays
of evanescently coupled waveguides, featuring an inherent
breaking of the isotropy of space, are one of the most prominent
systems [1], since they allow for a direct visualization
of the evolution of the wavefunction. The structure of
the underlying mathematical apparatus suggests that due to
obvious symmetries in the governing equations, most of

However, the postulation of numerous discrete optical
concepts relying on boundaries and interfaces in finite 2D
lattices and lattices with specifically tailored properties (for a
summary of such effects see [5]) revealed strong limitations
of the available techniques with respect to the fabrication
of waveguide arrays with specifically tailored shapes and
functionalities in one and two dimensions. The experimental
demonstration of these new ideas requires a high degree of
freedom in the lattice topology and, furthermore, precise
control of the properties of every single waveguide, so that
highly defined evanescent coupling and in particular artificial
defects in the lattice can be realized. It became evident
that a new approach for the experimental realization of such
structures was required.
In 2004, waveguide arrays fabricated by the femtosecond
(fs) direct-writing method were demonstrated for the very first
time [6, 7]. This technique offers a versatile method for the
fabrication of waveguide arrays with distinct properties and
features. Since then, a variety of publications based on this
approach dealt with numerous aspects of physics, from purely
optical effects, quantum-optical analogues, integrated optical
telecommunication devices to solitons and related nonlinear
phenomena. In this tutorial, the underlying principles of
discrete light propagation in fs-laser-written waveguide arrays
are reviewed and recent achievements highlighted.

Discrete systems and arrays of evanescently coupled
waveguides

and the optical paraxial Helmholtz equation for the evolution
of the electrical field envelope E:

The two most prominent examples of discrete systems in
physics are without any doubt BEC in periodic optical
potentials and, of course, the atomic structure of solids with
their crystalline potential (figures 1(a) and (b)). Although
discreteness obviously manifests itself in very distinct forms,
the spirit of the underlying mechanisms of the dynamics is
similar in every representation. In an abstract picture, in
contrast to continuous systems, discrete systems consist of
finite-sized, so-called discrete basic elements which interact
with each other (figure 1(c)). The response of the discrete
system depends therefore on the specific type of excitation,
the individual properties of the basic elements and their
interaction. Every setting which belongs to the class of
systems exhibiting this specific characteristic may hence be
called ‘discrete’. As a consequence, it is feasible to project
phenomena, commonly associated with a particular discrete
system, to an apparently different system, where they are
possibly much easier accessible and observable. The results
may then be generalized to all discrete systems.
In recent years it turned out that weakly guiding and
evanescently coupled photonic waveguide structures provide
an excellent model system for the analysis of the characteristics
of discrete systems [1] (figure 1(d)). This becomes particularly
clear when one compares the Schr¨odinger equation describing
the dynamics of the wavefunction in a variety of quantummechanical settings:

The equivalence is evident when the correspondence between
the characteristic values is borne in mind: time t and distance
z, Planck’s constant h
¯ = h/2π and reduced wavelength
λ− = λ/2π , mass m and refractive index of the bulk n0 , and
potential V and refractive index change n = n0 − n(x, y, z).
Thereby the main advantage of optical systems is that the
evolution of the wave packet takes place in space (evolution
coordinate z) instead of time (evolution coordinate t). This
allows for a direct observation by monitoring the spatial light
propagation and prevents the need for resolving the very short
time scales typically involved in the evolution of the electron
probability wavefunction.
In a continuous medium, a light beam experiences
normal diffraction and always spreads during propagation
(figure 2(a)). This changes strongly when the index of
refraction is periodically modulated [8, 9] (figure 2(b)).
Most evident are the two strong side lobes, which confine
a strongly modulated intensity pattern. Light is attracted
by the increased index and stays during propagation in the
vicinity of these regions, which accordingly act as waveguides.
Along the transverse dimensions, the light is mainly found
at these distinct points, supporting the term ‘discrete’ for
this system. However, the evolving field is not entirely
localized in the individual guides but spans an extended area

with evanescent tails. Hence, the field in every guide is
perturbed by its neighbours, which causes an energy flow,
also known as evanescent coupling, from one waveguide to
adjacent guides (figure 2(c)). In contrast to continuous media,
where all three spatial dimensions are intrinsically equivalent,
there is a fundamental difference between the longitudinal
propagation direction z and the transverse directions x, y
in which the energy transport occurs only by evanescent
fields. This is why the characteristics of the field propagation
and the resulting intensity distributions in the array are so
fundamentally different in waveguide arrays compared to
homogeneous media. This phenomenon is most obvious in
the band structure, also known as the dispersion relation, of
waveguide arrays, which connects the transverse β x , β y and
longitudinal β z wavevector components for a fixed optical
frequency. In a homogeneous medium, assuming paraxiality,
the dispersion relation reads

In order to describe the light evolution in evanescently
coupled wave-guiding structures, one commonly employs the
principle of coupled modes, in which the transverse shape
of the modes in the individual guides is assumed to remain
constant, so that only the amplitudes evolve. Since the
interaction between the waveguides drops exponentially with
increasing spacing, only coupling to the nearest lattice sites
is taken into account. A separation of variables yields the
coupled mode equations for the amplitude ϕ m,n in the m, nth
waveguide [11]

and is shown for the 1D case in figure 3(a). However,
in a waveguide lattice, for some transverse wavevectors the
periodic refractive index acts as a Bragg grating. As a
consequence, the continuous band is deformed and breaks
at the critical angles, which define the Brillouin zones [10]
(shown for a 1D array in figure 3(b)). In figure 3(c) the
reduced band structure with the allowed propagation bands,
separated by photonic bandgaps, is shown. This feature
further emphasizes the close relation between different discrete
systems such as solids and waveguide arrays, both exhibiting
a band structure due to their intrinsic periodicity.

field components of the modes in adjacent guides. The
quantity en,m denotes the transverse field envelope in the

the dielectric constant. Note that the self-coupling c0,0 is
commonly removed by normalization (c0,0 ∼ 0). The coupling
coefficients denote the energy flow from one waveguide to its
neighbours. Due to energy conservation, one additionally
finds cμ,ν = c−μ,−ν . Equation (4) applies on the most general
case of a square lattice with diagonal coupling (figure 4(a));
hence, for less complex settings some of the cμ,ν vanish.

In order to get an intuitive picture of light propagation in
waveguide arrays, it is instructive to derive an expression for
the first propagation band, shown in figure 5(a). To this end,
we consider a planar (1D) array i∂z ϕm = −c(ϕm+1 + ϕm−1 ) and
substitute the plane wave solutions
ϕm = ϕ0 exp{i(βm md + βz z)}

with the (discrete) transverse wavevector β m in the transverse
coordinate md( = x), and the waveguide spacing d. This yields
the dispersion relation

connecting the transverse and longitudinal dynamics.
Obviously this relation is periodic, in contrast to equation (3)
for the homogeneous medium.
When an optical field
propagates over a distance z, each transverse component gains
a phase = β z (β m )z. The corresponding transverse shift of a
wave centred around β m is then x = ∂ /∂β m = (∂β z /∂β m )z.
Hence, the angle θ of propagation reads [8, 13]

It is important to note that the coupled mode approach
used to derive the basic equations of propagation is a
paraxial approximation and, furthermore, only valid in the first
propagation band. This approach, although intuitive, suffers
from a lack of generality. A more universal approach, in which
waveguide arrays are regarded as an example of a general
1D periodic optical structure, is the Floquet–Bloch analysis
[10, 12]. It directly predicts that the spectrum of the
propagation constants is divided into bands, separated by gaps,
in which propagating modes do not exist. However, in most
relevant cases the coupled mode approach is fully adequate,
describing all of the observed propagation effects.

As a consequence, discrete systems exhibit a periodic
anomalous refraction, which oscillates with increasing
transverse wavenumber components. This behaviour is in
strong contrast to homogeneous media, where the refraction is
steadily increasing with increasing input angle.
Diffraction is caused by different transverse wavenumbers
resulting in different propagation angles θ , yielding a spatial
dispersion of different plane wave components. Therefore, the
degree of diffraction can be determined by

writing technique is an excellent approach to fulfilling these
requirements.
When ultrashort laser pulses are tightly focused into
the bulk material, nonlinear absorption takes place leading
to optical breakdown and the formation of a micro plasma,
which induces a permanent change in the material’s molecular
structure. In the particular case of fused silica as the processed
material, the density is locally increased [14], yielding an
increase of the refractive index [15]. This phenomenon is
commonly explained by the fact that bulk fused silica consists
of molecular ring structures which are composed of several
SiO2 molecules each, which are partially broken by the fs
laser radiation (see figure 6(a)). Subsequent recombination
to smaller ring structures which are composed of less SiO2
molecules with a higher packing density yields to the observed
densification and, hence, to a local increase of the refractive
index. When the spherical aberrations caused by the sample
surface are small, the dimensions of these induced changes
are approximately given by the size of the focal region of the
writing objective and can be calculated using

Here w 0 is the FWHM (full width at half maximum) radius of
the focal spot and b is the Rayleigh length. M2 characterizes
the difference between a real laser beam and a diffractionlimited Gaussian beam, while NA is the numerical aperture.
By moving the sample transversely with respect to the beam a
continuous modification is obtained and a waveguide is created
[16]. Such a guide can be written along arbitrary paths since
the only limiting factor in the placement of the focus is the focal
length of the writing objective [17]. Furthermore, all structural
changes are permanent and stable after fabrication.
Writing waveguides is a very active field of research.
Main topics are thereby on using a variety of bulk media

(10)

which is shown in figure 5(c). Whereas in homogeneous
media diffraction is normal, in discrete waveguide lattices the
behaviour is completely different since diffraction is periodic
with positive and negative values. Accordingly, at specific
transverse wave components (e.g. β m d = π /2), diffraction
completely vanishes.

Femtoecond-laser-written waveguide arrays:
fabrication and characterization
For the detailed investigation of all aspects of discrete light
propagation, waveguide lattices have to meet a variety of
conditions. The coupling between the single lattice sites
has to be highly homogeneous to prevent statistical and
chaotic behaviour. Furthermore, the properties of every single
waveguide should be tuneable, which in particular allows
for the insertion of artificial defects. Moreover, a diversity
of topologies has to be realizable in order to investigate the
light evolution in one- and two-dimensional periodic lattices
as well as in non-periodic configurations such as waveguide
crossings and junctions. Additionally, the fabricated arrays
should be stable and permanent. It turns out that the fs laser

and on directly influencing the refractive index distribution of
individual guides by beam shaping, minimizing propagation
losses, detailed analysis of the multiple fabrication parameters,
and more. We refer the interested reader to recent reviews on
this topic and the references therein [18–21].
The waveguides used for the experiments presented in
this tutorial were usually fabricated by a Ti:Sapphire laser
system (RegA/Mira, Coherent Inc.) with a repetition rate
of 100 kHz at a laser wavelength of 800 nm. The beam
was typically focused into polished fused-silica samples by a
20× microscope objective with a numerical aperture of 0.45.
This relatively low focusing ensures that the created refractive
index change is almost independent of the writing depth
inside the material, so even large waveguide structures are
still homogeneous in the vertical dimension. A sketch of the
writing setup is shown in figure 6(b). The resulting refractive
index change (for a fixed polarization) can be obtained from
the near-field distributions of the waveguides by calculating
the inverse Helmholtz equation [22]
A(x, y)
,
(12)
n2 (x, y) = n2eff − λ− 2
A(x, y)
using the assumption neff = nbulk , where A(x, y) is the intensity
distribution of the fundamental mode at the output facet. A
typical near-field pattern of a waveguide and the corresponding
refractive index distribution obtained by using equation (12)
are shown in figure 6(c).
The guiding properties of the individual waveguides are
strongly dependent on the writing parameters. Within the
multi-dimensional parameter space, the pulse duration, pulse
energy and writing velocity are the key parameters influencing
the resulting refractive index distribution. The optimal
processing parameters with respect to the described setup are a
pulse duration of about 150 fs and a pulse energy of 0.3 μJ [23].
Keeping these parameters fixed, by only changing the writing
velocity v a specific tuning of the refractive index modulation
is achieved. It could be shown that for writing velocities of
about 500 μm < v writing < 1500 μm the waveguide losses,
measured by a cut-back method, are approximately constant
(see figure 7(a)). However, the refractive index modulation
decreases for increasing writing velocities due to the smaller
overlap between successive pulses, as shown in figure 7(b).

This can be used for the modification of the guided modes,
since for smaller refractive index changes the mode is less
well guided resulting in a larger evanescent field. According to
equation (5), this is directly related to the evanescent coupling
between two waveguides, which is determined by the overlap
of the evanescent fields of the waveguide modes allowing the
tuning of the coupling not only by the waveguide separation
but also by the writing velocity. This can be used for several
applications but in particular to specifically introduce defects
in a waveguide array with constant waveguide spacing.
As a particular feature, the light intensity distribution can
be directly monitored inside the samples using a fluorescence
microscopy technique [24, 25]. To this end a special type of
fused silica with a high content of OH was used (Suprasil 311).
During the writing process non-bridging oxygen hole centres
(NBOHCs) are generated due to breaking of the molecular
bonds. The NBOHCs have a broad absorption band around
2.0 eV [26] and exhibit an absorption maximum at 620 nm [27].
Hence, when launching red light from a HeNe laser at λ =
633 nm (corresponding to 1.95 eV) into the waveguides, these
colour centres are excited and the resulting fluorescence (at λ =
650 nm) can be directly observed. Since the colour centres
are formed exclusively inside the waveguides, this technique
yields a high signal-to-noise ratio. In contrast to fluorescent
polymers (see e.g. [28]), the bulk material causes almost no
background noise. The experimental setup is sketched in
figure 8(a). The laser beam is launched into the waveguide
array using a 10× microscope objective (NA = 0.25). The
fluorescence distribution representing the diffraction pattern is
imaged onto a CCD camera using a 5× objective (NA = 0.13).
Most of the scattered HeNe-laser light is blocked by a 650 nm
longpass filter which improves the image quality considerably.
The electronic noise of the camera is suppressed by averaging
over several (usually ten) images. The waveguide arrays have
a very high length-to-width aspect ratio with sample lengths of
up to 100 mm and lattice widths in the order of a few hundred
microns. To overcome the problem to visualize a lattice with
such a high length-to-width aspect ratio, while maintaining
a high spatial resolution, the camera is translated along the
sample and multiple images are recorded, scaled down to
20 pixels in the propagation direction and stitched together

yielding images with a resolution of 40 μm × 0.5 μm per
pixel. Additionally, the propagation losses in the samples are
removed by rescaling. For this purpose, the light propagation
in a single waveguide is monitored and the recorded intensity
is fitted with an exponentially decaying function, which is
used to normalize the fluorescence images. In figure 8(b),
a fluorescence microscope image of light propagation in a
waveguide array after a single waveguide excitation is shown.
Importantly, the dependence of the fluorescence intensity on
the intensity of the propagating light is approximately linear,
so that not only qualitative but also quantitative measurements
can be performed.

resolution. Thus, even fast dynamic processes can be
monitored in a static manner by applying available imaging
techniques. Employing a constant transverse electrical field

In the optical setting, the transverse force q (z) is equivalent
to a detuning of the local refractive index of the waveguides.
However, in order to realize proper conditions for the wave
packet evolution, these index modifications have to be very
precise which is intricate in the fabrication. Luckily, there
is a much more sophisticated way to impose transverse
gradients on the waveguide array, employing a curvature of
the individual waveguides [32]. Assuming the bending to be
much smaller than the waveguide spacing d, in the 1D case the
paraxial Helmholtz equation (2) converts into

Quantum-optical analogies
From the early days of quantum mechanics, the study of
the electronic probability wavefunction in periodic lattices
was of high interest for the scientific community. Particular
attention was thereby paid to the investigation to the timedependent evolution and the impact of external fields. It was
shown by Felix Bloch in 1928 [29] that a linear transverse
potential yields a periodic oscillation of the wavefunction.
However, it took almost 65 years to experimentally observe
such Bloch oscillations [30] by replacing the atomic lattice
with a semiconductor superlattice. The challenge was to
overcome the limit of a short electron coherence lifetime,
which is lower than the oscillation time scale [1] of 40 ps
˚ and an electric field

strength of 10 V m [31]. Hence, it seemed much more
feasible to search for an analogue and to use an artificial
lattice. It becomes apparent that the direct access to quantum
effects is very intricate in many cases, requiring model systems
in which the fundamental characteristics of the phenomenon
under investigation can be adequately analysed.
Due to the similarity of the Schr¨odinger equation (1) and
the paraxial Helmholtz equation (2), waveguide arrays provide
an exceptional model system since the wave dynamics are the
same in both systems. A main advantage is that in optics the
evolution takes place in space instead of time, so the temporal
evolution is mapped onto a spatial dimension (the propagation

an intuitive picture of the underlying physics. Let us assume a
plane wave travelling through the array. In a straight array the
plane wave does not change during propagation (figure 9(a)).
If the waveguides are slightly curved, the plane wave will still
propagate straight, being almost not affected by the bending

(figure 9(b)). However, the arc length which is passed by the
plane wave is now a function of the position of the individual
guides. In the particular example of figure 9(b), the passed arc
length of the outer left guide is larger than the arc length of the
outer right guide. This is most apparent in the corresponding
curvilinear coordinate system, where the waveguides appear
to be straight. Owing to the geometrical effect, the plane
waves seem to have travelled different distances, resulting
in different effective group velocities and, hence, a different
effective index of the individual guides. Therefore, employing
a curvature allows for the optical simulation of a constant
transverse electrical field (z). In the coupled mode regime,
equation (15) reduces to
i∂z ϕm + c(ϕm+1 + ϕm−1 ) = ωx¨ 0 mϕm

Hence, G(β x d) moves for α > 0 with a constant velocity
towards +β x d during the propagation, where the velocity is
given by α/λ− [35]. In this intuitive picture, G(β x d) follows
the refractive index gradient, employing a transverse force
in the +β x d-direction. As G(β x d) moves through the band
structure without changing its shape, the spatial transverse
profile of the beam remains in its shape as well. The transverse
group velocity given by the derivative of the band determines
the path of the beam propagation, which follows the band
structure.
Following the propagation from z = 0 to z = π /(2α)
corresponds to a motion in reciprocal space of G(β x d) from
β x d = 0 to β x d = π /2, as shown in figure 10(a). At this
point, the transverse group velocity reaches its maximum due
to the maximal absolute value of the first derivative ∂βz /∂βx
of the band structure (see figure 5(b)). Propagating further
to z = π /α, G(β x d) reaches bx d = π which is the edge
of the Brillouin zone, where the transverse group velocity
vanishes (∂βz /∂βx = 0). The occurring Bragg reflection
on the periodic structure changes the transverse momentum,
which corresponds to a transfer of G(β x d) to the other side of
the Brillouin zone β x d = −π (see figure 10(b)). Note that,
compared to the initial position, the beam experienced until
now a transverse shift (which is proportional to the coupling
coefficient c). Due to the symmetry of the band structure
the propagation from z = π /α to z = 2π /α is similar to the
first half period but with opposite sign of the transverse group
velocity (see figure 10(c)). Hence, at z = 2π /α the beam
reaches its initial position so the initial field distribution is
restored and the periodic process is complete.
A different kind of geometric Bloch oscillations occurs
for a narrow excitation, i.e. when only a single waveguide is
excited. In this case light can no longer distinguish between
left and right, since also the complex-conjugated wave packet
ϕm∗ is a solution of equation (17). Hence, the beam experiences
a symmetric breathing and periodic refocusing.
Optical Bloch oscillations were first observed in
waveguide lattices in 1999 by two groups [36, 37], by
implementing a real transverse refractive index gradient in
the lattice. The first experimental observation of Bloch
oscillations in curved lattices was reported in 2004 [38],
whereas Bloch oscillations in fs-laser-written waveguide

for the amplitude ϕ m in the mth waveguide, with ω = n0 d/λ−
as a normalized frequency. The term ωx¨ 0 m represents the
transverse electrical field and can be tuned by an appropriate
curvature of the waveguide array.
Optical Bloch oscillations
When the transverse field does not change with time, Felix
Bloch showed that the evolving wavefunction exhibits an
oscillatory motion in the lattice [29]. The optical analogue
in a waveguide array would then require a parabolic curvature
x0 ∼ z2 of the array such that x¨ 0 = const. The corresponding
coupled mode equations then read [34]
i∂z ϕm + αmϕm + c(ϕm+1 + ϕm−1 ) = 0,

(17)

where a constant transverse refractive index gradient αm with
α = ωx¨ 0 = const is employed. In order to understand the
dynamics of optical Bloch oscillations, it is instructive to
begin with the evolution of a broad excitation with a Gaussian
envelope and a flat phase. The respective Fourier transform
G(β x d) is a narrow distribution and initially located around
β x d = 0. The evolution of this wave packet is depicted
in figure 10 in reciprocal space (upper row) and real space
(lower row). At the beginning of the Bloch cycle one obtains
a vanishing transverse group velocity, which arises from the
vanishing derivative of the band structure at β x d = 0. However,
the famous acceleration theorem [29] states that a constant
gradient in real space yields a constant motion in Fourier space.

and is illustrated in figures 12(c) and (d), where figure 12(c)
corresponds to the homogeneous lattice (σ = 0), whereas in
figure 12(d) the detuning is set to σ = c/2. As predicted, the
band splits into two minibands separated by a gap with a size
∼σ . Note that in the homogeneous array the Brillouin zone
π (instead of −π /2
βx d
π /2 in the
is −π
βx d
binary array), so for σ = 0 indeed equation (19) is equivalent
to equation (7) and the two bands in figure 12(c) appear only
due to the choice of the wrong limits.
As already described in the section about Bloch
oscillations, the transverse gradient is employed by bending
the waveguide array. When exciting the lattice with a
broad Gaussian beam with a flat phase, the resulting initial
narrow spectral distribution G(β x d) is centred around β x d = 0
(figure 13(a)). Due to the acceleration theorem, G(β x d) moves
towards the band edge β x d = π /2 during the propagation.
There, the presence of the minigap causes the wave to split
into two parts. One part tunnels through the minigap (Zenerlike tunnelling) to β x d = −π /2 in the lower band, while the
other part is Bragg reflected into the initial, upper miniband
to β x d = −π /2 (figure 13(b)). Propagating further results
in a motion of G(β x d) from β x d = −π /2 to the opposite
band edge at β x d = +π /2 in both minibands (figure 13(c)).
Again, tunnelling and Bragg reflection occur; however, at this
point the dynamics is much more complex due to the coherent
combination of tunnelling and Bragg reflection. Since the

Optical Bloch–Zener dynamics
In recent experimental studies it was confirmed that Bloch
oscillations come along with tunnelling to higher order bands
[41], which is known as the Zener tunnelling [42]. But
this process strongly dampens the Bloch oscillations and,
more importantly, the larger width of higher propagation
bands impeded the investigation of the interplay between
Bloch oscillations and Zener tunnelling. However, using
binary waveguide arrays this issue can be overcome. In
these structures the individual bands split into minibands and
interband tunnelling becomes possible. The benefit is that
the Bloch oscillations are not damped which significantly
simplifies the observation of Bloch–Zener dynamics [35].
The binary lattice has a unit cell, which contains two
dissimilar sites. The corresponding potential consists of
alternating deep and shallow wells (figure 12(a)), which arise
from the two different sites. As the lattice period now is twice
the one of the homogeneous array, the first band splits into
two minibands separated by a minigap, which is determined
by the different depths of the wells. In optics the corresponding
potential is achieved by waveguides with alternating high and
low refractive indices (figure 12(b)), which are expressed in

lower miniband is now occupied, the Bragg reflected part of
the wave packet in the upper band (from β x d = π /2 to β x d =
−π /2) interferes with the fraction that tunnels from the lower
band (β x d = π /2) to the upper band (β x d = −π /2), as shown
in figure 13(d).
Bloch–Zener dynamics for three different situations are
shown in figure 14, where in the upper row the experimental
data [40] and in the lower row the simulations (equation
(18)) are shown. The geometric parameters of d = 11 μm
and a radius of curvature R = 1.90 m yield an oscillations
period of 75 mm, corresponding to the sample length.
Figure 14(a) depicts the Bloch oscillations in a homogeneous
array. In this case the gap between the bands vanishes, the
Zener tunnelling rate is 100% and, hence, the excited upper
band is fully occupied at the beginning and at the end of the
sample, whereas the lower band has its maximum occupation
at the sample’s centre. In figure 14(b), the array is detuned
with σ = 0.22 c, corresponding to a tunnelling rate of 65%,
which was achieved by lowering the writing velocity from
120 mm min−1 to 96 mm min−1 in every second waveguide.

As the size of the tunnelling regions is given by the width
of G(β x d), a sufficiently broad beam experiences rapid
tunnelling. One can clearly see how the beam spatially breaks
up into two parts at the edge of the Brillouin zone, and then
follows different paths due to the opposite curvature of the
upper and the lower miniband. Further propagation results
in refocusing of the light field at the edges of the Brillouin
zone. Notably, the Zener tunnelling is much more complex
at the second and later tunnelling points since light occupies
both minibands and coherent interference determines the band
occupancy after the crossings. Increasing the gap between the
bands further to σ = 0.41 c by reducing the writing velocity
to 88 mm min−1 in every second waveguide decreases the
tunnelling rate to ∼25%. Under these conditions, the initially
excited band remains mostly occupied for the first Bloch period
and only a small fraction of the light tunnels into the second
miniband (figure 14(c)), effectively doubling the oscillation
frequency compared to figure 14(a).

Dynamic localization

In contrast to Bloch oscillations, which occur in a constant
linear transverse potential, it was predicted in 1986 that a
transverse electric field, which is periodic in time (ac field),
yields periodic collapse of the evolving wavefunction, which
is well known as dynamic localization (DL) [43]. Although
this periodic recovery is, at a first glance, very similar to
Bloch oscillations, DL is based on fundamentally different
mechanisms. Whereas for a constant transverse field the
eigenvalues of the system are equally distributed [29, 34]
yielding a periodic recovery of the initial field distribution,
for a periodic ac field, the entire band collapses, preventing
the wave packet from spreading over the lattice. However,
the observation is difficult in most quantum systems as the
required field strengths are too high. To overcome these
limits, complex semiconductor superlattices with larger lattice
periods have been used [30, 44, 45], although definitive
evidence was still lacking [46]. Again, photonic structures
provide the possibility of simulating such external potentials
in curved waveguide arrays as well as of resolving the evolution
dynamics [33, 47, 48].
In the optical analogue, the transverse ac field can be
mimicked by a periodic bending of the waveguides

d and a wavelength λ, DL is obtained only for the particular
ratios A0 /z0 and the wave packet collapses at z0 . This is in
strong contrast to Bloch oscillations, which are obtained for
every transverse constant field.

Polychromatic dynamic localization
Integrated optical devices based on self-imaging provide
a variety of attractive applications, including image
transmission, optical collimation or even reshaping of
ultrashort laser pulses [51–53]. Image reconstruction, first
considered in slab waveguides [54], was for example shown in
homogeneous waveguide arrays due to the discrete analogue
of the Talbot effect, yielding periodic self-imaging for
certain initial field distributions [55]. More general types
of periodic input recovery can be realized by using optical
BO or optical DL in properly engineered lattices. The main
drawback of these mechanisms is the rather small bandwidth
of operation. In the case of DL, the destruction of self-imaging
for broadband beams stems from the resonant nature of
equation (23), whereas for BO the self-imaging period turns
out to be proportional to the wavelength λ. However, in order
to render waveguide arrays interesting for applications, an
increase in the bandwidth is highly desirable in order to achieve
broadband operation.
Here, we present a generalized DL, in which the stringent
resonant condition (23) is softened in order to achieve an
approximated DL over an extremely broad spectral region.
The basic idea relies on the fact that equation (23) has infinite
solutions as sketched in figure 18(a) [56]. However, in the
vicinity of the resonances at ηj the sign of the effective
coupling alternates. For example, for the design wavelength
λ = 550 nm at the first two resonances one finds ceff (λ1 −
ε) < 0 and ceff (λ2 − ε) > 0, as shown in figure 18(b) (note
the optical frequency ω, i.e. 1/λ is plotted). A combination
of both resonances would therefore yield a strongly reduced
effective coupling, which effectively vanishes over a broad
spectral region (see the red curve in figure 18(b)). Therefore,
a sample was fabricated which exhibits a bending consisting
of two segments where the first segment meets condition (23)
for η1 = 2.405 (first-order DL) and the second one for η2 =
5.520 (second-order DL). The resulting profile is sketched in
figure 18(c). For a waveguide spacing of d = 26 μm and a
design wavelength of λ = 550 nm, following the analysis in
[56] yields for the first section A1 = 56 μm and z1 = 63 mm,
and for the second section A2 = 86 μm and z2 = 42 mm.
The experiments demonstrate that with such a device DL is
achieved over the entire visible spectral region from 450 nm
to 700 nm. Figure 18(d) shows the propagation in the
sample at λ = 633 nm, whereas in figure 18(e) the spectrally
resolved output pattern is shown [57]. In comparison, in
figure 18(f) the spectrally resolved output pattern for the
straight lattice is shown, exhibiting strong diffraction for all
spectral components.
Notably, polychromatic DL, together with recently
proposed polychromatic Bloch oscillations [58], opens up
new avenues for applications in various physical contexts.
In particular, these results suggest new approaches for
flexible shaping of polychromatic light with ultrabroadband
or supercontinuum spectra, which can be enhanced further
through the introduction of structure tunability and optical
nonlinearities.

Figure 16. Setup for observing a spectrally resolved output pattern.
An optical supercontinuum is generated by the propagation of an
ultrashort pulse through a highly nonlinear fiber (PCF). The white
light is spectrally and spatially resolved after propagation through
the waveguide array using a prism for dispersion and projection onto
a CCD camera. Figures from [25].

follows from equation (23) for a wavelength of λ = 633 nm.
Initially, a single waveguide is excited. After a propagation
distance of 12.5 mm the light field spreads across about nine
waveguides before it starts to relocalize in order to collapse
after 25 mm. However, DL is only exact for coupling restricted
to the immediate neighbours. Since the investigated systems
feature slight higher-order coupling to sites beyond direct
neighbours with a relative strength of 3% and also contain
small imperfections inside the array, no perfect refocusing
of the excitation is obtained. This is even more pronounced
after two periods, where imperfections and coupling effects
have accumulated. It is important to understand that in
most cases the impact of next-nearest neighbour coupling can
be safely neglected since the deviations from pure nearestneighbour coupling is only marginal; however, when this
first order is suppressed as for DL, any higher-order coupling
becomes visible. A discussion of higher-order coupling can
be found in [49], whereas an experimental analysis is reported
in [50].
The resonant behaviour of DL can also be analysed with
respect to the excitation wavelength. For this purpose an
optical supercontinuum is generated by injecting fs pulses
into a highly nonlinear fibre, resulting in spectral broadening
up to an almost octave spanning spectrum in the visible
range. A camera records the near-field output pattern after
dispersive splitting induced by a prism, as shown in figure 16.
Figure 17 illustrates the self-imaging property in the output
spectrum for two samples designed for different wavelengths.
The waveguide spacing is fixed to d = 16 μm and the
bending period of 25 mm is equal to the sample length. The
respective curving amplitudes are A0 = 36 μm for λ = 543 nm
(figure 17(a)) and A0 = 42 μm for λ = 633 nm (figure 17(b)).
In both images it is clearly shown that DL occurs for the
design wavelengths solely, whereas for other wavelengths
in the vicinity of the design wavelengths the localization is
incomplete.

Self-imaging in waveguide arrays by segmentation
The self-imaging methods presented so far rely on
boundary-free propagation; truncated array structures lead
to considerable distortions of the self-imaging effect. This
can be overcome by a particular modification of the coupling
constants [59]; however, the extreme precision required does
not seem viable with current fabrication techniques.
Recently, it was suggested that introducing specific phase
shifts to the propagating modes by a segmentation of the
waveguide arrays can yield image reconstruction for arbitrary
1D and 2D intensity distributions even in finite configurations
involving boundary reflections [60]. In order to explain the
idea, first a finite planar (1D) array i∂z ϕm = −c(ϕm+1 + ϕm−1 )
is considered with waveguides m = 1, . . . ,M. One can show
[55] that this equation is fulfilled by a set of M propagation

of the kth supermode (k = 1, . . . , M). One can easily show
that introducing a phase shift of π in every second waveguide
results in a pairwise conversion of the individual supermodes,
1
as shown exemplarily in figure 20(a) for the mode am
, which

is transformed into am
. Importantly, different supermodes
exhibit different propagation constants (equation (25)). Hence,
assuming a sample of length L and introducing the phase
shift at position L/2, the diffraction occurring in the region
z < L/2 is reversed in the region z > L/2, so the initial
intensity distribution |ϕ(0)|2 is imaged on the output facet
|ϕ(0)|2 = |ϕ(z)|2 . This is schematically shown in figure 20(b).
A genuine way of impressing such a phase shift on the
propagating modes is the alternating segmentation of the
waveguides, so the accumulated additional phase shift in the

for perfect imaging at λ = 633 nm. For a segmentation period
of = 26 μm the required length of the segmented region
is s = 2.6 mm, according to the fabrication parameters used
for these waveguides (for a sketch of the 1D configuration
see figure 21(a)). The respective micrograph of the segmented
region is shown in figure 21(b). In the unsegmented array, light
at a wavelength of λ = 633 nm experiences strong diffraction
and spreads across the array, as shown in the fluorescence
images (figures 22(a) and (b)) for central and edge waveguide
excitations. However, this behaviour is significantly altered
by the segmentation. As soon as the light encounters the
phase shift, diffraction reverses and the initial light distribution
is restored. This effect is independent of the presence of
array boundaries, as can be observed for central as well
as edge excitation (see figures 22(c) and (d)). Obviously,
the segmented region is sufficiently small compared to the
coupling length lc = π /2c ≈ 15 mm to satisfy the condition of
an abrupt phase shift with reasonable accuracy, as is confirmed
by the agreement with the respective simulations (figures 22(e)
and (f)). As more complex intensity distributions are simply a
superposition of a set of single waveguide excitations, this
setting therefore allows for the imaging of arbitrary input
signals. The resolution of the image is only restricted by
the number of waveguides in the array.
The concept of phase shift-induced image reconstruction
can be extended to the 2D square lattice, since it can be
described by the superposition of horizontal and vertical
1D lattices as long as the impact of coupling between
waveguides along the diagonal is negligible. A sketch of

1D array and a 2D array, respectively.
Using the fs laser writing technique, a segmentation can

have revealed that this imaging method is also applicable to
large bandwidth signals and accordingly for short pulses as
well.

Nonlinear discrete optics
Many physical systems that behave linearly for small input
powers become nonlinear as the input power increases.
However, nonlinearity is often ignored in the analysis of
many systems due to unwanted complexity. Unfortunately,
the principle of superposition breaks, i.e. the independent
propagation of the individual optical fields. This is the
reason why a linear dependence is assumed as often as
possible to describe physical systems. Nevertheless, nonlinear
phenomena reveal various new and interesting aspects of
physics. Many of the developments of today’s networked
world rely on nonlinearity such as the high-speed optical

voice and data networks, optical storage for consumer devices
and computers along with a whole array of medical and
biotechnological advances.
The study of discrete nonlinear phenomena goes back to
1939, when plastic deformations of crystals were investigated
in detail [62]. However, it took almost 40 years before
the concept of a discrete spatial soliton was introduced for
the description of nonlinear energy localization in protein
molecules [63]. Then, in 1982, an analytical solution
of two nonlinear coupled harmonic oscillators was found
[64], describing a system of two evanescently coupled
nonlinear waveguides. The first relation between nonlinear
localization and arrays of evanescently coupled waveguides
was established in 1988, when it was predicted that in
one-dimensional lattices light can be trapped in only a few
waveguides by the influence of a χ (3) nonlinearity [65]. Hence,
for a sufficiently high input power the linear diffraction of the
light can be counterbalanced by the nonlinearity, so-called
discrete spatial solitons can exist in waveguide lattices, which
was experimentally verified in planar ridge waveguide arrays
etched into an AlGaAs substrate [66]. Since waveguide
arrays, where the discrete nature of the system breaks the
spatial symmetry, support a variety of nonlinear states which
are unstable and cannot be observed in continuous media,
these systems provide not only the basis for new fundamental
research but also for various innovative applications such as
all-optical routing, switching and storage devices [5, 67].

quantity n2(eff) is a function of the χ (3) nonlinearity and known
as effective nonlinear refractive index, whereas Aeff is the
effective area of the guided mode in the individual waveguides
and can be approximated by Aeff ≈ π r2 with r as the 1/e2 width of the mode. For increasing writing velocities during
the fabrication process the refractive index change becomes
smaller (see figure 7(b)) causing a weaker guiding and, hence,
a weaker confinement which results in an increase of r. For
an excitation wavelength of λ = 800 nm this is depicted in
figure 24(a). However, since during the writing process the
molecular structure of the bulk material is modified, also the
nonlinear refractive index is a function of the writing velocity,
as summarized in figure 24(b). Interestingly, while for high
writing speeds the nonlinearity is almost not affected and
reaches the value for the unprocessed bulk material (n2(bulk)
= 2.7 × 10−20 m2 W−1 at λ = 800 nm [68]), with decreasing
velocity also the effective nonlinear refractive index drops
to only n2(eff) = 0.25n2(bulk) [23, 69]. Thus, the effective
nonlinearity can be specifically tuned in order to tailor the
nonlinear propagation properties.
1D discrete solitons
Although the formation of a one-dimensional discrete soliton
seems to be similar to a nonlinear Kerr lens, which focuses
the travelling high-intensity beam [70, 71], the underlying
mechanisms differ. The additional phase shift induced by
the nonlinear term γ |ϕ m |2 ϕ m in equation (27) moves the
propagation constant of the excited guide into the semi-infinite
gap above the first band as shown in figure 25(a). Hence,
this guide cannot ‘communicate’ with the rest of the array,
so it forms an isolated state and the light remains ‘trapped’.
The width of the band in the 1D case can be obtained from
equation (7) to β z = βz(max) − βz(min) = 2c. Since
the nonlinear contribution to the propagation constant is
δβz(nonl) = γ |ϕm |2 according to equation (27), the critical
power for soliton formation can be roughly estimated by
|ϕm |2crit = 2c/γ . It is important to note that in fused silica
γ is positive; therefore, the nonlinear contribution is also
positive. In some materials, under particular conditions, γ may

be negative, so the propagation constant can be decreased until
it reaches the finite gap between the first and the second band,
resulting in the formation of discrete gap solitons [72].
When writing the waveguides into fused-silica samples,
the electronic χ (3) nonlinearity provides an almost
instantaneous response of the system, but is rather weak.
Therefore, a high input peak power is required for the
excitation of discrete solitons in these lattices, so that the
experimental analysis relies on powerful laser sources. Hence,
for the demonstration of the nonlinear discrete self-focusing a
pulsed fs laser beam may be used, which provides the required
peak power. In our experiments, we used a Ti:sapphire laser
system (Spitfire, Spectra-Physics) with a pulse duration of
about 150 fs, a repetition rate of 1 kHz and pulse energies
of up to 3 μJ at 800 nm. The light was coupled into the
centre waveguide with a 4× microscope objective (NA =
0.10), coupled out by a 10× objective (NA = 0.25) and
projected onto a CCD camera. The relatively low focusing
of the incoupling objective ensured that pulses with a higher
peak power could be launched into the array before the
damage threshold of the sample was reached. The power
of the beam was measured before the incoupling and after
the outcoupling objective using a beam splitter. Using this
setup, the power coupled into the waveguides was calculated
considering Fresnel losses, damping and the overlap integral
of the focal spot of the incoupling microscope objective and
the shape of the propagating mode in every waveguide. For
the first demonstration of a 1D discrete soliton in a fs-written
array, a planar 74.5 mm long sample consisting of nine
waveguides with a separation of 48 μm was fabricated at a
writing velocity of 500 μm s−1 . A microscope image of the
sample is shown in figure 25(b). The experimental difficulties
arise from balancing linear coupling which is desirably
strong, input peak power which is high enough to achieve
localization without breaking the sample and a propagation
length which allows considerable diffraction without having
the intrinsic waveguide losses (approximately 0.4 dB cm−1
in our experiments) to overcome the nonlinear propagation.
Even such low losses accumulate to significant values after
some centimetres of propagation. The maximum peak power
of the incoupled pulses is limited by the damage threshold
of the sample. Therefore, the waveguides are buried 0.5 mm
away from the incoupling facet, since the sample surface has
a significantly lower damage threshold than the bulk material.
This reduces the applied fluence at the sample surface and

allows to couple pulses at a substantially higher peak power
into the waveguides. The measured intensity distribution at
the sample output is depicted for three different peak powers
launched into the central guide in figure 26(a)–(c). Whereas
in the lower peak power range almost all of the guided energy
is coupled to the adjacent waveguides due to linear coupling,
at Ppeak = 500 kW input peak power the pattern already shows
some light which is trapped in the excited guide. Eventually,
at a peak power of Ppeak = 1000 kW the output intensity
pattern is almost completely localized [73]. It is important
to note that there is always some linear background in the
non-excited guides and localization will never be perfect due
to the excitation with pulsed light. Whereas the high power
is sufficient for localization in the central part of the pulse,
the pulse wings still experience linear diffraction due to their
significantly lower power. A comparison of the experimental
data with simulation is shown in figure 27, which still exhibits
an excellent agreement in the dependence of the amplitudes
in the individual waveguides. Clearly, the collapse of the
diffraction is seen when the propagation constant of the excited
guide leaves the band and moves into the gap. It is important
to note that for the numerical modelling a reduced nonlinear
coefficient γ using n2(eff) = 0.25n2(bulk) was used, which is
consistent with figure 24(b) since the array was fabricated
with a writing velocity of 500 μm s−1 .

One can clearly see that the nonlinear propagation in
waveguide lattices is much more complex than simple Kerr
lensing when one analyses the nonlinear light propagation
in periodically curved lattices. As described in the previous
section, a bending which fulfils equation (23) results in DL, i.e.
the localization of light after each full bending period, in the
low-power regime. However, increasing the input peak power
affects the sensitive phase relation between the adjacent guides
due to the induced nonlinear change of the refractive index in
the guides, resulting in delocalization of the output pattern,
although the nonlinearity is focusing. This phenomenon is
known as nonlinear diffusion [74]. In this setting, solitons
form only for much higher peak power compared to their
counterparts in straight lattices due to the altered phase relation
between adjacent guides which is caused by the bending. In
figure 28, the experimental verification of this phenomenon
is demonstrated [75]. In figure 28(a), the evolution of the
output pattern as a function of the input peak power is shown
for a 105 mm long sample with a waveguide spacing of
d = 34 μm. The localization period was chosen to be equal
to the sample length (i.e. z0 = 105 mm) and the required
bending amplitude was A = 104 μm. For Ppeak = 70 kW
launched into a single waveguide light dynamically localizes

in the excited channel at the output facet. When the peak
power is increased to Ppeak = 1030 kW, the light spreads
significantly since the phase relation between adjacent guides
is changed so that DL is no longer observed. Importantly,
the output pattern is asymmetric according to the asymmetric
sample (compare figure 15). Eventually, at Ppeak = 3450 kW
the nonlinear focusing overcomes the spreading and a discrete
soliton forms. However, the required power for soliton
formation is much higher than in the straight lattice, where
localization takes place already at Ppeak = 1200 kW (see
figure 28(b) for a straight sample exhibiting the same
parameters as in figure 28(a), except A = 0 μm).
2D discrete solitons
It was demonstrated by Kelley [76] that 2D solitons in
homogeneous media are unstable, i.e. they exist only at the
critical power. For lower power, the beam still spreads, and for
higher power the beam collapses. However, one can show that
the shallow refractive index variations of a waveguide array
support the stability of 2D solitons [3]. Hence, 2D discrete
solitons exhibit unusual features, with no counterpart in the
continuous regime [5]. The first experimental observation of

a discrete 2D soliton was accomplished in lattices optically
induced in a photorefractive crystal [77]. This induction
technique is today the most common method in the realization
of 2D waveguide lattices [78]. However, in contrast the
alternative approach based on the fs direct writing technique
has some inherent advantages, including e.g. the insertion of
artificial defects, the creation of anisotropic coupling, and
the realization of boundaries and interfaces between different
array topologies.
In the experiments for the observation of 2D solitons in
fs-written waveguide arrays presented here, a square 7 × 7
lattice (m,n = 1, . . . ,7) was used with a sample length of
105 mm and a waveguide separation of 40 μm. The writing
velocity was chosen to be 1250 μm s−1 . In order to avoid
damage of the device when exciting with high-power laser
pulses, the waveguides are buried 0.5 mm away from the
incoupling facet as discussed above. The change in the discrete
output pattern with increasing peak power is demonstrated in
figure 29. In figure 29(a) the output pattern in the linear
case at Ppeak = 40 kW is shown. The linear coupling is only
marginally influenced by the anisotropy (ellipticity) of the
waveguides, since the waveguide separations are large, so the
coupling is only weakly anisotropic. At Ppeak = 1400 kW (see
figure 29(b)) the linear coupling is reduced and at Ppeak =
2000 kW (figure 29(c)), almost all of the guided energy
remains in the excited waveguide: a 2D discrete soliton has
been generated [79]. It is evident that the power required
for soliton formation in a 2D lattice is usually considerably
higher compared to the 1D case (for the same fabrication
parameters). The explanation is simple: according to
figure 25(a), the propagation constant of the excited waveguide
has to be shifted out of the band in order to form a
nonlinear isolated state. One can easily verify that the twodimensional version of the dispersion relation equation (7) has
a significantly larger width (see e.g. figures 31(b), (c)) than the
1D case (compare figure 25(a)), so a higher power is required
to leave the band and move into the gap.

stationary excitations, which are called surface waves. These
are encountered in various areas of physics including solidstate physics, near-surface optics, plasmas and acoustics
[80–83]. In nonlinear optics, surface waves residing at the
interface between naturally uniform materials typically are
observed when their power exceeds a certain threshold and
are stable under appropriate conditions [84]. However, the
progress in their experimental observation was severely limited
because of unrealistically high power levels required for a
surface wave excitation at the interfaces of natural materials.
Interestingly, it turned out that the relatively shallow refractive
index modulation in waveguide arrays facilitates the formation
of nonlinear optical surface waves significantly and they can
be observed already at moderate power levels at the edge of
semi-infinite arrays in the 1D [85, 86] as well as in the twodimensional case [87–89].
The formation of discrete surface solitons is subject to
somewhat different physical factors than for discrete solitons
without any boundary interaction. Propagation bands and
bandgaps are a direct consequence of the periodicity of an
infinite waveguide array, yielding the existence of discrete
solitons when the propagation constant of the travelling modes
is shifted by the nonlinear influence from the bands into the
bandgaps. The required periodicity is also approximately
satisfied in a finite lattice, when the influence of the boundary
on the propagation of the mode can be neglected. The situation
completely changes in the presence of a surface, since the
periodicity is abruptly interrupted. The former homogeneous
band structure is splitting up depending on the distance to the
surface, so the simplified picture of shifting the propagation
constant from the band into the bandgap is no longer valid.
For the experiments shown here the same sample as for
the 2D discrete soliton in the bulk of the array was used.
The power-dependent transformation from linear diffraction
to the discrete soliton is shown in figure 30 for the surface
(left column) and the corner case (right column). At low input
peak power Ppeak = 40 kW the pattern broadens due to discrete
diffraction, and all of the power in the excited waveguides has
been coupled into the adjacent ones, as shown in figure 30(a).
Increasing the power to Ppeak = 1800 kW a slightly localized
intermediate state is observed (figure 30(b)). Eventually, at
Ppeak = 4800 kW the light is almost completely ‘trapped’
in the form of a discrete soliton in the excited waveguide,

2D discrete solitons at surfaces and interfaces
The presence of an interface between materials with different
physical properties can profoundly affect the evolution of
nonlinear excitations.
Such interfaces support specific

the surface is considerably higher than in the bulk of the array.
This is due to the repulsive character of the array surface [90],
which the nonlinearity has to overcome in addition. The high
accuracy of the writing process results in waveguide arrays
which exhibit sharply defined boundaries. This ensures the
absence of scattering or noticeable statistical distortions of the
output pattern caused by small waveguide displacements or
inhomogeneities and proves that the fs laser writing technique
is ideally suited for studying surface phenomena.
Nonlinear surface waves are also possible at an interface
between two dissimilar discrete media in 1D geometries
[87, 91] as well as in 2D settings, e.g. at the interface between
a square lattice and a hexagonal lattice [92] (see figure 31(a),
where the interface is marked with a black dotted line).
Importantly, the generalized dispersion relations (compare
equation (7)) for the square lattice (figure 31(b)) and the
hexagonal lattice (figure 31(c)) are different. Additionally,
the hexagonal region exhibits a higher packing density of
the waveguides, leading to a higher mean refractive index.
In figure 32, a sequence of output intensity distributions is
shown, which demonstrate the interplay of interface reflection,
enhanced light penetration into the region with higher mean
refractive index and nonlinear propagation. The sample was
105 mm long, and the spacing between adjacent guides was
40 μm in this case. Additionally, the refractive index of the
individual guides in the hexagonal lattice is slightly higher,
achieved by a slightly lower writing speed in this region
(1800 μm s−1 ), compared to the square region (2000 μm s−1 ).
When a waveguide in the first (interface) row of the square
array is excited, for low peak power Ppeak = 40 kW the light
is almost confined to the square region since it is reflected at
the interface (figure 32(a)). For increasing power the light
starts to penetrate into the hexagonal region (figures 32(b) and
(c), for Ppeak = 1400 kW and Ppeak = 2000 kW, respectively)
because nonlinearity increases the refractive index and causes
phase matching of both array sections. However, even
for large input peak powers one can clearly observe nearinterface localization (figures 32(d) (Ppeak = 2300 kW) and
(e) (Ppeak = 2700 kW)), so that finally at Ppeak = 3200 kW an
interface lattice soliton forms (figure 32(f)). Note the reduced
power threshold compared to the surface soliton case, which,
however, is still higher than for 2D solitons in the array bulk.

efficiencies, a further extension to materials with tailored
nonlinear response such as periodically poled LiNbO3 [101] is
also a very promising approach. The experimental focus will
be on the precise control of the waveguide properties in these
media, including the handling of spherical aberrations, which
is important for the fabrication of 2D geometries.
To summarize, it was demonstrated that fabricating
complex refractive index landscapes with the fs laser-writing
approach has a variety of advantages leaving these structures
as an important alternative to common fabrication techniques.
Due to the diversity of topologies which are realizable, the
multiple degrees of freedom and the high temporal stability
of the waveguides, in a couple of years the fs-laser-writing
technique may become a major technique for the fabrication
of integrated optical devices. Owing to the unique properties
of the discrete propagation of light, all-optical switching and
routing devices will progress from theoretical considerations
to real-world applications in numerous operational areas.

Conclusion
Arrays of optical waveguides provide an exceptional tool
for studying various optical phenomena in the linear regime
as well as in the nonlinear regime. Particularly, this socalled discrete optics has the potential to mimic many
different quantum systems in a fully classical domain. The
fs-laser-writing approach for the fabrication of waveguide
arrays thereby exhibits a variety of advantages such as
the stability and homogeneity of the waveguides and the
evanescent coupling, the processing speed and the possibility
of fabricating arbitrary 1D and 2D topologies for linear and
nonlinear light propagation. Furthermore, it is possible to
precisely control the properties of every single waveguide, to
generate sharply defined surfaces or artificial defects. This
allows analysis of the influence of boundary and interfacing
effects, making fs-laser-written waveguide arrays today the
only systems where complex two-dimensional interfaces can
be realized [93]. The additional possibility of writing the
waveguides along arbitrary paths with high precision allows
the implementation of external potentials by curving the
guides.
Although all examples in this tutorial have been restricted
to fused silica, the fs writing technique allows us to process
a variety of materials [94–97], which exhibit other kinds of
nonlinearity, in particular a χ (2) nonlinearity, as can be found
e.g. in LiNbO3 [98–100]. In order to obtain high nonlinear
