The shape of deposits obtained from drying drops containing colloidal particles matters for technologies such as
inkjet printing, microelectronics, and bioassay manufacturing. In this work, the formation of deposits during the drying
of nanoliter drops containing colloidal particles is investigated experimentally with microscopy and profilometry, and
theoretically with an in-house finite-element code. The system studied involves aqueous drops containing titania
nanoparticles evaporating on a glass substrate. Deposit shapes from spotted drops at different pH values are measured
using a laser profilometer. Our results show that the pH of the solution influences the dried deposit pattern, which can be
ring-like or more uniform. The transition between these patterns is explained by considering how DLVO interactions
such as the electrostatic and van der Waals forces modify the particle deposition process. Also, a phase diagram is
proposed to describe how the shape of a colloidal deposit results from the competition among three flow patterns: a
radial flow driven by evaporation at the wetting line, a Marangoni recirculating flow driven by surface tension gradients,
and the transport of particles toward the substrate driven by DLVO interactions. This phase diagram explains three
types of deposits commonly observed experimentally, such as a peripheral ring, a small central bump, or a uniform layer.
Simulations and experiments are found in very good agreement.

1. Introduction
In biology, spotting and evaporation of drops containing
colloidal particles is used for depositing and organizing biological
materials such as proteins and DNA.1-7 Colloidal deposition
and crystallization8-14 can also be used to manufacture microand nanowires,15,16 nanocrystals,17 cosmetics, and explosive

evaporating drop containing colloidal particles can exhibit a ringlike structure,19 a central bump,20 a uniform deposit,21,22 or
complex patterns involving multiple rings, a network of polygons,23 hexagonal arrays,17 or Marangoni tongues. This variety of
patterns reflects the complex, coupled, and multiscale nature of
the transport phenomena occurring during the droplet evaporation. The fluid dynamics involved in droplet evaporation is
transient. It depends on the Reynolds and Weber numbers of
the droplet impact, on the impact angle and associated interfacial
deformation or break-up, on the Marangoni and wetting stresses,
and on the evaporation at the free surface. Heat transfer occurs by
convection inside the drop and conduction in the substrate, driven
by a latent heat contribution at the evaporating free surface. Mass
transfer occurs through diffusion of liquid vapor in the atmosphere, advection-diffusion of particles in the drop, and longrange interactions between the charged particles and substrate
surfaces.
Over the past decade, theoretical and experimental efforts have
been made to explain the mechanisms responsible for two of the
most common deposits, the peripheral ring and the central
bump. In 1997, Deegan et al. found that a peripheral ring deposit
forms19,24,25 because of a strong radial flow carrying particles
toward the pinned wetting line, where evaporative flux is highest
due to the wedge geometry. The formation of a central bump, i.e.,
a hilly accumulation with a diameter much smaller than the initial
wetted diameter of the drop, was explained by Hu and Larson22 as

caused by recirculation loops due to thermal Marangoni stresses
along the free surface. Very recently, Ristenpart et al.26 showed
analytically that the ratio between the substrate and droplet
thermal conductivities controls the direction of Marangoni convection inside an evaporating drop, with a direct effect on the
deposit pattern.
For applications such as inkjet printing27,28 and bioassays1-7,29,
a uniform deposit with diameter equivalent to the initial wetted
diameter might be desired in place of a ring or a central bump.
While the mechanisms responsible for ring and central bumps are
well-understood, several mechanisms and explanations have,
however, been put forth to explain the formation of uniform
deposit. For instance, Park and Moon30 investigated the particle
deposition morphologies that resulted from evaporating jetted

microdroplets. By varying the chemical composition of the ink,
they showed that the deposit structure can change from a ring to a
uniform two-dimensional monolayer with a well-ordered hexagonal structure.30 Sommer et al.31,32 studied the patterns formed by
hydroxyapatite particles (60 nm diameter) suspended in 10 μL
aqueous drops on a titanium disk. They explained the transition
from a ring to a uniform deposit pattern as the result of
competition between hydrodynamic and van der Waals forces.
Yan et al.33 observed both ordered and disordered particle
assembly during ring formation depending on different surface
charges and the kind of surfactants. Capillary forces have also
been mentioned as responsible for controlling the deposit shape:
Andreeva et al.34 reported ring and uniform patterns formation
for aqueous drops on, respectively, hydrophilic and hydrophobic
surfaces, and Onoda and Somasundaran35 showed that deposit
patterns on scratched surfaces could be explained by larger
capillary forces on a hydrophobic surfaces than on hydrophilic
surfaces. In the 1990s, the role of capillary forces during the
evaporation of thin aqueous films containing micrometersize polystyrene particles was investigated by the Ivanov group.
They found that, during the last stages of the evaporation,
attractive capillary forces were responsible for the ordering of
the particles.11,12,36
Besides experiments showing deposit patterns and their qualitative interpretations, few numerical and analytical studies have
been reported to quantitatively analyze the formation of colloidal
deposits. One reason is that modeling drop evaporation is
challenging, given the wide range of transport phenomena, time
scales, and length scales. The explanation of the coffee-ring
pattern, or ring deposition, in Deegan et al.19,24,25 was based on
the lubrication approximation, with an analytical expression for
the local evaporative flux. Hu and Larson22 computed the
deposition of PMMA particles by combining an analytical flow
field with Brownian dynamics simulations. Widjaja and Harris37
predicted particle concentrations using a finite element numerical
model solving a continuum advection-diffusion equation. Using
potential flow, Petsi and Burganos38 analytically showed that the
radial outward flow during the evaporation of a drop was
slower on a hydrophobic surface than on a hydrophilic surface.
They used this finding to explain the formation of multiple rings
seen in experiments on hydrophobic surfaces.39
This paper aims at investigating the role of DerjaguinLandau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) interactions on the shape
of the patterns left by evaporated drops. To do so, we perform
experiments where the pH of the drop containing colloidal
particles is varied. The influence of the pH variation on the
DLVO forces is quantified and shown to control the deposit from
a ring-like pattern to a more uniform layer (sections 2 and 4.1).
We also describe a numerical modeling for the evaporation of
droplets containing colloidal particles that considers van der
Waals and electrostatic forces between the particles and the
substrate (section 3). Comparison between experiments and

simulations in section 4.2 shows good agreement and explains
qualitatively and quantitatively the observed deposit shapes. In
the next section (4.3), we put forth a phase diagram describing how
deposits patterns such as a uniform layer, a central bump, or a
peripheral ring result from the competition between three flow
patterns: the radial flow driven by evaporation at the wetting line,
the Marangoni recirculating flow, and the transport of particles
toward the substrate driven by Derjaguin-Landau-VerweyOverbeek (DLVO) interactions.

2. Experimental Details
Titania particles (Sigma-Aldrich Inc., anatase nanopowder,
637254-500G) with an average diameter of 25 ( 2 nm were
dispersed in water using stirring. Solutions at five pH values from
1.4 to 11.7 were obtained by adding hydrochloric acid (0.1 M) or
sodium hydroxide (0.01 M). The pH was measured using a digital
pH meter (Accumet basic, AB15, Fisher Scientific Inc.). The
surface area of the particles was measured as 117.7 ( 1 m2/g with
a Quantasorb Surface Area Analyzer (Quantachrome Instruments Inc., Monosorb). To do so, particles were initially loaded
in a glass sample cell, preheated at 70 °C for half an hour to
remove adsorbed humidity. The surface charge density of titania
particles was determined as a function of the pH by measuring the
adsorbed potential-determining ions (here Hþ) with a backtitration method.40 In this method, titania particles are diluted
into aqueous solutions at various initial values of pH at a
concentration of 0.2 mg/mL. The amount ΔV of hydrochloric
acid or sodium hydroxide that is equivalent for bringing the
particle suspension back to the pH of the initial aqueous solution
is calculated using titration curves. The number of potential
determining ions Δn being adsorbed on the particle is Δn =
CΔV where C is the concentration of hydrochloric acid or sodium
hydroxide. The surface charge density σ can then be calculated as41

where F represents the Faraday Constant (96 500 C/mol), mp is
mass of the particles [kg], and Sp is the specific surface area of the
particles [m2/kg]. The number concentration of the counterions at
infinite distance n is related to the molar concentration Mi of
counterions by
n ¼ 1000Mi NA

ð2Þ

where NA is the Avogadro number.
Immediately after sonicating the solutions for five minutes at a
power of 200 W, nanoliter drops containing colloidal particles
were spotted on soda lime glass slides (Fisher Scientific Inc.) using
a 375 μm diameter stainless steel pin (Telechem International Inc.,
CA), as in ref 42. All experiments were performed without
controlling the ionic strength of the solution. The glass slides
were previously immersed in freshly prepared Piranha solution for
1 h at 70 °C, thoroughly washed with distilled water, and then
blown dry with nitrogen to remove residual water.
The evaporation of water droplets was visualized from the side
using a digital camera (Pixelink, PLA 741, 1.3 megapixel) and an
Optem long-distance zoom objective. Typical time and spatial
resolution were, respectively, 20 frames per second and 1.5 μm per
pixel. The initial observed droplet volumes were typically between
4 and 6 nL. We also used an Olympus IX-71 inverted microscope
to qualitatively assess the structure of the flow inside the drop: the

motion of 25 nm titania particles was recorded at frame rates of
25 frames per second.43 After evaporation, profiles of the deposits
were measured using a laser profilometer based on confocal microscopy (Keyence corporation, LT-9010-M, resolution
∼10 nm). Note that this type of measurement method would not
be appropriate for dried profiles that exhibit azimuthal instabilities, such as fingerings or the dendrimer structures in refs 44,45.

3. Theory and Numerical Modeling
Electrostatic and van der Waals forces between the particles
and the solid substrate were estimated according to the DLVO
theory. When the particles are in a solution, dissolution of ionic
groups or preferential adsorption of ions both induce surface
charges on their solid surfaces. For titania nanoparticles in an
acid/base solution, protonation and deprotonation events control
the sign and value of surface charge density (defined as the charge
per unit area on the solid). The surface potential of the particles
(ψp) can be related to the surface charge density (σp) by the
Gouy-Chapman relation46,47

where εε0 is the total permittivity of the water, kB the Boltzmann
constant, T the absolute temperature (here 298 K), e the electronic
unit charge, and κ-1 the Debye length. We measured the surface
potential (ψp) for the titania particles in water, and our results in
Figure 2 show a point of zero charge at pH 5.4. For the glass
substrate surface, the surface potential (ψs) is assumed to be equal
to the zeta potential (ψs ≈ ζs), with values taken from the
streaming potential measurements by Somasundaran et al.48
The extrapolation of these values for low pH values shows a
point of zero charge at 2.44. Other measurements49 show similar
behavior with a point of zero charge at pH 2.0. The electrostatic
force between a particle and the substrate is calculated using the

based on a finite-element code for droplet impact and heat
transfer developed by Poulikakos and co-workers in refs 52-57,
and Attinger and co-workers in refs 20,55,58. This model has been
validated for studies involving impact and heat transfer of molten
metal52,56 and water drops,58 and for the evaporation of drops
containing colloidal particles.20 The flow inside the droplet
is assumed to be laminar and axisymmetric. All equations are
expressed in a Lagrangian framework, which provides accurate
modeling of free surface deformations and the associated Laplace
stresses.59 The use of a Lagrangian scheme where the nodes
move with the fluid allows precise handling of free surface stresses
and the full treatment of both convection and conduction heat
transfer by solving the heat equation.54 This numerical code also
models the evaporative flux along the drop-air interface, thermocapillary stresses and Marangoni flow, and wetting line motion.20
In addition, the code has a dual time-step scheme to handle
multiple time scales, which range from nanoseconds for capillary
waves at the liquid-air interface to several seconds for the whole
evaporation.20 The motion of particles is tracked by solving an
advection-diffusion equation for the particle concentration, neglecting buoyancy. The interaction of the free surface of the drop
with the growing deposit is modeled20 using wetting angles criteria
to predict the detachment of the drop liquid from the ring, or
depinning. According to published results showing unexpectedly
small Marangoni convection in aqueous drops,60,61 Marangoni
convection is not considered in the simulations presented here. In
this paper, our numerical modeling is extended to consider the
attractive DLVO force between the colloidal particles and the
substrate, as follows.
The governing equation for the particles transport is given
by6,62

where X is the concentration of the particles [kg of particles/kg of
solution] and Dpl is the diffusion coefficient of the particles in the
drop liquid (1.7 Â 10-11 m2/s for 25 nm titania particles in water,
calculated using the Stokes-Einstein equation63). In the above
equation, the advection velocity v = vfluid þ vDLVO. The symbol
vfluid stands for the hydrodynamic velocity of the fluid. The
velocity vDLVO is estimated by balancing the DLVO force (FDLVO,
eq 9) and the corresponding hydrodynamic drag force (Fdrag) for a
particle. In the case of an attractive DLVO force, we have
vDLVO þ ¼ - ð2FDLVO þ =6πμdp Þnz

The numerical modeling used in this paper is described in detail
in our earlier work20 and is briefly described here. This model is

where the unit vector nz is normal to the substrate. For the sake of
numerical tractability, the following assumptions are made. The
numerical code is based on the continuum assumption and does not
account for collisions of individual particles. The pH of the droplet
gradually changes during the drying process, since the volatilities of
water and hydrochloric acid/sodium hydroxide are different. This
results in a varying DLVO force with time. However, in our
simulations the pH values are assumed constant with time and

solid substrate, are not considered in the modeling.

4. Results and Discussion
In section 4.1, we describe experimentally the formation of
deposits during the evaporation of 4-6 nL water droplets at
various pH values. The initial volume fraction of 25 nm titania
nanoparticles is 2%. In the same section, the pH is shown to
control the deposit shape. In section 4.2, numerical simulations
are presented at two specific values of pH, resulting, respectively,
in a ring and a uniform deposit, both in very good agreement with
the experiments. Finally, in section 4.3 a phase diagram is put
forth that describes how the shape of a colloidal deposit results
from the competition between three characteristic flow patterns.
4.1. Experimental Results. Figure 3 shows micrographs of
deposit patterns obtained at six pH values. The deposit structure
at pHs 1.4 and 2.8 is a thin uniform layer with a thicker ring at the
periphery. Deposit structures at pHs 5.8 and 6.7 show the initial
wetted area covered randomly by particle aggregates. The deposit
at the highest pH value, pH 11.7, is a ring with almost no particles
at the center of the deposit. Measured deposit profiles corresponding to four different pH values are shown in Figure 4. These
different deposit patterns can be explained by considering the
electrostatic and van der Waals forces between the particles and
the substrate, the sum of which is called here DLVO force. In
Table 1, calculations show an attractive DLVO force for pH e 5.8
and a repulsive force for pH > 5.8. In the latter case, the particles
are prevented from contacting the substrate and follow the
general flow pattern, which is radially toward the wetting line.
The associated movie43 shows the motion of 25 nm titania
particles inside the evaporating drop, which accumulate as a ring
at the periphery. A radial, outward flow is observed to start at 2 s,
and the developing ring is visible from t = 2 to 6 s. This explains
the ring observed at pH 11.7, with profile as in Figure 4d. When
the DLVO force is attractive, the particles close to the substrate
are attracted to and form the layer measured at the center of the
deposits in Figure 4a,b for the pHs 1.4 and 2.8 cases. Since the
range of DLVO forces is on the order of the Debye length, much
less than the droplet height, a significant amount of particles are
not attracted to the substrate and accumulates as a ring. The
associated movie64 shows the motion of 25 nm titania particles
inside the evaporating drop. A radial, outward flow is observed to
start at 2 s, and the deposition of particles at the drop-substrate
interface with the developing ring is visible from t = 2 to 8 s. The
main difference between the deposits at low vs high pH is that at
low pH a relatively thick uniform deposit forms, exhibiting a
peripheral ring, while at high pH, almost all particles are deposited in a peripheral ring (see Figure 4a,b). These deposits can
therefore be explained by the competition between the two flow
regimes shown at the top and at the middle of Figure 7.
The deposit structure in Figure 3 for intermediate pH values is
more complex, with the agglomerated particles sparsely spread
over the entire initial wetted area. This can be explained by taking
into account the fact that, near the point of zero charge of the
particles, the DLVO force between the particles and the substrate
becomes smaller than the van der Waals forces between the
particles, as shown in Table 1: this causes flocculation. Another
explanation would be that capillary instabilities occur in the later
stages of the drying, when the drop has a film shape, and induce
these islands of particles. The associated movie65 invalidates the

second hypothesis, showing that the flocculation occurs from the
very early stages of the deposition.
4.2. Comparison between Numerical and Experimental
Results. In this section, we describe numerical simulations
performed for two specific cases at pH of 11.7 and 1.1. In the first
case, a 5 nL water droplet containing 2% volume fraction titania
particles of 25 nm diameter evaporates at ambient temperature at
pH = 11.7 (Tamb = 25.5 °C, Figure 3). The second case corresponds to the evaporation of a 4 nL water droplet at pH = 1.1 in a
refrigerator with ambient temperature of 10.9 °C. The particle size
and concentration are same as in the first case. The values of the
electrostatic force and the parameters used for their calculation are
given in Table 1 and Table 2, respectively. Values for the surface
potentials were obtained from measurements in Figure 2.
For both cases, the van der Waals force is attractive and
expressed as

The magnitude and sign of the three forces (Fel, FvdW, and their
sum FDLVO) is shown in Table 1 for the two cases. For pH = 11.7,
the repulsive electrostatic force is 1 order of magnitude higher
than attractive van der Waals force, while for pH = 1.1, the
attractive van der Waals force is 1 order of magnitude larger than
the repulsive electrostatic force. Thus, the force between the
particle and the substrate is repulsive for pH = 11.7 and attractive
for pH = 1.1. The final expression of the forces are given as
follows for the two cases

for water on glass (φreceding ∼1° in ref 66), and because of the

packing.67 A view of the growing ring is shown in red from t =
5.4-7.2 s, with a skewed z-axis to better show the ring formation.
Figure 6a compares the final deposit shapes obtained experimentally and numerically. The numerical profile corresponding to the
lower value of the depinning angle (φrec = 25°,68 used throughout
the simulation in Figure 5a) appears to match the experimental
profile better than another simulation with larger depinning
angle (φrec = 85°). In the latter case, depinning has occurred
too abruptly, resulting in an inner slope of the ring that is steeper
than in the measurement.
Comparison between the deposit profiles obtained by simulation and measurement for pH = 2.8 is shown in Figure 6b. The
measured profile is more uniform than the deposit in Figure 6a
and shows a peripheral ring along with a uniform deposit within
the wetted area. The measured height of the ring is around twice
the height of the uniform deposit within the wetted area
(Figure 6b). Due to the attractive DLVO force between the
particles and the substrate at pH = 2.8 (see Table 1), a uniform
layer of particles deposits at the bottom of the drop.
To increase the uniformity of the deposit profile over the entire
wetted area, another experiment is performed in which a 4 nL
water droplet at pH = 1.1 evaporates in a refrigerator with
ambient temperature of 10.9 °C, which corresponds to a final
evaporation time of 16 s, almost twice the final evaporation time
for the droplet at Tamb = 25.5 °C. Figure 5c describes the corresponding numerical simulation, with parameters described in Table 4. Streamlines and velocity amplitudes are shown left, and
particle concentrations are shown right. A similar radial flow
pattern to that in Figure 5a is observed, however, with a lower
intensity. In Figure 5c also, the DLVO force between the particles
and the substrate is attractive (eq 14, see Table 1). This causes a
uniform layer of particles to be deposited at the bottom of the drop.
Note that by lowering the ambient temperature the evaporation
time is almost doubled. The corresponding reduction in evaporation flux inhibits the tendency of particles to flow to the wetting line
and allows more time for the particles to be attracted toward the
substrate. This results in a more uniform deposit over the entire
wetted area. Figure 6c compares the profile of the deposit measured
by laser profilometer with the simulation results. The measurement
shows a uniform deposit with average height of about 400 nm. The
structure, shape, and height of the deposit calculated numerically
with φrec = 25° 68 reproduce this deposit structure qualitatively and
quantitatively. The measured profile in Figure 6c shows a relatively
uniform deposit, with some noise due to light scattering.
Simulations at intermediate pH value (pH = 5.8) could not reproduce the deposit profile given by the experiment. Experiment
shows a deposit profile with flocculated particles (Figure 4c and

Figure 3, measured deposit height ∼0.5 μm), while the simulation
predicts a ring pattern (height ∼1.7 μm) with a very thin layer of
deposit at the center (height ∼0.05 μm). The reason for this
discrepancy is proposed to be particle aggregation due to the
dominance of attractive interparticle van der Waals forces (see
Table 1), which is very reasonable given the low surface potential
value. These aggregates will then tend to deposit over the entire area
by sedimentation. As mentioned in section 3, this attractive force
between the particles is not included in the numerical model.
4.3. Phase Diagram. In this section, we propose a phase
diagram for predicting the deposit shapes from evaporated drops
containing colloidal particles observed in this paper and in our
previous study.20 The diagram in Figure 8 puts forth that the
deposit shape results from the competition of three convective
flow patterns, each inducing a specific deposit shape, as shown in
Figure 7. The magnitude of each flow pattern can be estimated
using analytical relations. The first flow pattern is the radial flow
caused by the maximum evaporation rate at the pinned wetting
line, and the corresponding deposit is a peripheral ring. An
analytical expression for the radial velocity is provided by Hu
and Larson,69 which scales as Vrad ∼ j/F.
The second relevant flow pattern is the transport of particles
normally toward the substrate, occurring in the case of an
attractive DLVO force. The corresponding deposit pattern is a
uniform layer with diameter equal to the initial wetted diameter.
This velocity scales as in the eq 11 of the present paper: VDLVOþ
∼ 2FDLVO/6πμdp, where FDLVOþ is the magnitude of the attractive DLVO force calculated at the Debye length.
The third flow pattern is a Marangoni recirculation loop, and
the corresponding deposit is a central bump, i.e., a hilly accumulation with a diameter much smaller than the initial wetted
diameter of the drop. The typical loop velocity is given analytically by Hu and Larson60 and scales as VMa ∼ (1/32)(βφi2ΔT/μ).
In this equation, φ is the wetting angle of the drop, μ is dynamic
viscosity, β is the gradient of surface tension with respect to the
temperature, and ΔT is the temperature difference between the
edge and the top of the droplet.
In Figure 8, we express the competition between these three
convective flow patterns using a two-dimensional phase diagram.
The horizontal axis expresses the ratio of the Marangoni recirculation over the radial flow, VMa/Vrad. The vertical axis expresses
the ratio of the particle deposition driven by DLVO forces over
the radial flow, VDLVOþ/Vrad. In Figure 8, five deposit patterns
(A-E) obtained experimentally in this paper and in our previous
study are shown for the three domains of the phase diagram. For a
system where Marangoni effect and DLVO forces are negligible
with respect to the radial flow caused by a maximum evaporation
rate at the wetting line, the pattern is a ring (Figure 7(1)). This case
corresponds to VMa/Vrad = 0 and VDLVOþ/Vrad = 0 and falls on

the particles and the substrate; in (3), a central bump forms due to a
Marangoni recirculation loop.

velocities (Vrad, VDLVOþ, and VMa) determines the final pattern

scale caused by an attractive DLVO force, and VMa is the Marangoni
velocity scale. Cases A, B, C, and E are experiments performed in this
work, while case D is an experiment performed in ref 20.

the origin of the map shown in Figure 8 (case C). In a system
where the attractive DLVO forces between particles and substrate
dominate over radially outward flow and over Marangoni convection, the pattern is a uniform deposit over the entire wetted
area (Figure 7(2)). The deposit is smooth if interparticle forces are
negligible or is a uniform dispersion of flocculated particles if
interparticle forces are important. Such system is shown as case E
Langmuir 2010, 26(11), 7833–7842

in Figure 8 for the case VDLVOþ/Vrad ≈ 2.8 Â 105. For a system where
Marangoni convection dominates over radially outward flow and
over attractive DLVO forces, the deposition pattern will be a central
bump (Figure 7(3)). Such system is shown as case D in Figure 8 for
the case VMa/Vrad ≈ 34. The phase diagram has therefore three
domains, a bottom left corner where the deposit tends to be a ring, a
top left zone where the deposit tends to be a uniform layer, and a
bottom right zone where the deposit tends to be a central bump.

5. Conclusions
This paper describes the influence of the DLVO forces on the
shape of deposits left by drying drop containing colloidal particles.

Experiments are performed where the pH is used to control
DLVO forces between the colloidal particles. An in-house numerical modeling able to simulate the evaporation of a drop containing colloidal particles is extended to consider the van der Waals
and electrostatic forces between the particles and the deposit.
Agreement between the simulations and the experiments is very
good, with a discrepancy at intermediate pH that is attributed to
the neglect of interparticle forces. A phase diagram is put forth to
explain that the ratio of three characteristic velocities determines
the deposit to be either a peripheral ring, a central bump and a
uniform deposit.
