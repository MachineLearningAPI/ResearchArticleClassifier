ABSTRACT: A plethora of organic micropollutant mixtures are found in untreated municipal wastewater. Anaerobic digesters receive large loadings of
hydrophobic micropollutants that sorb to wastewater biosolids. Despite micropollutants being pervasive as mixtures, little research is available to explain the
impact that mixtures of compounds, as well as exposure time, have on microbial communities in anaerobic digesters. Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) was
added to anaerobic enrichment cultures in both short-term (14Â days) and long-term (140Â days) studies to determine the impact of exposure time. Additionally,
triclosan was added during the experiments to investigate the impact of mixtures on community structure and function. PFOS did not alter methane production in short-term studies, but in long-term studies, methane production increased, consistent with our hypothesis that PFOS may act as a metabolic uncoupler. The impact of triclosan on methane production was exacerbated when PFOS was already present in the anaerobic enrichment cultures. Triclosan also had
greater impacts on microbial community structures in the bottles that had been exposed to PFOS long-term. These results demonstrate that both chemical
mixtures and exposure time are important parameters to address when trying to define the impacts of micropollutants on anaerobic microbial communities.

Introduction

Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) is an organic surfactant that is
ubiquitous in the environment and has been found in the tissues
of many animals, including bald eagles, polar bears, and marine
animals.1,2 PFOS has been found at nanogram per liter levels in
surface waters3,4 and was recently listed under the Stockholm
Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants.5 Wastewater
treatment plants receive PFOS directly with influent sewage,
and it also forms as other fluorinated surfactants degrade.6 In
residual wastewater biosolids in the USA, PFOS is typically
detected at concentrations between 10 and 100Â Î¼g (PFOS)/kg
(dry solids), with levels up to 2,610Â Î¼g/kg; in Switzerland, concentrations as high as 600Â Î¼g/kg have been detected.7â€“11
The impacts of PFOS in biological systems are mixed.
PFOS at very high concentrations, 500Â  mg/L, caused no
detectable impacts on hydrogenotrophic methanogens in granular sludge when the exposure time was limited to 24Â hours.12
Interestingly, an alcohol alkoxylate surfactant present at
200Â  mg/L inhibited methanogenic activity after 9Â  days, but
no inhibition was seen for the first 2Â days of the experiment.13

Therefore, exposure time could be an important factor in assessing PFOS impacts and associated risk. In eukaryotes, PFOS
has been linked to detrimental effects, causing mitochondrial
cell membranes to leak at 5Â mg/L.14 At 30Â mg/L, PFOS both
increased and decreased the impacts of chlorinated compounds
on algal cells,15 suggesting that the impact of PFOS as a constituent of mixtures should also be further studied.
Because of the potential importance of exposure time and
mixture effects, the objective of this research was to more fully
explore the short-term and long-term impacts of PFOS, alone
and in mixtures, on methanogenic communities. Methanogenic communities were selected as the focus of this research
because PFOS is found in biosolids along with other micropollutants, such as triclosan.7,16,17 Experiments were performed
with methanogenic communities amended with environmentally relevant levels of PFOS, and in some cases, the ubiquitous antimicrobial triclosan. It was hypothesized that PFOS
would have minimal impacts on communities alone, but would
augment the impacts of triclosan. It was also hypothesized
that effects would only be observed after PFOS exposure was

One set of control cultures, one set of PFOS (60) cultures, and one set of PFOS (800) cultures were perturbed over
the course of the experiment (Table 2) to study the effect of
PFOS addition and stress on community structure and function. Perturbations included triclosan amendment. Triclosan
(Irgasan, Sigma Aldrich, $97% [high-performance liquid
chromatography]) was quantified gravimetrically and then
dissolved in a methanol solution. The methanol solution was
fed into the serum bottles with a gas tight syringe; again, control cultures received methanol containing no triclosan.

Long-term PFOS exposure tests. This experiment was
designed to test the hypothesis that long-term exposure of
methanogenic communities to PFOS inhibits methane production, shifts microbial community structure, and renders
communities more susceptible to the effects of triclosan. Experiments were performed for 140Â days at environmentally relevant
low (60Â Î¼g/kg) and high (800Â Î¼g/kg) PFOS concentrations.7
Methanogenic source cultures. Three-liter benchscale anaerobic digesters were used to provide innocula for
the smaller anaerobic serum bottles. These 3-L bench-scale
digesters were seeded with biosolids from a full-scale anaerobic digester that treated cow manure (Haubenschild Farms).18
The 3-L cultures were fed a synthetic feed that included (percent chemical oxygen demand (COD) in parenthesis): ethanol
(40.5%), potassium acetate (10.9%), sodium acetate (9.4%),
propionic acid (11.4%), butyric acid (8.5%), valeric acid (2.8%),
2-propanol (4%), and methanol (1.6%)18 in minimal media.19
The organic loading rate was 0.18Â  g COD/L/day and the
hydraulic retention time (HRT) was 60Â days.
Anaerobic serum bottle cultures. Anaerobic enrichment cultures were constructed from 160-mL serum bottles
with 50Â  mL of active volume. Serum bottles were initially
filled with 20Â  mL of biomass (12Â  g volatile solids (VS)/L)
from the 3-L source cultures and 30Â mL of minimal media.19
Once a week 7Â mL of the culture contents were removed and
7Â  mL of minimal media were added along with 0.2Â  mL of
feed to provide organic loading rates of 0.05Â g COD/L/day as
acetate, 0.06Â g COD/L/day as glucose, and 0.09Â g COD/L/
day as methanol; the average organic loading rate was 0.20Â g
COD/L/day. The mean HRT was 50Â days. Nitrogen gas was
used to purge the culture headspace, which were plugged
with Teflon-lined septa and crimp-capped with aluminum
seals. Cultures were incubated resting upright in the dark at
37Â°C. Periodically, a 1.5-mL aliquot of biomass was sampled
from each culture for DNA extraction followed by microbial
analysis.
Six sets of serum bottle cultures were operated in triplicate (Table 1). Two sets of cultures, called PFOS (60), were
exposed to PFOS at approximately 60Â Î¼g/kg; two sets of cultures, called PFOS (800), were exposed to PFOS at 800Â Î¼g/
kg; and two sets of control cultures were not exposed to PFOS.
PFOS (Sigma Aldrich, 97%) was weighed gravimetrically and dissolved in methanol. This stock solution was further
diluted with methanol to achieve desired concentrations. The
PFOSâ€“methanol solutions were added to cultures with a gas
tight syringe, and the control cultures received methanol containing no PFOS. The mass of PFOS in the culture at any given
time was calculated from Equation 1, and the concentration

the biomass was protective and short-term exposure to PFOS,
even at high concentrations, would not impact methane production or alter the impacts of triclosan in a PFOS mixture.
PFOS concentrations were set to 5Ã— environmental levels in
this short-term experiment to test a worst-case environmental
scenario. If short-term effects were not observed at these concentrations then it would be presumed that current environmental levels do not have short-term effects. Anaerobic serum
bottles (160Â mL) were initially set up and fed as described for
the long-term exposure tests. After 7Â  days, the bottles were
re-fed acetate and glucose. The bottles were amended with
micropollutants on Day 0. Micropollutants were weighed
gravimetrically and dissolved in methanol. The micropollutant
solutions were added with a gas tight syringe. The concentrations of micropollutants in the cultures were calculated from
the mass of micropollutant added and divided by the total
solids present (Table 3). The experiment lasted for 14Â days.
DNA extraction and automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (ARISA). To extract DNA, biomass samples (1.5Â  mL) were centrifuged (13,200 g) for
1.5Â minutes, the supernatant was discarded, and pellets were
frozen at âˆ’20Â°C until extraction. Lysis buffer (MP Biomedicals) was added to pellets, and cells were lysed with
three freezeâ€“thaw cycles followed by incubation at 70Â°C for
90Â  minutes. The DNA was extracted using the FastDNA
Spin Kit (MP Biomedicals), and the extracts were kept at
âˆ’20Â°C until use.18 Community fingerprints were assessed
by ARISA following the procedure described previously.18
Briefly, primers ITSF and ITSReub were used to amplify
the intergenic spacer region of Bacteria. 20 The phosphoramidite dye HEX was used to label the forward primers.

triphosphates, 25Â pmol forward and reverse primers, 1 Ã— PCR
buffer (Promega), 1.25 units of GoTaq DNA polymerase
(Promega), and approximately 1Â  ng of genomic DNA. The
PCR protocol consisted of 3Â  minutes of initial denaturation
at 94Â°C, 35 cycles of 94Â°C for 45Â seconds, 55Â°C for 1Â minute,
72Â°C for 2Â minutes, and a final extension of 7Â minutes at 72Â°C.
PCR products were separated by capillary electrophoresis,
and peak areas were analyzed with PeakScanner Software
version 1.0. Fragment lengths ,156Â  bp were removed from
subsequent analyses to eliminate primer dimers.20 Fragments
.1,000Â bp were eliminated because the maximum size standard was 1,000Â bp. Peaks had to account for at least 0.5% of
the total area in a sample to be used for further analysis. The
relative contribution of one operational taxonomic unit (OTU)
normalized to the total community (area of one OTU divided
by area of all OTUs) was averaged across replicates, and this
average contribution was used for statistical analysis.18,21,22
Analytical methods. The biogas produced by each culture was quantified by measuring the displacement volume of
a wetted glass syringe. Methane was quantified on a gas chromatograph equipped with a thermal conductivity detector as
described previously.23 The detection limit was 0.95Â nmol of
methane per microliter of sample injected.18 Samples from the
cultures were dried overnight at 105Â°C to determine the total
solids content. VS were determined by quantifying the mass
that volatilized upon heating the dried sample for 2Â hours at
550Â°C. Total and volatile suspended solids (TSS and VSS)
were quantified by passing a known volume of sample through
a glass fiber filter (Millipore AP4004700) and drying the filter
at 105Â°C (TSS) and then at 550Â°C (VSS).
Statistical analysis. Analysis of variance (ANOVA)
and Studentâ€™s t-tests were performed using Graphpad Prism
v.Â  5.04 (Graphpad Software, Inc.). A P-value of #0.05 was
considered significant. ARISA data were plotted and analyzed using nonmetric multidimensional scaling (nMDS).
RÂ was used for nMDS analysis using the vegan package. The
distance between samples in nMDS plots correlates to dissimilarity between samples.24

Results and Discussion

Long-term PFOS exposure tests. In serum bottle
cultures that were exposed to 800Â  Î¼g/kg PFOS and simultaneously perturbed, the community structure shifted and
methane production increased 51% relative to control cultures (Figs. 2 and 3). This increase was statistically significant
(ANOVA, P = 0.018). At these higher but still environmentally relevant concentrations,7 PFOS could have been exerting
subtle uncoupling impacts, as observed previously with fluorinated surfactants.14 The mixing perturbation that occurred
at Day 3 could have increased the mass transfer of PFOS
into biomass flocs. The ARISA profiles revealed that PFOS
had no impact on Bacteria community structure through the
first 50Â days, but by Day 115, the higher levels of PFOS had

shifted the community profile away from the control, and this
shift persisted through Day 140, which was at the end of the
experiment (Fig. 3).
Surfactants have been observed to produce subtle, broadspectrum inhibitory effects on bacteria. Effects of the surfactant nonylphenol on bacteria are more widely studied than the
effects of PFOS, and nonylphenol has been shown to inhibit
Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aereus, and nitrifiers.25â€“27 Both
compounds, however, have been linked to the increases in
membrane permeability.14,28 An increase in membrane permeability would diminish the proton motive force and force
microorganisms to consume more substrate to maintain ATP
levels; this could explain the increase in methane concentrations observed in these cultures. Alternatively, chemical
uncouplers could also decrease microbial biomass as a result of
less availability of ATP for anabolic activity.29â€“31 No statistical
difference was observed between the solids content in control

reactors or any of the PFOS-exposed reactors (two-way
ANOVA, P = 0.9101 for the effect of treatment; Supplementary
Fig. 1). These gravimetric solids measurements, however, may
not be sensitive enough to accurately determine changes in
biomass as a result of uncoupling. The increase in gas production implies that microbes increased their respiration rates to
maintain ATP levels. Future work should be conducted with
real-time measurement of ATP levels to further understand
the impacts of PFOS on microbes.
Results from this study are different from those of
Hollingsworth et al,12 who found that PFOS had no impact
on hydrogenotrophic methanogens. Other than exposure
time, another difference between the two studies is that
Hollingsworth et al fed only H2/CO2, and thus the impacts
of PFOS on Bacteria and acetoclastic methanogens were not
tested. Methanogenesis is a syntrophic, sequential process. ItÂ is
feasible that PFOS uncouples Bacteria, causing faster turnover of methanogenic substrate followed by increased methane
production. Alternatively, acetoclastic methanogens, which
are thought to account for approximately two-thirds of methane production during anaerobic digestion,32 may be impacted
by PFOS. As opposed to the results of Hollingsworth and
coworkers, the results presented herein demonstrate that, over
exposure times of .50Â days, PFOS can alter the function and
structure of a methanogenic community at environmentally relevant levels if other perturbations, which are common in both
engineered and natural systems, also occur.
PFOS also exacerbated the impacts of triclosan on methane production and community structure. When communities were amended with PFOS, triclosan addition had greater
impacts on the methane production rate relative to control
communities to which no PFOS was added (Fig. 4, Table 4).
In the PFOS (60) and PFOS (800) sets of cultures, triclosan
amendment led to significantly higher methane production
rates compared to just methanol amendment (Table 4). In the
control set of cultures, triclosan amendment did not significantly increase methane production. Subsequently, methane
production declined more rapidly in PFOS cultures amended
with triclosan compared to PFOS cultures amended with only
methanol. Again, no difference in the decline in methane production was observed between control cultures with triclosan
relative to control cultures with just methanol added (TableÂ 4).
These results suggest that PFOS enhanced the potential
uncoupling effects of triclosan.33 In addition, PFOS may have
increased the bioavailability of triclosan. PFOS is a surfactant,
and surfactants have been shown to increase the bioavailability of organic compounds.34 This may have resulted in PFOS
impacting the microbesâ€™ ability to take up triclosan, resulting in increased toxicity over time. These results are especially important because PFOS and triclosan are both found
in residual wastewater biosolids.7,17 Nevertheless, because of
the limited number of data points, more work is needed to
corroborate these results. In addition to functional impacts,
triclosan also had larger impacts on the community structure

in those cultures also amended with PFOS, according to the
nMDS analysis (Fig. 5).
Interestingly, other studies have also shown that mixtures containing PFOS alter, both synergistically and antagonistically, the effects of other micropollutants. PFOS exposure
at 30Â mg/L for 72Â hours decreased the inhibition of atrazine
and diuron to algae.15 In contrast, it increased the inhibitory
effects of pentachlorophenol on algae.15 When PFOS was

mixed with either triclosan or trichlorophenol, the inhibition
of algae decreased, but when all three compounds were combined, inhibition increased.35 Thus, evaluating toxicity by
adding the effects of individual compounds could substantially underestimate or overestimate the toxicity of mixtures as
seen in the environment. Indeed, the results presented herein
demonstrated that following 115Â days of exposure to PFOS at
0.02Â mg/L (a relevant concentration in wastewater biosolids,
equivalent to 800Â Î¼g/kg), the impacts of triclosan were more
drastic, by generating faster methane production rates and
causing larger shifts in community structure. PFOS directly
impacted methanogenic communities in this study (Figs.Â  2
and 3), while also appearing to play a role in the impact of
other micropollutants as part of a mixture.
Short-term PFOS exposure tests. While PFOS had
functional and structural effects on methanogenic communities in long-term exposure experiments, no effects were
observed in the short-term 14-day exposure experiments, even
with much higher levels of PFOS added. PFOS did not alter
methane production during the 14-day experiment (Fig.Â  6;
ANOVA P = 0.197). Similarly, PFOS did not alter methane
production during the first 14Â  days of the long-term 140day exposure experiment (Supplementary Fig. 2; ANOVA
PÂ =Â 0.1233). Neither did PFOS augment the impacts of triclosan in these short-term experiments, again indicating that
short-term impacts of PFOS are different than long-term
impacts. These results indicate that more time is likely required
for PFOS to transport into flocs or cells where it can have an
impact on microorganisms. Similarly, an alcohol alkoxylate
surfactant at 200Â mg/L had no effect on methane production
after 2Â days, but after 9Â days the compound was inhibitory.13
Thus, in the 24-hour exposure study by Hollingsworth et al,12
different results may have been observed had their experiments been longer term.

Conclusion

In summary, exposure time, in addition to the presence of other
stressors/perturbations, and whether co-contaminants are
present, matter when assessing the risk and impacts of PFOS.
Overall, this research demonstrated that PFOS has subtle
but definitive impacts on methanogenic community function and structure. Exposure time appears to greatly influence
the impacts of PFOS, as it does with other surfactants13 and

chlorinated chemicals.36,37 Exposure time also influences the
impacts of mixtures. When triclosan was added after 115Â days
of PFOS exposure, methane production and community structure were impacted, but function was not altered when triclosan
and PFOS were added simultaneously in short-term (14Â days)
experiments. Other researchers have demonstrated that PFOS
can alter the toxicity of mixtures in algal cultures.15,35 Tests
designed to evaluate environmental risk must therefore account
for mixtures and incorporate an element of exposure time if
they are to appropriately evaluate chemical risk. While it is
impossible to test all chemicals in every possible mixture for
prolonged periods of time, testing the effects of individual
compounds on one particular microorganism, for example,
E. coli, may do little to establish risk. Additionally, the duration
of the test should reflect the predicted fate of a chemical and
the time that a given chemical will reside in a particular environment. For example, effects from a hydrophobic chemical
that will reside in sediments should be assessed after a much
greater exposure time than those effects from a hydrophilic
chemical that will degrade quickly in river water. Without a
proper understanding of the long-term effects of micropollutants, alone and in mixtures, we could be stressing environments far beyond what has been predicted in laboratories or, if
organisms are protected by flocs, far less.
