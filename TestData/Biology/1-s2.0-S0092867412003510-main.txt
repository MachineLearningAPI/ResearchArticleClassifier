The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway senses and integrates a variety of
environmental cues to regulate organismal growth and homeostasis. The pathway regulates many
major cellular processes and is implicated in an increasing number of pathological conditions,
including cancer, obesity, type 2 diabetes, and neurodegeneration. Here, we review recent
advances in our understanding of the mTOR pathway and its role in health, disease, and aging.
We further discuss pharmacological approaches to treat human pathologies linked to mTOR
deregulation.

Introduction
Most organisms have evolved mechanisms for efficiently transitioning between anabolic and catabolic states, allowing them to
survive and grow in environments in which nutrient availability is
variable. In mammals, an example of such a mechanism is the
signaling network anchored by the protein kinase mTOR (originally "mammalian TOR," but now officially "mechanistic TOR").
This pathway, which responds to diverse environmental cues,
controls many processes that generate or use large amounts
of energy and nutrients. It is increasingly apparent that mTOR
signaling impacts most major cellular functions, giving it an
outsized role in regulating basic cell behaviors such as growth
(mass accumulation) and proliferation. Because mTOR deregulation occurs in human disease, including cancer, obesity, type
2 diabetes, and neurodegeneration, there are significant ongoing
efforts to pharmacologically target the pathway. Here, we review
our current understanding of the mTOR pathway and its role in
health and disease, as well as discuss pharmacological
approaches for modulating mTOR activity.
The mTOR Pathway
mTOR is the target of a molecule named rapamycin or sirolimus,
which is a macrolide produced by Streptomyces Hygroscopicus
bacteria and that first gained attention because of its broad
antiproliferative properties. In the early 1990s, genetic screens
in budding yeast identified TOR1 and TOR2 as mediators of
the toxic effects of rapamycin on yeast (Cafferkey et al., 1993;
Kunz et al., 1993). Shortly afterwards, biochemical approaches
in mammals led to purification of mTOR and its discovery as
the physical target of rapamycin (Brown et al., 1994; Sabatini
et al., 1994; Sabers et al., 1995). mTOR is an atypical serine/
threonine protein kinase that belongs to the phosphoinositide
3-kinase (PI3K)-related kinase family and interacts with several

proteins to form two distinct complexes named mTOR complex
1 (mTORC1) and 2 (mTORC2). The mTOR-containing complexes
have different sensitivities to rapamycin as well as upstream
inputs and downstream outputs (Figure 1, top panel).
Both mTOR complexes are large; with mTORC1 having six
and mTORC2 seven known protein components. They share
the catalytic mTOR subunit, and also mammalian lethal with
sec-13 protein 8 (mLST8, also known as GbL) (Jacinto et al.,
2004; Kim et al., 2003), DEP domain containing mTOR-interacting protein (DEPTOR) (Peterson et al., 2009), and the Tti1/Tel2
complex (Kaizuka et al., 2010). In contrast, regulatory-associated protein of mammalian target of rapamycin (raptor) (Hara
et al., 2002; Kim et al., 2002) and proline-rich Akt substrate
40 kDa (PRAS40) (Sancak et al., 2007; Thedieck et al., 2007;
Vander Haar et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2007) are specific to
mTORC1, whereas rapamycin-insensitive companion of mTOR
(rictor) (Jacinto et al., 2004; Sarbassov et al., 2004), mammalian
stress-activated map kinase-interacting protein 1 (mSin1) (Frias
et al., 2006; Jacinto et al., 2006), and protein observed with
rictor 1 and 2 (protor1/2) (Pearce et al., 2007; Pearce et al.,
2011; Thedieck et al., 2007) are only part of mTORC2. Figure 1
describes the known molecular functions of the mTOR complex
components and the interaction sites between them (middle and
bottom panels).
As discussed later, the effects of rapamycin on mTOR
signaling are much more complex than originally anticipated
and, surprisingly, almost 20 years after the discovery of mTOR,
our understanding of its mechanism of action is still evolving. It
is clear, however, that rapamycin forms a gain-of-function complex with the intracellular 12-kDa FK506-binding protein
(FKBP12) (Brown et al., 1994; Sabatini et al., 1994). This complex
directly interacts with and inhibits mTOR when it is part of
mTORC1 but not mTORC2. Many mTORC1 functions are highly

Figure 1. mTORC1 and mTORC2 Complexes
The mTOR kinase nucleates two distinct protein complexes termed mTORC1 and mTORC2. mTORC1 responds to amino acids, stress, oxygen, energy, and
growth factors and is acutely sensitive to rapamycin. It promotes cell growth by inducing and inhibiting anabolic and catabolic processes, respectively, and also
drives cell-cycle progression. mTORC2 responds to growth factors and regulates cell survival and metabolism, as well as the cytoskeleton. mTORC2 is
insensitive to acute rapamycin treatment but chronic exposure to the drug can disrupt its structure. The middle panel describes the known functions of the protein
components that make up the mTOR complexes and the bottom panel schematically depicts their interaction sites.

sensitive to rapamycin but exactly how the binding of FKBP12rapamycin to mTORC1 inhibits its activity is unknown. Rapamycin may compromise the structural integrity of mTORC1 (Kim
et al., 2002; Yip et al., 2010) as well as allosterically reduce the
specific activity of its kinase domain (Brown et al., 1995; Brunn
et al., 1997; Burnett et al., 1998).
Upstream Regulators of mTORC1
mTORC1 is the better characterized of the two mTOR complexes and a remarkable feature of this branch of the pathway
is the number and diversity of upstream signals it senses. The
mTORC1 pathway integrates inputs from at least five major intra-

cellular and extracellular cues—growth factors, stress, energy
status, oxygen, and amino acids—to control many major processes, including protein and lipid synthesis and autophagy.
The heterodimer consisting of tuberous sclerosis 1 (TSC1; also
known as hamartin) and TSC2 (also known as tuberin) is a key
upstream regulator of mTORC1 and functions as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for the Ras homolog enriched in brain (Rheb)
GTPase. The GTP-bound form of Rheb directly interacts with
mTORC1 and strongly stimulates its kinase activity. As a Rheb
GAP, TSC1/2 negatively regulates mTORC1 by converting
Rheb into its inactive GDP-bound state (Inoki et al., 2003a; Tee

Figure 2. The mTOR Signaling Pathway
(A) The key signaling nodes that regulate mTORC1 and mTORC2. Critical inputs regulating mTORC1 include growth factors, amino acids, stress, energy status,
and oxygen. When active, mTORC1 promotes protein synthesis, lipogenesis, and energy metabolism and inhibits autophagy and lysosome biogenesis. Alternatively, mTORC2 is activated by growth factors and regulates cytoskeletal organization and cell survival/metabolism. In this figure, the proteins depicted in red
are oncogenes, and the ones in green are tumor suppressors.
(B) The key outputs of the mTORC1 and mTORC2 pathways. mTORC1 regulates a plethora of biological processes through the phosphorylation of several
proteins. S6K1 and 4E-BP1 are by far the best-characterized substrates of mTORC1. mTORC2 regulates survival/metabolism and the cytoskeleton through the
phosphorylation of many AGC kinases including Akt, SGK1, and PKC-a.

et al., 2003). To date, there is no credible evidence that a guanine
nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) exists for Rheb.
TSC1/2 transmits many of the upstream signals that impinge
on mTORC1 (Figure 2A), including growth factors, such as insulin
and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1), that stimulate the PI3K
and Ras pathways. The effector kinases of these pathways—
protein kinase B (Akt/PKB), extracellular-signal-regulated kinase
1/2 (ERK1/2), and ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK1)—directly phosphorylate the TSC1/TSC2 complex to inactivate it and thus
activate mTORC1 (Inoki et al., 2002; Ma et al., 2005; Manning
et al., 2002; Potter et al., 2002; Roux et al., 2004). Akt also signals
to mTORC1 in a TSC1/2-independent fashion by phosphorylating and causing the dissociation from raptor of PRAS40, an
mTORC1 inhibitor (Sancak et al., 2007; Thedieck et al., 2007;
Vander Haar et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2007). Proinflammatory
cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-a (TNFa), activate
mTORC1 through a mechanism conceptually similar to growth
factors: IkB kinase b (IKKb) phosphorylates TSC1, causing
TSC1/2 inhibition (Lee et al., 2007). Lastly, the canonical Wnt
pathway, a major regulator of cell growth, proliferation, polarity,
differentiation, and development, also activates mTORC1
through TSC1/2. In this case, Wnt signaling inhibits glycogen
synthase kinase 3b (GSK3-b), which normally phosphorylates
and promotes TSC2 activity (Inoki et al., 2006).
Like the growth factor inputs to mTORC1, many stresses also
act, at least in part, through TSC1/2, with low energy and oxygen
levels and DNA damage being the best characterized. Adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), in
response to hypoxia or a low energy state, phosphorylates
TSC2 and increases its GAP activity toward Rheb (Inoki et al.,
2003b). Like Akt, AMPK also communicates directly with
mTORC1; it phosphorylates raptor, leading to 14-3-3 binding
and the allosteric inhibition of mTORC1 (Gwinn et al., 2008).
Hypoxia also induces the expression of transcriptional regulation
of DNA damage response 1 (REDD1), which activates TSC2
function in a still poorly understood manner (Brugarolas et al.,
2004; DeYoung et al., 2008; Reiling and Hafen, 2004). DNA
damage also signals to mTORC1 through multiple mechanisms,
all of which require p53-dependent transcription. DNA damage
induces the expression of Tsc2 and phosphatase and tensin
homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (Pten), causing downregulation of the entire PI3K-mTORC1 axis (Feng et al., 2005; Stambolic et al., 2001), and activates AMPK through a mechanism
that depends on the induction of Sestrin1/2 (Budanov and Karin,
2008). Given that so many signals regulate mTORC1 through
TSC1/2, it is surprising that we still do not know how TSC1/2
integrates, at the molecular level, the inputs to control its GAP
activity toward Rheb. Furthermore, it is unclear whether certain
inputs are dominant over others and whether cell type-dependent regulatory mechanisms exist.
Amino acids, particularly leucine and arginine, also activate
mTORC1 and must be present for any upstream signal, including
growth factors, to activate mTORC1 (Blommaart et al., 1995;

Hara et al., 1998). Although it has been known for some time
that amino acids act independently of TSC1/2 (Smith et al.,
2005), the molecular mechanism through which mTORC1
senses intracellular amino acids remains a big mystery in the
mTOR field. In 2008, two groups independently discovered
that amino acid-dependent activation of mTORC1 requires the
Rag GTPases (Kim et al., 2008; Sancak et al., 2008). Mammals
have four Rag proteins, RagA to RagD, which form obligate
heterodimers consisting of RagA or RagB with RagC or RagD
(Figure 2A). The two members of the heterodimer appear to
have opposite nucleotide loading states, so that when RagA/B
is bound to GTP, RagC/D is bound to GDP and vice versa.
Through an unknown mechanism, amino acids promote the
loading of RagA/B with GTP, which enables the heterodimer to
interact with the raptor component of mTORC1 (Sancak et al.,
2008). This interaction results in the translocation of mTORC1
from a poorly characterized cytoplasmic location to the lysosomal surface, where the Rag GTPases dock on a multisubunit
complex called Ragulator (Sancak et al., 2010). Like the Rag
GTPase, Ragulator is essential for the activation of mTORC1
by amino acids.
Why does translocation of mTORC1 to the lysosomal surface
result in its activation? A current model posits that at the lysosomal surface mTORC1 can bind to and become activated by
Rheb, which is found throughout the endomembrane system.
Thus, the Rag and Rheb GTPases are part of a molecular AND
gate: GTP-loaded Rheb only interacts with mTORC1 when the
amino acid-sensitive Rag-Ragulator mechanism brings it onto
the lysosomal surface, ensuring that mTORC1 activation occurs
only if amino acids are available, irrespective of the presence of
other positive signals.
The localization of the Ragulator and Rag GTPases to the lysosomal surface, but not on other endomembranes where Rheb
also resides, suggests an important role for this organelle in
amino acid sensing by mTORC1 pathway. Recent work proposes
an inside-out model of amino acid sensing in which amino acids
accumulate in the lysosomal lumen and initiate signaling through
a mechanism requiring the vacuolar H+-adenoside triphosphate
ATPase (v-ATPase)(Zoncu et al., 2011). Depletion of v-ATPase
subunits blocks amino-acid-induced recruitment of mTORC1 to
the lysosomal surface and downstream signaling. The v-ATPase
directly interacts with the Ragulator, providing a physical link
between the v-ATPase and the Rag GTPase on the surface of
lysosomes (Figure 2A). The ATPase activity of the v-ATPase
and the associated rotation of its V0 section appear to be essential to relay the amino acids signal from the lysosomal lumen to
the Ragulator and Rag GTPases but exactly how the v-ATPase
functions to do so is unknown. Interestingly, the mTORC1
pathway regulates v-ATPase expression, suggesting that a
feedback loop exists between mTORC1 and lysosome function
(Du¨vel et al., 2010; Pen˜a-Llopis et al., 2011).
Over the years a number of other proteins have been
implicated in amino acid sensing by mTORC1, including

mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase kinase (MAP4k3)
(Findlay et al., 2007), mammalian vacuolar protein sorting 34
homolog (hVPS34) (Nobukuni et al., 2005), and inositol polyphosphate monokinase (IPMK) (Kim et al., 2011) and whether
and how these molecules connect to the Rag-Ragulator system
is not known. MAP4k3 is likely upstream of the Rag GTPases
(Yan et al., 2010) but whether it interacts with them is not clear
(Bryk et al., 2010; Yan et al., 2010).
Finally, phosphatidic acid (PA) has also been identified as an
activator of mTORC1 (Fang et al., 2001). Although the role of
PA in regulating mTOR is controversial, several reports show
that exogenous PA or overexpression of PA-producing enzymes
such as phospholipase D1 (PLD1) and PLD2 significantly
increases mTORC1 activity (reviewed in Foster [2009]). PA activates mTOR signaling at least in part by stabilizing the mTOR
complexes (Toschi et al., 2009).
Cellular Processes Downstream of mTORC1
Protein synthesis is by far the best-characterized process
controlled by mTORC1 (Figure 2B). mTORC1 directly phosphorylates the translational regulators eukaryotic translation initiation
factor 4E (eIF4E)-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) and S6 kinase 1
(S6K1), which, in turn, promote protein synthesis (reviewed in
Ma and Blenis [2009]). The phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 prevents
its binding to the cap-binding protein eIF4E, enabling it to participate in the formation of the eIF4F complex that is required for the
initiation of cap-dependent translation. The activation of S6K1
leads, through a variety of effectors, to an increase in mRNA
biogenesis, as well as translational initiation and elongation
(Figure 2B). S6K1 was originally thought to control the translation
of an abundant subclass of mRNAs characterized by an oligopyrimidine tract at the 50 end (50 TOP mRNAs) and that encode
most of the protein components of the translational machinery.
Although mTOR itself is key for the translational control of
50 TOP mRNAs, S6K1 and its substrate ribosomal protein S6
are not required for this process (Tang et al., 2001) and so how
mTORC1 controls the translation of these mRNAs remains
unknown. mTORC1 also upregulates the protein synthesis
machinery in other ways: (1) it activates the regulatory element
tripartite motif-containing protein-24 (TIF-1A), which promotes
its interaction with RNA Polymerase I (Pol I) and the expression
of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) (Mayer et al., 2004); and (2) mTORC1
phosphorylates and inhibits Maf1, a Pol III repressor, and so
induces 5S rRNA and transfer RNA (tRNA) transcription (Kantidakis et al., 2010; Shor et al., 2010). The overall role of mTORC1 in
the regulation of mRNA translation is highly significant because
specific, active-site inhibitors of mTOR that completely inhibit
mTORC1 function, significantly reduce overall rates of protein
synthesis in proliferating cells in culture (Thoreen et al., 2009;
Yu et al., 2009).
In addition to regulating the production of proteins, mTORC1
also controls the synthesis of lipids required for proliferating cells
to generate membranes (reviewed in Laplante and Sabatini
[2009]). To a large extent, mTORC1 acts through the sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1/2 (SREBP1/2) transcription
factors that control the expression of numerous genes involved
in fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis (Figure 2B). The inactive
SREBPs reside on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and their
proteolytic processing in response to insulin or sterol depletion
278 Cell 149, April 13, 2012 ª2012 Elsevier Inc.

releases an active form that travels to the nucleus to activate
transcription. mTORC1 inhibition reduces SREBP1 and 2
expression, impairs their processing, and markedly lowers the
expression of lipogenic genes (Du¨vel et al., 2010; Li et al.,
2010; Porstmann et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2011). mTORC1
appears to regulate SREBP function through several mechanisms, including, at least in some cell types, through S6K1 (Du¨vel
et al., 2010; Li et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2011). In addition,
mTORC1 phosphorylates Lipin-1, preventing it from entering
the nucleus and suppressing SREBP1/2 function and levels
(Peterson et al., 2011). mTORC1 also promotes the expression
and activity of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor g
(PPAR-g), the master regulator of adipogenesis (Kim and
Chen, 2004; Zhang et al., 2009).
Befitting a pathway that when active drives energy consumption, mTORC1 also positively regulates cellular metabolism
and ATP production. mTORC1 increases glycolytic flux by activating the transcription and the translation of hypoxia inducible
factor 1a (HIF1a) (Brugarolas et al., 2003; Du¨vel et al., 2010; Hudson et al., 2002; Laughner et al., 2001), a positive regulator of
many glycolytic genes (Figure 2B). Another study reported that
mTORC1 also increases mitochondrial DNA content and the
expression of genes involved in oxidative metabolism, in part
by mediating the nuclear association between PPAR-g coactivator 1a (PGC1a) and the transcription factor Ying-Yang 1 (YY1),
which positively regulates mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative function (Cunningham et al., 2007). Additional evidence is
needed to support this connection because the YY1 response
element was not identified as a motif enriched in the promoters
of mTORC1-regulated genes (Du¨vel et al., 2010) and little endogenous mTORC1 is found in the nucleus (Sancak et al., 2010;
Sancak et al., 2008; Zoncu et al., 2011).
The discussion so far has focused on the positive effects of
mTORC1 on anabolic processes, but mTORC1 also promotes
growth by negatively regulating autophagy, the central degradative process in cells. Autophagy is required for the recycling of
damaged organelles and for the organismal and cellular adaptation to nutrient starvation. Upon mTORC1 inhibition, autophagosomes form that then engulf cytoplasmic proteins and organelles
and fuse with lysosomes, leading to the degradation of cell
components and the recycling of cellular building blocks. In
mammals, mTORC1 directly phosphorylates and suppresses
ULK1/Atg13/FIP200 (unc-51-like kinase 1/mammalian autophagy-related gene 13/focal adhesion kinase family-interacting
protein of 200 kDa), a kinase complex required to initiate autophagy (Figure 2B) (Ganley et al., 2009; Hosokawa et al., 2009; Jung
et al., 2009). As with the control of protein and lipid synthesis,
mTORC1 is likely to impact autophagy through several mechanisms. For example, mTORC1 regulates death-associated protein 1 (DAP1), a suppressor of autophagy (Koren et al., 2010),
and in a recent analysis of the mTOR-dependent phosphoproteome, WIPI2, a mammalian ortholog of Atg18—a regulator of
early autophagosome formation in yeast—emerged as a potential mTOR effector (Hsu et al., 2011).
In addition to inhibiting autophagy, mTORC1 also negatively
regulates the biogenesis of lysosomes, multifunctional organelles that have the capacity to degrade most cellular components. A recent study indicates that mTORC1 regulates

lysosomes through the transcription factor EB (TFEB), a basic
helix-loop-helix leucine zipper transcription factor that controls
many genes with key roles in lysosomal function (Settembre
et al., 2012). mTORC1 phosphorylates TFEB, which prevents
its nuclear entry, so that starvation-induced mTORC1 inhibition
promotes the nuclear accumulation of TFEB and thus its activity.
Although there is some controversy on exactly how mTORC1
regulates TFEB (Pen˜a-Llopis et al., 2011), there is an increasing
appreciation that mTORC1 is an important regulator of lysosomal adaptation during nutrient deprivation (Yu et al., 2010b).
Interestingly, because TFEB controls the expression of several
genes that promote autophagosome formation and fusion to
lysosomes, it is likely that the mTORC1/TFEB connection also
plays a significant role in promoting autophagy when nutrient
levels are low (Settembre et al., 2011).
It is sometimes joked that "mTOR regulates everything" and
although this is, of course, not true, it is remarkable how many
major processes the pathway does control. This perhaps is not
so surprising considering that mTOR is one of the key sensors
of nutritional status at the cellular and organismal levels, and it
is not hard to imagine why it is beneficial for many processes
to be linked to the nutritional state.
The mTORC2 Signaling Network
Because acute treatment with rapamycin does not perturb
mTORC2 signaling and FKBP12-rapamycin cannot bind to intact
mTORC2, this complex was originally thought to be rapamycin
insensitive (Jacinto et al., 2004; Sarbassov et al., 2004). However, the situation turns out to be much more complex as long
term treatment with rapamycin reduces mTORC2 signaling in
some, but not all, cell types and does so by suppressing
mTORC2 assembly (Phung et al., 2006; Sarbassov et al.,
2006). Why there is cell type specificity to the rapamycin sensitivity of mTORC2 assembly is still unclear.
Compared to mTORC1, much less is known about the
mTORC2 pathway. mTORC2 signaling is insensitive to nutrients
but does respond to growth factors such as insulin through
a poorly defined mechanism(s) that requires PI3K. One potential
mechanism involves a new role for ribosomes, as ribosomes are
needed for mTORC2 activation and mTORC2 binds them in
a PI3K-dependent fashion (Zinzalla et al., 2011).
mTORC2 controls several members of the AGC subfamily
of kinases including Akt, serum- and glucocorticoid-induced
protein kinase 1 (SGK1), and protein kinase C-a (PKC-a) (Figure 2B). Akt regulates cellular processes such as metabolism,
survival, apoptosis, growth, and proliferation through the
phosphorylation of several effectors. mTORC2 directly activates
Akt by phosphorylating its hydrophobic motif (Ser473), a site
required for its maximal activation (Sarbassov et al., 2005).
Defective Akt-Ser473 phosphorylation associated with mTORC2
depletion impairs the phosphorylation of some Akt targets,
including forkhead box O1/3a (FoxO1/3a), whereas other Akt
targets such as TSC2 and GSK3-b remain unaffected (Guertin
et al., 2006; Jacinto et al., 2006). The fact that Akt activity is
not completely abolished in cells lacking mTORC2 probably
explains these results. mTORC2 also directly activates SGK1,
a kinase controlling ion transport and growth (Garcı´a-Martı´nez
and Alessi, 2008). In contrast to Akt, SGK-1 activity is completely

blocked by the loss of mTORC2. Because SGK1 controls
FoxO1/3a phosphorylation on residues also phosphorylated by
Akt, loss of SGK1 activity is probably responsible for the reduction in FoxO1/3a phosphorylation in mTORC2-depleted cells.
PKC-a is the third AGC kinase activated by mTORC2. Along
with other effectors, such as paxilin and Rho GTPases, the
activation of PKC-a by mTORC2 regulates cell shape in celltype-specific fashion by affecting the actin cytoskeleton (Jacinto
et al., 2004; Sarbassov et al., 2004) (Figure 2B).
mTOR Signaling in Cancer
Several observations support the importance of mTOR pathway
in cancer pathogenesis. Many components of the PI3K signaling
pathway, which is upstream of both mTORC1 and mTORC2, are
mutated in human cancers (Figure 2A). Additionally, the loss of
p53, a very common event in cancer, promotes mTORC1 activation (Feng et al., 2005). In addition, several familial cancer
syndromes arise from mutations in genes encoding proteins
that lie upstream of the mTOR complexes, including Tsc1/2,
serine threonine kinase 11 (Lkb1), Pten, and neurofibromatosis
type 1 (Nf1) (Figure 2). Oncogenic activation of mTOR signaling
induces several processes required for cancer cell growth,
survival, and proliferation (Figure 3A).
A growing body of evidence points to the deregulation
of protein synthesis downstream of mTORC1 at the level of
4E-BP1/eIF4E as playing a central role in tumor formation.
Loss of 4EBP1/2 and the concomitant activation of cap-dependent translation promotes cell-cycle progression and cell
proliferation in culture (Dowling et al., 2010). 4E-BP1/eIF4E
also mediates the effects of oncogenic Akt signaling on mRNA
translation, cell growth, and tumor progression (Hsieh et al.,
2010). Interestingly, the contribution of S6K1 and S6 to the oncogenic action of ERK and/or Akt appears limited, indicating that
the signaling branches controlling protein synthesis downstream
of mTORC1 are not equally required in oncogenesis (Hsieh et al.,
2010; She et al., 2010). Exactly how the mTORC1/4E-BP1/eIf4E
axis contributes to cancer is unclear. It is thought that eiF4E
affects cell proliferation and tumorigenesis by promoting the
translation of specific mRNAs coding for pro-oncogenic proteins
regulating cell survival, cell-cycle progression, angiogenesis,
energy metabolism, and metastasis. Additionally, the increase
in ribosome biogenesis linked to mTOR activation probably
promotes cell proliferation by providing the machinery required
to sustain high levels of cell growth.
An increase in de novo lipid synthesis is a hallmark of proliferating cancer cells (reviewed in Menendez and Lupu [2007]) and
such cells must produce fatty acids to synthesize membranes.
PI3K signaling promotes the activation of the prolipogenic factor
SREBP1, and mTORC1 is required to relay oncogenic and
growth factor signaling to SREBP1 (Du¨vel et al., 2010). SREBP1
also drives the expression of components of the oxidative
branch of the pentose phosphate pathway, which controls the
production of the reducing equivalents and ribose-5-phosphate
needed for lipogenesis and nucleotide biosynthesis, respectively
(Figure 3A) (Du¨vel et al., 2010). The inhibition of cell proliferation
associated with SREBP1/2 depletion in Tsc2 null cells indicates
that mTORC1-driven cell proliferation requires the transcriptional program controlled by SREBP1/2.

The constitutive activation of PI3K-mTORC1 signaling in
cancer cells strongly inhibits autophagy. How such impairment
of autophagy affects cancer is unclear. Autophagy is a doubleedged sword in tumorigenesis, acting both as a tumor suppressor and a protector of cancer cell survival. Mice deficient
for essential components of the autophagy machinery have
accelerated rates of spontaneous tumor development (reviewed
in Yang and Klionsky [2010]). Autophagy-defective cells accumulate protein aggregates, damaged mitochondria, and reactive
oxygen species, which are believed to promote DNA damage
and tumorigenesis. Conversely, several lines of evidence
indicate that repressing autophagy may impair tumorigenesis
by reducing the ability of cancer cells to survive in nutrient and
energy poor conditions. For instance, Tsc2 and Lkb1 null cells
are hypersensitive to energy deprivation-induced apoptosis
(Inoki et al., 2003b; Shaw et al., 2004). The role of autophagy in
mediating the effect of mTORC1 activation on cancer is probably
context specific, autophagy being important to prevent cancer
initially but being required to protect cells when the tumor is
established.
There is also emerging evidence for a role for mTORC2
in cancer. Many gliomas overexpress the mTORC2 subunit
rictor, and its forced overexpression promotes mTORC2
assembly and activity and endows cancer cells with increased
proliferative and invasion potential (Hietakangas and Cohen,
2008; Masri et al., 2007). In mice, the development of prostate
cancer induced by the loss of the tumor suppressor PTEN
requires mTORC2 function (Guertin et al., 2009). These results
support an important role of mTORC2 in promoting tumorigenesis and suggest that strategies aimed to reduce the activity of
this complex could have roles as anticancer therapies. Currently,
however, there is no pharmacological way to inhibit mTORC2
without also affecting mTORC1, and the fact that both complexes share the same catalytic domain makes the prospect of
developing an mTORC2-specific inhibitor daunting.
Targeting mTOR Signaling for Cancer Therapy
The evidence linking activated mTOR signaling to cancer has
generated significant interest in targeting the pathway for cancer
therapy and many rapamycin analogs (rapalogs) are now being
tested in clinic. In 2007, the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) approved the rapalog Temsirolimus for the treatment of
advanced-stage renal cell carcinoma, making it the first mTOR
inhibitor approved for cancer therapy. Recently, the rapalog
Everolimus was approved for the treatment of Tuberous Scle-

rosis Complex, a relatively rare genetic disease, caused by mutations in Tsc1/2, in which patients develop nonmalignant tumors in
many organs, including the brain. There are an important number
of clinical trials underway using rapalogs, which have shown
promise in several malignancies that are often refractory to standard chemotherapies (reviewed in Wander et al. [2011]).
Although rapalogs have had some success in the clinic, they
have shown only modest efficacy in tumors where they were
expected to provide important benefits. Substantial work in
preclinical models of cancer suggested that loss of PTEN or
Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) might represent biomarkers of rapalog
sensitivity (Neshat et al., 2001; Thomas et al., 2006). Unfortunately, in the clinical setting the situation has clearly turned out
to be more complex so that the identification of biomarkers
that predict which tumors will respond to rapamycin-like molecules remains an unmet goal.
The presence of numerous negative feedback loops in the
mTOR pathway may contribute to limit the therapeutic efficacy
of rapalogs (Figure 3B). When activated by mTORC1, S6K1
directly phosphorylates the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS1),
which promotes IRS1 degradation and reduces the ability of
growth factors to signal downstream of receptor tyrosine kinase
(RTK) (Harrington et al., 2004; Um et al., 2004) (Figure 3C). Additionally, mTORC1 negatively regulates growth factor signaling by
directly phosphorylating IRS1 (Tzatsos and Kandror, 2006) and
the RTK inhibitor growth factor receptor-bound protein 10
(Grb10) (Hsu et al., 2011; Yu et al., 2011) as well as by reducing
the expression of the platelet-derived growth factor receptors
(PDGFRs) through an unknown mechanism (Zhang et al.,
2007). Although our understanding of the feedback loops from
mTORC1 to RTK signaling has progressed, it is important to
point out that formal evidence is missing showing that the activation of feedback signaling by rapamycin and its derivates limits
the therapeutic potential of these molecules.
Another more likely reason why rapamycin may have limited
efficacy in cancer treatment is the increasing realization that
rapamycin only partially inhibits the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1
(Chresta et al., 2010; Feldman et al., 2009; Garcı´a-Martı´nez
et al., 2009; Thoreen et al., 2009; Yu et al., 2009). As discussed
above, the 4E-BP1/eIf4E axis plays an important role in cancer
by controlling translation of various transcripts that promote
cell proliferation and tumorigenesis.
With the rationale that the inhibition of both mTORC1 and
mTORC2 would have a greater impact on cancer cells, several

Because the rapalogs only partially inhibit 4E-BP1 phosphorylation, their impact on eiF4E-mediated protein translation is limited.
(D) By completely blocking mTORC1, mTOR kinase inhibitors strongly inhibit the 4E-BP1/eIF4E axis and protein synthesis. Additionally, mTOR kinase inhibitors
can affect cell survival and proliferation by blocking mTORC2-mediated Akt phosphorylation. The elevation in RTK-PI3K-PDK1 activity in response to mTOR
kinase inhibitors can potentially reactivate Akt phosphorylation on Thr308, which may be sufficient to drive cell survival.

groups have developed small molecules that directly inhibit
mTOR kinase activity (Chresta et al., 2010; Feldman et al.,
2009; Garcı´a-Martı´nez et al., 2009; Thoreen et al., 2009; Yu
et al., 2009). These molecules, which function as ATP-competitive inhibitors of mTOR, block the phosphorylation of all
known downstream targets of mTORC1 and mTORC2. As anticipated, these inhibitors do impair cell growth and proliferation
in vitro and tumor growth in vivo to a much greater degree
than rapamycin (Falcon et al., 2011; Feldman et al., 2009; Garcı´a-Martı´nez et al., 2009; Janes et al., 2010; Thoreen et al.,
2009; Yu et al., 2010a; Yu et al., 2009). It was originally thought
that the inhibition of the mTORC2-Akt axis by mTOR kinase
inhibitors would represent the main reason why these compounds are more efficient than rapamycin in blocking cell growth
and proliferation. Surprisingly, however, even in mTORC2-deficient cells these inhibitors cause a greater reduction in proliferation than rapamycin (Feldman et al., 2009; Thoreen et al., 2009).
This led to the realization that mTOR kinase inhibitors exert
their antiproliferative effects primarily through suppression of
rapamycin-resistant functions of mTORC1. Unlike rapamycin,
these inhibitors completely block 4E-BP1 phosphorylation,
which results in a stronger inhibition of cap-dependent translation (Figure 3D). Moreover, mTOR kinase inhibitors induce
a significantly broader transcriptional response compared with
rapamycin; many genes with roles in tumor biology and metabolism are only affected by complete mTOR inhibition (Wang
et al., 2011).
Although these results support the importance of mTORC1
inhibition in mediating the effects of mTOR kinase inhibitors on
cancer, this does not mean that mTORC2 is not playing a role.
In addition to its role on regulating cell survival downstream of
Akt and SGK1, mTORC2 has also been shown to positively
control vascular system formation (Guertin et al., 2006) and
chemotaxism (Liu et al., 2010). This raises the possibility that
mTORC2 inhibition could impair tumor formation and maintenance by blocking angiogenesis or by reducing the recruitment
of immune cells to the tumors. In vivo work is needed to verify
these hypotheses.
It is important to point out that the efficiency of mTOR kinase
inhibitors, like that of rapamycin, may also be impaired by the
activation of feedback loops. The elevation of RTK-PI3K-PDK1
(phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1) activity in response to
mTOR kinase inhibitors can promote Akt phosphorylation on
Thr308, which may be sufficient to drive cell survival (Peterson
et al., 2009). Ongoing clinical trials with mTOR kinase inhibitors
will help to determine to what extent these feedback loops can
impact the therapeutic potential of these molecules.
The similarity between the catalytic domains of mTOR and
class I PI3K has also enabled the development of compounds
that simultaneously inhibit both kinases. These molecules, which
inhibit mTORC1, mTORC2, and PI3K, decrease the phosphorylation of Akt, S6K1, and 4E-BP1, and may be attractive molecules to target cancers driven by PI3K activation (Figure 3E)
(Brachmann et al., 2009). Some studies indicate that such broad
inhibition of cellular signaling may hurt normal cells, thus limiting
the therapeutic window of these compounds (Janes et al., 2010).
Nonetheless, phase I clinical trials with the dual PI3K/mTOR
inhibitor NVP-BEZ235 (Novartis) or XL-765 (Exelixis) show prom282 Cell 149, April 13, 2012 ª2012 Elsevier Inc.

ising efficiency in patients with various types of tumors (reviewed
in Vilar et al. [2011]).
mTOR Signaling in Tissues and Its Role in Metabolic
Disease
In mammals, the transition between the fasting and fed states
affects the circulating amounts of nutrients and growth factors.
In turn, these changes determine whether tissues orient
their metabolism toward anabolic or catabolic processes. For
example, high levels of nutrients and growth factors drive
glycogen synthesis in muscle and liver and lipid uptake in
adipose tissue, while reducing protein breakdown in muscle,
gluconeogenesis in the liver, and lipolysis in adipose tissue.
Because the mTOR pathway responds to nutrients and growth
factors levels, its role in regulating metabolism has been of
intense interest during the last few years.
An understanding of the role of mTOR in regulating metabolism
in vivo has been limited by the fact that whole-body inactivation in
mice of key components of the pathway causes embryonic
lethality (Gangloff et al., 2004; Guertin et al., 2006; Jacinto et al.,
2006; Murakami et al., 2004; Shiota et al., 2006; Yang et al.,
2006). The use of conditional null alleles of genes encoding
mTOR pathway components has started to reveal new functions
of this pathway in controlling metabolism in various tissues. The
following section reviews current knowledge linking mTOR to
tissue metabolism by focusing on the role of the pathway in the
development of metabolic diseases such as obesity, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes.
Brain: Regulation of Energy Balance
The hypothalamus is an important region of the brain that
integrates signals from circulating nutrients (glucose, amino
acids, and lipids) and hormones (leptin and insulin) to control
energy balance. In particular, the arcuate nucleus (ARC) of the
hypothalamus is a key node in the complex network that controls
energy balance and affects the development of obesity.
mTORC1 is active in the ARC and intracerebroventricular administration of leucine or leptin to rats promotes mTORC1 activity
and reduces food intake in a rapamycin-sensitive fashion (Cota
et al., 2006) (Figure 4A). Some studies indicate that mTORC1
reduces food intake at least by reducing the expression of the
orexigenic neuropeptide Y (NPY) and agouti-related peptide
(AgRP) in the hypothalamus through an unclear mechanism
that involves S6K1 (Blouet et al., 2008; Cota et al., 2008).
Together, these results highlight the importance of hypothalamic
mTORC1 signaling axis for the central regulation of energy
balance by nutrients and hormones.
High-fat feeding and obesity impair the central anorectic action
of insulin and leptin (reviewed in Cota [2009]). Interestingly, highfat feeding blocks the ability of leptin to activate hypothalamic
mTORC1 and to reduce food intake (Figure 4A) (Cota et al.,
2008). This finding supports the possibility that deregulation in
mTORC1 signaling could play a role in the development of obesity
by favoring resistance to anorectic signals and by promoting
hyperphagia following exposure to a high-fat diet. Another interesting possibility is that genetic predispositions affecting the
activity of mTORC1 in the hypothalamus could directly favor
obesity or leanness by modulating the control of energy balance.
Whether such predispositions exist is unknown.

Figure 4. mTOR Signaling and Metabolism
The roles of mTOR signaling in the regulation of tissue metabolism in the normal (left side) or obese/nutrient overload state (right side).
(A) In the hypothalamus, mTORC1 activation reduces the expression of orexigenic peptides (NPY and AgRP) through an unclear mechanism that involves S6K1.
High-fat diets reduce the ability of leptin and insulin to promote mTORC1 activity and reduce food intake.
(B) In adipose tissue, mTORC1 activation promotes adipogenesis by activating PPAR-g. mTORC2-Akt activation reduces lipolysis and promote glucose uptake.
High circulating nutrients and cytokines promote mTORC1 activity in obesity, which inhibits insulin signaling and causes insulin resistance (IR) through various
mechanisms.
(C) In muscles, mTORC1 plays crucial role in regulating protein synthesis, mitochondrial biogenesis, and oxidative metabolism. Muscle contractions increase
mTORC1 activity. mTORC2-Akt activation induces glucose uptake and blocks protein catabolism. Similar to adipose tissue, the elevation of mTORC1 activity by
obesity and nutrient overload blocks insulin signaling. The reduction in mTORC2-Akt action promotes protein catabolism and reduces glucose uptake,
contributing to muscle mass loss and systemic IR.
(D) In the liver, mTORC1 activation reduces ketone body production by inhibiting PPAR-a activity. mTORC1 also promotes hepatic lipogenesis by activating
SREBP1. Alternatively, mTORC2-Akt blocks FoxO1 activity and the activation of gluconeogenesis. Liver mTORC1 activity is elevated in obesity and overfeeding,
which promotes hepatic IR, gluconeogenesis, and lipogenesis.
(E) In the pancreas, mTORC1 regulates b-cell mass by promoting b-cell growth and proliferation. mTORC1 is also important for insulin production and secretion.
The mTORC2-Akt axis positively affects b-cell mass by promoting proliferation and survival. Obesity and nutrient overload drives mTORC1 activity in b-cells.
Sustained activation of mTORC1 ultimately cause b-cell apoptosis by inhibiting Akt signaling. The loss of b-cells favors progression toward diabetes.

Adipose: Regulation of Adipogenesis and Lipogenesis
mTOR signaling plays a fundamental role in adipogenesis (reviewed in Laplante and Sabatini [2009]), the process that leads
to the formation of adipose tissue, the most important energystorage site in mammals. In vitro, the inhibition of mTORC1
blocks adipogenesis and impairs the maintenance of fat cells
(Gagnon et al., 2001; Kim and Chen, 2004; Polak et al., 2008),
whereas overactivation of mTORC1 promotes adipogenesis
(Zhang et al., 2009). As with much of mTORC1 biology, there
are likely many downstream effectors involved in the control of
adipogenesis. S6K1 regulates the commitment of embryonic
stem cell to adipogenic progenitors by regulating the expression
of early adipogenic transcription factors (Figure 4B)(Carnevalli
et al., 2010), and the 4E-BPs control the terminal differentiation
of adipocytes through the translational control of the master
regulator of adipogenesis, PPAR-g (Carnevalli et al., 2010; Le
Bacquer et al., 2007).
Mice with adipose-specific loss of the mTORC1 are lean and
resistant to high-fat-diet-induced obesity (Polak et al., 2008)
and have smaller and fewer adipocytes. On the other hand,
mice with adipose-specific loss of mTORC2 have normal fat
mass (Kumar et al., 2010) but a defect in adipose tissue Akt
phosphorylation that translates into an increase in lipolysis and
circulating free fatty acids (FFA).
The expansion of adipose tissue that characterizes the obese
state represents the main risk factor for the development of
insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, and mTORC1 is highly
active in the tissues of obese and high-fat-fed rodents (Khamzina
et al., 2005; Tremblay et al., 2007; Um et al., 2004). Elevated
circulating levels of insulin, proinflammatory cytokines, and nutrients (branch-chain amino acids and glucose), represent driving
forces that probably promote mTORC1 activity in obese animals
(Figures 2 and 4B). In addition to directly contributing to adipose
tissue expansion through the activation of adipogenic/lipogenic
factors, mTORC1 promotes insulin resistance in adipose tissue
through the S6K1-mediated inhibition of insulin signaling (Um
et al., 2004). The reduction in the action of insulin in adipose
tissue probably exacerbates systemic insulin resistance by
promoting FFA release by adipocytes, ectopic fat deposition,
and lipotoxicity (reviewed in Cusi [2010]).
The high rate of protein synthesis associated with mTORC1
activation may also induce insulin resistance by promoting ER
stress and the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Ozcan et al.,
2008). ER stress is a condition that prevails in enlarged
adipocytes where it impairs insulin signaling through the destabilization of IRS1 by c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) (reviewed in
Hotamisligil [2010]). To what extend mTORC1 activation in the
adipose tissue of obese individuals promotes ER stress and
insulin resistance remains to be determined.
Regulation of Muscle Mass, Oxidative Metabolism,
and Glucose Homeostasis
In addition to responding to many of the same upstream signals
described earlier, in muscle, mTORC1 also senses, through
unknown mechanisms, mechanical contraction, which stimulates protein synthesis to drive muscle hypertrophy (reviewed
in Philp et al. [2011]) (Figure 4C). In mice, muscle-specific loss
of mTORC1 reduces muscle mass and oxidative function and
leads to early death (Bentzinger et al., 2008). In such mice, the
284 Cell 149, April 13, 2012 ª2012 Elsevier Inc.

expression of the mitochondrial transcriptional regulator
PGC1-a decreases, which correlates with a reduction in oxidative metabolism. Previous work also points to a connection
between mTORC1 and PGC1-a as rapamycin inhibits the complex of PGC1-a with YY1 (Cunningham et al., 2007). Loss of
mTORC1 in muscle also reduces the intensity of the negative
feedback loop to IRS1, which increases Akt activation and promotes glycogen accumulation in muscles. On the other hand,
mTORC2 inhibition in muscle in vivo has no structural impact
(Bentzinger et al., 2008; Kumar et al., 2008) but does cause
a reduction in glucose uptake and thus mild systemic glucose
intolerance.
Skeletal muscle is the major site of glucose disposal in
response to food intake and insulin, and an impairment of
glucose uptake in this tissue contributes to type 2 diabetes.
The high activation of mTORC1 in the muscle of obese and
high-fat-fed rodents drives S6K1-mediated feedback inhibition
of insulin signaling, which reduces glucose uptake by the muscle
and contributes to systemic insulin resistance (Figure 4C)
(Khamzina et al., 2005; Um et al., 2004). Beyond its impact on
glucose homeostasis, impaired insulin signaling in muscle may
also contribute to the muscle loss observed in obesity and insulin
resistance by promoting protein catabolism through the expression of ubiquitin ligases by FoxO1 (Wang et al., 2006). Such
stimulation of protein catabolism could explain why high
mTORC1 activity in the muscles of obese humans and mice
does not translate into increased muscle mass. Strangely,
high-fat feeding, obesity, and type 2 diabetes, which are conditions associated with elevated mTORC1 activation, all impair
mitochondrial biogenesis and function in muscles (Mootha
et al., 2003; Patti et al., 2003; Sparks et al., 2005). The reason
for this paradox is unknown but highlights the fact that mitochondrial biogenesis and function is not solely controlled by mTORC1
and that other signaling pathways certainly play important roles.
Liver: Regulation of Ketogenesis and Lipogenesis
The liver plays a central role in controlling glucose and lipid
homeostasis in response to fasting and feeding. mTORC1
controls the hepatic production of the ketone bodies that peripheral tissues use as energy sources during fasting (Sengupta
et al., 2010). mTORC1 activity is low during fasting and mice
with constitutive activation of mTORC1 in the liver are unable
to induce ketogenesis when fasted. mTORC1 impairs the activity
of PPAR-a, the master transcriptional regulator of ketogenic
genes, by promoting the nuclear accumulation of nuclear
receptor corepressor 1 (NcoR1) (Figure 4D). In addition to its
role in controlling the hepatic response to fasting, mTORC1
also promotes anabolism in the fed state by controlling hepatic
lipogenesis through the regulation of SREBP1c (Li et al., 2010;
Yecies et al., 2011).
As in muscle and adipose tissue, mTORC1/S6K1 activity is
high in the livers of obese rodents, which leads to the degradation of IRS1 and hepatic insulin resistance (Khamzina et al.,
2005; Tremblay et al., 2007). The impairment of PI3K-Akt
signaling in the liver promotes gluconeogenesis and contributes
to the hyperglycemia and the hyperinsulinemia observed in
insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Obesity is the major risk
factor in the development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, a
condition which is produced by fat accumulation in the liver

Figure 5. Rapamycin and the Treatment of Metabolic Diseases
(A) Overview of the impact of rapamycin on organ and systemic metabolism.
Rapamycin induces a diabetes-like syndrome by impairing the function of the
muscles, liver, adipose tissue, and pancreatic b-cells. The downregulated
processes are in red and those upregulated in green.
(B) Illustration of the hypothesized relation between mTORC1 activation and
insulin sensitivity and metabolic profile in vivo. The relation between mTORC1
activity and insulin sensitivity and metabolic profile probably follows a

impact on systemic metabolism.

and which can lead to serious complications including cirrhosis
and hepatocellular carcinoma. The accumulation of triglycerides
in the liver of obese humans is associated with the promotion of
lipogenesis in hepatocytes (Donnelly et al., 2005). Although
highly dependent on insulin for its activation, lipogenesis is paradoxically very active in the liver of insulin resistant rodents. Sustained activation of mTORC1 in response to high circulating
levels of nutrients and proinflammatory cytokines is likely to
exacerbate lipogenesis through the activation of SREBP1.
Consistent with this idea, liver-specific deletion of mTORC1
significantly impairs SREBP1 function and makes mice resistant
to the hepatic steatosis and hypercholesterolemia induced by
a Western diet (Peterson et al., 2011). Thus, elevated hepatic
mTORC1 could explain why lipogenesis remains active, whereas

the suppression of glucose production becomes insulin resistant
in the liver of obese and insulin resistant mice and humans
(reviewed in Brown and Goldstein [2008]) (Figure 4D).
Pancreas: Regulation of b-Cell Mass, Insulin Secretion,
and Glucose Homeostasis
The b-cells of the pancreas secrete insulin in response to nutrients and are essential in regulating glucose homeostasis. The
fact that mTORC1 signaling controls growth in response to
nutrients has generated interest in the potential role of this
signaling node in the regulation of b-cell mass and function. In
mice, constitutive activation of mTORC1 in b-cells causes a
decrease in blood glucose, hyperinsulinemia, and improves
glucose tolerance (Rachdi et al., 2008; Shigeyama et al., 2008).
This phenotype is associated with an increase in b-cell size
and number and can be reverted by rapamycin, indicating that
mTORC1 is a key positive regulator of b-cell function and mass
(Figure 4E). S6K1 appears to mediate some of the effects of
mTORC1, as mice with loss of S6K1 have small b-cells and are
glucose intolerant, hypoinsulinemic, and have impaired insulin
secretion (Pende et al., 2000). Loss of mTORC2 in b-cells is
linked to the reduction in Akt activity and to the activation of
FoxO1 and causes mild hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance
due to a reduction in b-cell mass, proliferation, and insulin
production and secretion (Gu et al., 2011).
Peripheral insulin resistance and nutrient excess increase the
pressure on pancreatic b-cells for the production of more insulin.
The high demand for insulin induces b-cell hypertrophy and
proliferation and increases the formation of new b-cells from
progenitors, which culminates in the elevation of insulin production and secretion. This process is known as b-cell compensation. The chronic pressure on b-cells can ultimately lead to their
exhaustion and the development of type 2 diabetes. mTORC1
activity is elevated in the b-cells of genetically obese or highfat-fed mice (Shigeyama et al., 2008). mTORC1 acts as a double
edge sword in the regulation of b-cell mass and function in
response to nutrient overload and insulin resistance (Figure 4E).
Although mTORC1 positively regulates b-cell mass and insulin
secretion, sustained activation of mTORC1/S6K1 signaling
exacerbates insulin resistance in islets through the feedback
inhibition of IRS1 and IRS2, which reduces cell survival and
promotes apoptosis (Elghazi et al., 2010; Shigeyama et al.,
2008). In support of this model, mice with constitutive activation
of mTORC1 in b-cells have increased b-cells mass in the first
phase of their life but upon aging become hyperglycemic and hypoinsulinemic due to the loss of b-cells (Shigeyama et al., 2008).
mTOR Inhibitors in the Treatment of Metabolic Diseases
Because the chronic activation of mTORC1 in the tissues of
obese mice and humans appears to play a role in the development of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, the potential of
rapamycin to improve metabolic parameters has been tested
in a variety of animal models. Unexpectedly, treatment of rodents with rapamycin leads to a profound deterioration of the
metabolic profile. Rapamycin reduces adipose tissue size and
b-cell mass and function and causes hyperlipidemia, severe
insulin resistance, and glucose intolerance and promotes
hepatic gluconeogenesis (Aggarwal et al., 2006; Cunningham
et al., 2007; Fraenkel et al., 2008; Houde et al., 2010) (Figure 5A).
An impaired metabolic profile has also been observed in humans

chronically treated with rapamycin (reviewed in Stallone et al.
[2009]). Many reasons could explain the inefficiency of rapamycin to improve insulin sensitivity and glucose and lipid homeostasis in vivo. First, the chronic inhibition of mTORC1 modulates
many key processes (i.e., protein synthesis, autophagy, and
mitochondrial function and biogenesis) that are likely required
for the maintenance of tissue functions. In this context, any positive effect associated with the reduction in the negative feedback
loop from mTORC1/S6K1 to IRS may be lost due to systemic
metabolic dysregulation. A new study also indicates that chronic
rapamycin treatment impairs whole-body insulin sensitivity at
least by disrupting the integrity of mTORC2 and by blocking
the ability of mTORC2-Akt to inhibit hepatic gluconeogenesis
(Lamming et al., 2012). Although the use of rapamycin in vivo
worsens systemic metabolism, it is reasonable to think that
suboptimal doses of rapamycin could improve metabolism in
the context of obesity by normalizing, but not completely inhibiting, mTORC1 (Figure 5B). This strategy could also limit the
inhibition of mTORC2-Akt caused by high doses of rapamycin.
Following the same rational, it is possible that the antidiabetic
drug metformin, which is known to negatively regulate the action
of mTORC1, might improve metabolic profile by partially inhibiting mTORC1 signaling. Finally, inhibition of S6K1 downstream of
mTORC1 could represent another interesting approach to
improve insulin sensitivity without too many side effects. The
recent availability of a new specific S6K1 inhibitor could be
used to test this possibility (Pearce et al., 2010).
The chronic effect of mTOR kinase inhibitors on tissue metabolism and glucose and lipid homeostasis has not been extensively tested so far. One study reported an elevation in blood
glucose in mice treated with the mTOR kinase inhibitor
AZD8055 (Chresta et al., 2010), suggesting that these inhibitors
may also impair metabolism. The negative impact mTOR kinase
inhibitors on systemic metabolism is expected considering that
these molecules are much better than rapamycin at blocking
mTOR and Akt signaling.
Implication of mTOR Signaling in Neurodegeneration
Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson disease,
Alzheimer disease, Huntington disease, amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis, and frontotemporal dementia, are all associated with
permanent loss of neuronal structure and functions. Genetic
predispositions and aging represent the main risk factors for
these diseases and a key pathological hallmark shared by
many of them is the accumulation of toxic protein aggregates,
also known as inclusions. The inability of neurons to clear mutant
and/or misfolded proteins leads to their aggregation and to the
cellular damage that ultimately causes cell death.
Many lines of evidence now suggest that intracellular protein
degradation pathways such as autophagy and the ubiquitin-proteasome system are deregulated in neurodegenerative diseases
and may play key roles in the etiology of these pathologies (reviewed in Rubinsztein [2006]). Because mTORC1 signaling is
recognized as the most important regulator of autophagy, its
implication in neurodegenerative diseases has been intensively
investigated over the last decade. Autophagy serves as a major
degradation pathway for the clearance of various aggregateprone proteins, and defects in the activation of autophagy are

common to many neurodegenerative disorders. Additionally,
deletion of the essential autophagy gene Atg5 or Atg7 in the
central nervous system of mice promotes the accumulation of
polyubiquitinated proteins and neurodegeneration, even in the
absence of any disease-associated mutant proteins (Hara
et al., 2006; Komatsu et al., 2006). These last observations
support the notion that autophagy is essential for the survival
of neural cells and that an impairment of autophagy is implicated
in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders. Interestingly, inhibition of mTORC1 with rapamycin promotes the autophagic degradation of aggregate-prone proteins in vitro and
reduces the severity of neurodegeneration in several in vivo
models (reviewed in Sarkar and Rubinsztein [2008]). Interestingly, rapamycin also reduces the aggregation of misfolded
proteins by slowing protein synthesis, suggesting that other
downstream effectors of mTORC1 signaling may play roles in
the development of these pathologies (King et al., 2008).
In this context, the emergence of the new generation of mTOR
kinase inhibitors is very exciting, as these new tools will help to
clarify the role of mTOR signaling in neurodegeneration. Considering that mTOR kinase inhibitors are more efficient than the first
generation of rapalogs in promoting autophagy (Thoreen et al.,
2009) and blocking protein synthesis (Thoreen et al., 2009; Yu
et al., 2009), it is reasonable to believe that these molecules
could be even more efficient in treating diseases associated
with the formation and accumulation of protein aggregates.
From a systemic point of view, the use of mTOR kinase inhibitors
over a long period of time could damage tissue and impair
metabolism, as discussed in the previous section. The development of small molecules that selectively modulate the activity
of proteins controlling autophagy downstream of mTORC1
represents a possible avenue to induce this process in a more
specific fashion.
Implication of mTOR Signaling in the Aging Process
Aging is the main risk factor for the development of various
diseases including cancers, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular
and neurodegenerative diseases. Understanding the mechanisms regulating aging may help to delay the development of
these pathologies and could ultimately extend human healthspan.
Dietary restriction (DR) is one of the most robust environmental
manipulations to extend lifespan in various species (reviewed in
Kapahi et al. [2010]). Because TOR signaling controls cellular
responses to nutrient availability, many groups have tested the
possibility that this pathway could be an important player in
the regulation of life span. Numerous reports indicate that inhibition of TOR activity induces life extension in yeast (Kaeberlein
et al., 2005; Medvedik et al., 2007), worms (Vellai et al., 2003),
and flies (Bjedov et al., 2010; Kapahi et al., 2004). In yeast, DR
does not further extend the lifespan in absence of the gene
TOR1, one of the two TOR genes in yeast, suggesting that
TOR inhibition and DR promote lifespan via a common mechanism (Kaeberlein et al., 2005). A similar effect has been seen in
Caenorhabditis elegans, where dsRNA against TOR does not
extend the lifespan of eat-2 mutant worms, which have impaired
feeding behavior and represent a genetic model for DR (Hansen
et al., 2008). However, rapamycin treatment does slightly extend

Figure 6. mTORC1 and Aging
The activation of mTORC1 by growth factors and nutrients inhibits autophagy and promotes protein synthesis. Over time, this may promote cellular stress (protein
aggregation, organelle dysfunction, and oxidative stress), which might lead to damage accumulation and a reduction in cell function and thus promote the
development of aging-related diseases. Also, mTORC1 activation induces stem cell exhaustion, which reduces tissue repair and promotes tissue dysfunction.
Dietary restriction and rapamycin may delay aging and increase longevity by regulating these processes downstream of mTORC1.

the lifespan of flies subject to DR (Bjedov et al., 2010). Furthermore, inhibition of one of the principle targets of TOR signaling,
S6K, extends the lifespan of an eat-2 C. elegans DR model (Hansen et al., 2007). These data suggest that, as with many other
pathways (Greer and Brunet, 2009), DR treatment and TOR inhibition promote lifespan via overlapping, yet partially distinct
pathways.
Recently, a multicentric study from the National Institute on
Aging, the Interventions Testing Program (ITP) reported that inhibition of mTOR with rapamycin expands maximal and median life
span in mice (Harrison et al., 2009; Miller et al., 2011). Interestingly, this effect was observed even when the treatment was initiated late in life, at 600 days, which corresponds roughly to an age
of 60 years in humans. Although these results cannot be directly
extrapolated to humans, they do suggest that mTORC1 inhibition may be effective in treating age-related diseases even
when the treatment is initiated in middle-aged humans.
As mentioned previously, rapamycin induces a diabetes-like
syndrome by reducing b-cell mass and disrupting glucose and
lipid homeostasis in vivo. Such profound deterioration of the
metabolic profile is commonly associated with a reduction but
not an increase in life span. The reason for this paradox is unclear
but could be due the use of different formulations of rapamycin.
In the longevity studies, rapamycin was microencapsulated and
added to the food, whereas the drug was administered daily by
intraperitoneal injection in the other studies. The lower bioavailability and the different pharmacokinetic of the microencapsulated rapamycin have probably limited the exposure of the
tissues to the drug, thus reducing its negative impact on metabolism. An exhaustive examination of plasma metabolites and
insulin sensitivity in mice treated with rapamycin in the longevity
studies is required to clarify this important issue. Overall, these
observations support the idea that the dose of rapamycin has
to be carefully adjusted in order to get benefic effects on both
longevity and metabolism.
How mTORC1 inhibition increases longevity in mammals is an
unresolved issue. In mice, rapamycin-mediated life extension is
not associated with change in disease patterns or causes of
death (Harrison et al., 2009; Miller et al., 2011). This indicates
that rapamycin is likely to increase life span by slowing down
age-related pathologies. It is possible that mTORC1 inhibition
could prevent tissue degeneration by improving stem cell func-

tion. Chen et al. (2009) observed that old mice have elevated
mTORC1 signaling in hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and that
induction of mTORC1 by Tsc1 loss induces premature aging in
HSC. Importantly, reducing mTORC1 signaling with rapamycin
restores HSC self-renewal and hematopoietic function, improves
immunity, and increases life span. This result confirmed previous
observations showing that inhibition of mTORC1 prevents stem
cell exhaustion and increases stem cell function in vivo (Castilho
et al., 2009; Yilmaz et al., 2006). Interestingly, mTORC1 activity
is also elevated in the liver of old mice. Such elevation in
mTORC1 signaling impairs fasting-induced ketogenesis, which
is a common phenotype associated with aging (Sengupta et al.,
2010). Whether specific tissues or cell types play dominant roles
in the effect of mTORC1 inhibition on longevity is unknown.
Which effectors downstream of mTORC1 modulate the aging
process is still unknown (Figure 6). A reduction in S6K activity
increases life span in various species and, in mice, S6K1 loss
increases resistance to age-related pathologies (reviewed in
Kapahi et al. [2010]). The other classic mTORC1 substrate
4E-BP has also been shown to regulate the aging process. In
flies, loss of 4E-BP reduces life extension induced by DR,
whereas overexpression of a gain-of-function form of 4E-BP is
sufficient to extend life span under rich nutrient conditions (Zid
et al., 2009). The attenuation of mRNA translation, ribosome biogenesis, and protein synthesis downstream of the mTORC1S6K1 and À4E-BP1 axis probably plays an important role in
regulating life span as impairing these processes extends life in
several species (reviewed in Kapahi et al. [2010]). Importantly,
mTORC1 may also control life span through complementary
mechanisms that are not associated with modulation of protein
synthesis. For instance, the promotion of autophagy linked to
mTORC1 inhibition could mediate some effects of mTORC1 on
longevity. Substantial evidence indicates that suppression of autophagy in worms blocks the life span extension mediated by
TOR inhibition (To´th et al., 2008). Inducing autophagy could
reduce aging by favoring the degradation of aberrant proteins
and damaged organelles that are accumulating over time and
impairing cellular fitness.
Perspectives
The last decade has seen a rapid rise in interest in and knowledge about the mTOR pathway. Much surely remains to be

discovered, but we now know enough about the pathway and its
function in normal and disease physiology that efforts to modulate it for therapeutic benefit can move forward in a more
reasoned fashion. It is quite amazing how much has been
learned using just rapamycin, considering how, in retrospect,
its capacity to partially inhibit mTORC1 and mTORC2 and trigger
numerous feedback signals greatly complicates the interpretation of its cellular effects. Undoubtedly, direct catalytic inhibitors
of mTOR will continue to have a major impact on our understanding of the pathway and have already solved long-standing
mysteries, such as the mTOR-dependence but rapamycin-resistance of 4E-BP phosphorylation. It remains to be determined
how broadly useful such molecules will be in the clinical setting.
As discussed here, many common pathological conditions,
including cancer and neurodegeneration, might benefit from
mTOR inhibition. However, given the central role of mTOR in
the basic physiology of all growing and dividing cells, it is also
likely that very strong inhibition of mTOR will have considerable
adverse effects in human beings. Although such effects may
be tolerable in the treatment of acutely life-threatening diseases,
such as cancer, they may be more problematic for chronic
conditions requiring long treatment times. In fact, it may be
that partial inhibition of mTORC1 and mTORC2, as caused by rapamycin, is about as much mTOR inhibition as can be tolerated
in a chronic setting. If that turns out to be the case, a better
understanding of the functions of the mTOR-interacting proteins
might allow for the development of allosteric modulators of the
mTOR complexes that perturb their function toward only certain
effectors.
