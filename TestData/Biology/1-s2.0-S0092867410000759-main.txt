Inflammasomes are molecular platforms activated upon cellular infection or stress that trigger the
maturation of proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1b to engage innate immune
defenses. Strong associations between dysregulated inflammasome activity and human heritable
and acquired inflammatory diseases highlight the importance this pathway in tailoring immune
responses. Here, we comprehensively review mechanisms directing normal inflammasome function and its dysregulation in disease. Agonists and activation mechanisms of the NLRP1, NLRP3,
IPAF, and AIM2 inflammasomes are discussed. Regulatory mechanisms that potentiate or limit
inflammasome activation are examined, as well as emerging links between the inflammasome
and pyroptosis and autophagy.
Traditionally, innate immunity has been viewed as the first line of
defense discriminating ‘‘self’’ (e.g., host proteins) from ‘‘nonself’’
(e.g., microorganisms). However, emerging literature suggests
that innate immunity actually serves as a sophisticated system
for sensing signals of ‘‘danger,’’ such as pathogenic microbes
or host-derived signals of cellular stress, while remaining unresponsive to nondangerous motifs, such as normal host molecules, dietary antigens, or commensal gut flora. The notion that
innate immunity functions as a danger sentinel has similarities
to Matzinger’s ‘‘danger hypothesis,’’ proposed for adaptive
immune responses (Matzinger, 1994). Such a model for recognizing situations of host danger allows for coordinate activation
of immune system antimicrobial and tissue repair functions in
response to infection or injury, while avoiding collateral damage
in situations in which harmless nonself is present.
The innate immune system engages an array of germlineencoded pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) to detect invariant microbial motifs. PRRs are expressed by cells at the front
line of defense against infection, including macrophages, monocytes, dendritic cells, neutrophils, and epithelial cells, as well
as cells of the adaptive immune system. PRRs include the
membrane-bound Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and C-type lectins
(CTLs), which scan the extracellular milieu and endosomal
compartments for pathogen-associated molecular patterns
(PAMPs). Intracellular nucleic-acid sensing PRRs cooperate to
provide cytosolic surveillance, including the RNA-sensing RIGlike helicases (RLHs), RIG-I and MDA5, and the DNA sensors,
DAI and AIM2. The outcome of PAMP recognition by PRRs
depends upon the nature of both the responding cell and the
invading microbe. However, signal transduction from these
receptors converges on a common set of signaling modules,
often including the activation of the NF-kB and AP-1 transcription factors that drive proinflammatory cytokine/chemokine
production and members of the IRF transcription factor
family that mediate type I interferon (IFN)-dependent antiviral
responses. A further set of intracellular PRRs, distinct from those
described above, are the NOD-like receptors (NLRs) that recog-

nize PAMPs, as well as host-derived danger signals (dangerassociated molecular patterns, DAMPs). Microbial detection
by PRRs such as TLRs is reviewed elsewhere (see Review by
O. Takeuchi and S. Akira et al. on page 805 of this issue). This
Review focuses on those PRRs that assemble into high-molecular weight, caspase-1-activating platforms called ‘‘inflammasomes’’ that control maturation and secretion of interleukins
such as IL-1b and IL-18, whose potent proinflammatory activities
direct host responses to infection and injury.
The NLR Family
The NLRs are comprised of 22 human genes and many more
mouse genes because of gene expansion since the last common
ancestor. The NLR family is characterized by the presence
of a central nucleotide-binding and oligomerization (NACHT)
domain, which is commonly flanked by C-terminal leucine-rich
repeats (LRRs) and N-terminal caspase recruitment (CARD) or
pyrin (PYD) domains. LRRs are believed to function in ligand
sensing and autoregulation, whereas CARD and PYD domains
mediate homotypic protein-protein interactions for downstream
signaling. The NACHT domain, which is the only domain common to all NLR family members, enables activation of the
signaling complex via ATP-dependent oligomerization. Phylogenetic analysis of NLR family NACHT domains reveals 3 distinct
subfamilies within the NLR family: the NODs (NOD1-2, NOD3/
NLRC3, NOD4/NLRC5, NOD5/NLRX1, CIITA), the NLRPs
(NLRP1-14, also called NALPs) and the IPAF subfamily, consisting of IPAF (NLRC4) and NAIP (Figure 1A). The phylogenetic relationships between subfamily members (Figure 1A) are also supported by similarities in domain structures (Figure 1B). This is
particularly clear for the NLRPs, which all contain PYD, NACHT,
and LRR domains, with the exception of NLRP10, which lacks
LRRs. This Review uses the most common NLR family nomenclature; however, an alternative nomenclature based on NLR
family member domain structure was proposed (Ting et al.,
2008), and a full list of alternative gene names for NLRP1,
NLRP3, and IPAF are given in Table S1 available online.

Figure 1. Human and Mouse NLR Family Members
(A) Phylogenetic relationships between NACHT domains of each human (uppercase) and mouse (lowercase) NLR (NOD-like receptor) protein show 3 distinct
subfamilies within the NLRs: the NOD, NLRP, and IPAF subfamilies.
(B) Domain structures for human NLRs reveal commonalities within the subfamilies. Domains are classified according to the NCBI domain annotation tool for the
longest human protein product, with the exception of the FIIND domain that was identified independently of NCBI (Tschopp et al., 2003). It should be noted that
CIITA is often annotated as harboring a CARD domain, because a splice variant expressed in dendritic cells contains a domain with homology to CARD domains
(Nickerson et al., 2001); however, the translated transcript variant is not classified as containing a classical CARD domain by typical approaches (NCBI conserved
domains, Simple Modular Architecture Research Tool [SMART]). Likewise, these domain prediction approaches do not classify NOD3 and NOD4 as CARDcontaining and experimental evidence for a CARD domain function has yet to be reported. Domains: BIR, baculoviral inhibition of apoptosis protein repeat
domain; CARD, caspase recruitment domain; FIIND, domain with function to find; LRR, leucine-rich repeat; NACHT, nucleotide-binding and oligomerization
domain; PYD, pyrin domain.

The class II transactivator (CIITA) was the first NLR to be characterized, and is a key regulator of class II MHC genes that is
mutated in bare lymphocyte syndrome (Steimle et al., 1993).
The transcriptional coactivator factor function of CIITA appears
to be distinct among NLRs, as no other NLRs have been shown
to exert transcriptional regulator activity or other nuclear functions. Other members of the NLR family are generally considered
to perform cytoplasmic surveillance for PAMPs or DAMPs.
NOD1 and NOD2 both recognize breakdown products of bacterial cell walls (mesodiaminopimelic acid and muramyl dipeptide
[MDP], respectively) and, upon ligand sensing, oligomerize and
recruit RIP2 via CARD-CARD interactions. Assembly of NOD1
and NOD2 signalosomes ultimately culminates in the activation
of the NF-kB transcription factor, which drives proinflammatory
gene regulation (reviewed in Kufer et al., 2006). Mutations in
NOD2 are associated with human inflammatory diseases such
as Crohn’s disease and Blau syndrome (Hugot et al., 2001;

822 Cell 140, 821–832, March 19, 2010 ª2010 Elsevier Inc.

Miceli-Richard et al., 2001; Ogura et al., 2001). The functions
of NOD3 and NOD4 await clarification. The function of NOD5
(NLRX1) is a matter of debate; recent reports position NOD5
within the mitochondrial matrix, or, alternatively, as recruited to
the outer mitochondrial membrane, and propose functions in
either suppressing MAVS-dependent antiviral pathways or
promoting the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS)
(Arnoult et al., 2009; Moore et al., 2008; Tattoli et al., 2008).
Many of the remaining NLR family members are poorly characterized at present; however, we describe below the function of
those NLR family members that regulate caspase-1 activity
through inflammasome formation.
Inflammasomes: Platforms for Caspase-1 Activation
and IL-1b Maturation
Caspases are cysteine proteases that initiate or execute cellular
programs, leading to inflammation or cell death. They are

synthesized as inactive zymogens, and their potent cellular
activities are tightly controlled by proteolytic activation. Caspases are categorized as either proinflammatory or proapoptotic, depending upon their participation in these cellular
programs. The proinflammatory caspases are comprised of caspase-1, -11 and -12 in mouse and caspase-1, -4, and -5 in
human (Martinon and Tschopp, 2007). Caspase-12 is mutated
to encode a nonfunctional protein in most human populations
(Xue et al., 2006). Of the proinflammatory caspases, caspase-1
is the most fully characterized. Its catalytic activity is tightly regulated by signal-dependent autoactivation within multiprotein
complexes called ‘‘inflammasomes’’ that mediate caspase-1dependent processing of cytokines such as IL-1b (Martinon
et al., 2002).
IL-1b is an important proinflammatory mediator that is generated at sites of injury or immunological challenge to coordinate
programs as diverse as cellular recruitment to a site of infection
or injury and the regulation of sleep, appetite, and body temperature (see Review by C.A. Dinarello on page 935 of this issue).
IL-1b activity is rigorously controlled by expression, maturation,
and secretion; proinflammatory stimuli induce expression of the
inactive IL-1b proform, but cytokine maturation and release are
controlled by inflammasomes. An endogenous IL-1 receptor
antagonist (IL-1RA) also regulates IL-1b action. Most reports
characterizing inflammasomes have focused on cells of the
myeloid lineage, such as macrophages or dendritic cells;
however, cells outside the myeloid compartment can activate
inflammasomes. For example, keratinocyte exposure to skin irritants or ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiation triggers NLRP3 inflammasome activation (Feldmeyer et al., 2007; Watanabe et al., 2007).
Inflammasomes are assembled by self-oligomerizing scaffold
proteins. A number of NLR family member have been reported to
exhibit inflammasome activity in vitro; however, few NLR family
members have clear physiological functions in vivo. NLRP1,
NLRP3, and IPAF are danger sentinels that self-oligomerize via
homotypic NACHT domain interactions to form high-molecular
weight complexes (probably hexamers or heptamers) that
trigger caspase-1 autoactivation. The HIN-200 family member,
AIM2, also mediates inflammasome assembly. Inflammasome
components and activation mechanisms depend on the nature
of the individual protein scaffolds (Figure 2). Domain structure
conservation between NLRPs (Figure 1B) suggests that uncharacterized family members may also mediate or regulate inflammasome activation.
The NLRP3 Inflammasome
The NLRP3 inflammasome is currently the most fully characterized inflammasome and consists of the NLRP3 scaffold, the ASC
(PYCARD) adaptor, and caspase-1. NLRP3 is activated upon
exposure to whole pathogens, as well as a number of structurally
diverse PAMPs, DAMPs, and environmental irritants (Table S1).
Whole pathogens demonstrated to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome include the fungi Candida albicans and Saccharomyces
cerevisiae that signal to the inflammasome via Syk (Gross et al.,
2009), bacteria that produce pore-forming toxins, including
Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus (Mariathasan et al., 2006), and viruses such as Sendai virus, adenovirus,
and influenza virus (Kanneganti et al., 2006; Muruve et al.,
2008). In some cases, the individual microbial components

For simplicity, the unoligomerized inflammasome complexes are depicted.
Removal of the CARD domain and processing of the caspase domain of caspase-1 by autocleavage at the indicated sites results in the formation of the
active caspase-1 p10/p20 tetramer. It should be noted that although human
NLRP1 contains a PYD, mouse NLRP1 proteins do not harbor functional
PYDs. Human NLRP1 can also recruit a second caspase, caspase-5, to the
complex (not shown). Maximal caspase-1 activation in response to IPAF
agonists can require ASC or NAIP, depending on the stimulus. The interaction
of these proteins with the IPAF inflammasome activation is currently unclear.
Domains: CARD, caspase recruitment domain; FIIND, domain with function
to find; HIN, HIN-200/IF120x domain; LRR, leucine-rich repeat; NACHT, nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domain; PYD, pyrin domain.

(PAMPs, virulence factors) that activate the inflammasome
have been identified (for instance, the alpha-toxin of S. aureus;
Craven et al., 2009).
The unexpected finding that the NLRP3 inflammasome can be
activated by host-derived molecules forms part of an emerging
literature supporting a model in which the innate immune system
detects endogenous indicators of cellular danger or stress,

Cell 140, 821–832, March 19, 2010 ª2010 Elsevier Inc. 823

a hypothesis with similarities to the ‘‘danger model’’ proposed
for adaptive immune responses in place of the more simplistic
self/nonself recognition model (Matzinger, 1994). A number of
host-derived molecules indicative of injury activate the NLRP3
inflammasome, including extracellular ATP (Mariathasan et al.,
2006) and hyaluronan (Yamasaki et al., 2009) that are released
by injured cells. Fibrillar amyloid-b peptide, the major component of Alzheimer’s disease brain plaques, also activates the
NLRP3 inflammasome (Halle et al., 2008). The NLRP3 inflammasome also detects signs of metabolic stress, including elevated
extracellular glucose (Zhou et al., 2010) such as that occurring in
metabolic syndrome, and monosodium urate (MSU) crystals that
form as a consequence of hyperuricemia in the autoinflammatory disease gout (Martinon et al., 2006). Uric acid can also be
released during cell injury, and uric acid-dependent pathways
in this context also activate the inflammasome (Gasse et al.,
2009; Griffith et al., 2009). Additionally, the NLRP3 inflammasome drives inflammation in response to a number of environmental irritants, including silica (Cassel et al., 2008; Dostert
et al., 2008; Hornung et al., 2008), asbestos (Cassel et al.,
2008; Dostert et al., 2008), UVB irradiation (Feldmeyer et al.,
2007), and skin irritants such as trinitrophenylchloride, trinitrochlorobenzene, and dinitrofluorobenzene (Sutterwala et al.,
2006; Watanabe et al., 2007). NLRP3 inflammasome activation
in response to these insults has been linked to pathology associated with silicosis, asbestosis, sunburn, and contact hypersensitivity reactions, respectively.
Models for NLRP3 Activation
Prior to agonist treatment, the NLRP3 LRR domains are thought
to mediate autoinhibition in a manner similar to that described for
IPAF (Poyet et al., 2001). This may be mediated by the SGT1 and
HSP90 chaperones that appear to hold NLRP3 in an inactive, but
signal-competent state; these chaperones also interact with
IPAF (Mayor et al., 2007). Upon NLRP3 activation, NLRP3 oligomerization leads to PYD domain clustering and presentation for
homotypic interaction with the PYD- and CARD-containing
adaptor ASC, whose CARD domain in turn recruits the CARD
of procaspase-1. Procaspase-1 clustering permits autocleavage
and formation of the active caspase-1 p10/p20 tetramer, which
then processes cytokine proforms such as IL-1b to generate
the active molecules. Mature IL-1b is secreted alongside caspase-1 by an unconventional protein secretion pathway that is
currently unclear.
Mechanisms leading to NLRP3 inflammasome activation are
intensely debated. Three models that may not be exclusive are
widely supported in the literature (Figure 3). Extracellular ATP
stimulates the purogenic P2X7 ATP-gated ion channel (Kahlenberg and Dubyak, 2004), triggering K+ efflux and inducing
gradual recruitment of the pannexin-1 membrane pore (Kanneganti et al., 2007). The first model posits that pore formation
allows extracellular NLRP3 agonists to access the cytosol and
directly activate NLRP3 (Kanneganti et al., 2007). However, the
structural diversity within NLRP3 agonists argues against direct
interaction between NLRP3 and all of its activators.
A second model was proposed for activators that form crystalline or particulate structures, such as MSU, silica, asbestos,
amyloid-b, and alum, wherein engulfment of these agonists by
phagocytes leads to lysosomal damage, resulting in cytosolic

824 Cell 140, 821–832, March 19, 2010 ª2010 Elsevier Inc.

Figure 3. NLRP3 Inflammasome Activation
Three major models for NLRP3 inflammasome activation are favored in the
field, which may not be exclusive: (1) The NLRP3 agonist, ATP, triggers
P2X7-dependent pore formation by the pannexin-1 hemichannel, allowing
extracellular NLRP3 agonists to enter the cytosol and directly engage
NLRP3. (2) Crystalline or particulate NLRP3 agonists are engulfed, and their
physical characteristics lead to lysosomal rupture. The NLRP3 inflammasome
senses lysosomal content in the cytoplasm, for example, via cathepsinB-dependent processing of a direct NLRP3 ligand. (3) All danger-associated
molecular patterns (DAMPs) and pathogen-associated molecular patterns
(PAMPs), including ATP and particulate/crystalline activators, trigger the
generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). A ROS-dependent pathway triggers NLRP3 inflammasome complex formation. Caspase-1 clustering induces
autoactivation and caspase-1-dependent maturation and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1b (IL-1b) and IL-18.

release of lysosomal contents that are somehow sensed by the
NLRP3 inflammasome (Halle et al., 2008; Hornung et al., 2008).
A role for the lysosomal protease, cathepsin B, in activation of
a direct NLRP3 ligand was suggested in this model (Halle
et al., 2008; Hornung et al., 2008). However, cathepsin B-deficient macrophages exhibit normal caspase-1 activation and
IL-1b maturation in response to particulate NLRP3 agonists
(Dostert et al., 2009), implicating off-target effects of the
cathepsin B inhibitor, as was recently suggested for NLRP1
(Newman et al., 2009).
Under the third model, all NLRP3 agonists trigger the generation of ROS, and this common pathway engages the NLRP3
inflammasome (Cassel et al., 2008; Cruz et al., 2007; Dostert
et al., 2008). The production of ROS represents one of the
most evolutionarily conserved pathways of response to infection
or injury; for example, a gradient of ROS is the apical signal
directing wound healing in zebrafish (Niethammer et al., 2009),
and ROS are antimicrobial effectors in plants (Bolwell, 1999).
In support of this model, all NLRP3 agonists tested, including
ATP and particulate activators, induce ROS and ROS blockade
by chemical scavengers suppresses inflammasome activation
(Cassel et al., 2008; Cruz et al., 2007; Dostert et al., 2008; Gross
et al., 2009; Pe´trilli et al., 2007; Shio et al., 2009).
The source of ROS is currently unclear, but one or several
NADPH oxidases are implicated, as suppression of the common
p22 subunit inhibits inflammasome activation (Dostert et al.,
2008); alternatively, ROS may be of mitochondrial origin. Mechanisms directing ROS-dependent NLRP3 inflammasome activation remain to be characterized in detail; however, a recent report
implicates a ROS-sensitive NLRP3 ligand, thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP/VDUP1), in NLRP3 activation (Zhou et al.,
2010).
Despite strong evidence for the ROS model, a number of
aspects of this model require resolution. For example, some
ROS-inducing agents (such as cytokines) do not engage the
NLRP3 inflammasome, suggesting that while necessary, ROS
alone is insufficient for triggering NLRP3 activity. Alternatively,
a very specific ROS location or nature may be required. Additionally, superoxide directly inhibits caspase-1 activity by modifying
redox-sensitive cysteines (Meissner et al., 2008); whether such
a mechanism provides temporal- or dose-dependent negative
feedback to limit caspase-1 function triggered by a ROS-dependent NLRP3 pathway requires clarification. The manner by which
cytoplasmic K+ concentration modulates NLRP3 activity is also
currently unclear. Macrophages cultured in medium containing
a high concentration of K+ show decreased capacity for
NLRP3-dependent caspase-1 activation in response to a range
of agonists, suggesting that K+ efflux is necessary upstream of
NLRP3 activation (Dostert et al., 2008; Fernandes-Alnemri
et al., 2007; Franchi et al., 2007a; Gross et al., 2009; Pe´trilli
et al., 2007; Shio et al., 2009). Future studies are required to
determine whether ionic flux and ROS pathways are inter-regulated or independently required for NLRP3 activation.
The NLRP1 Inflammasome
The NLRP1 inflammasome was the first to be described. Human
NLRP1 has three orthologs in mouse (Nlrp1a-c, Figure 1) that are
highly polymorphic between inbred mouse strains (Boyden and
Dietrich, 2006). Strain variation in the mouse Nlrp1b locus

appears to underlie susceptibility to Bacillus anthracis lethal
toxin (LeTx), as macrophages from susceptible, but not resistant, mouse strains activate caspase-1 after LeTx exposure
(Boyden and Dietrich, 2006). The NLRP1 inflammasome can
also be activated by MDP (Faustin et al., 2007).
As a consequence of domain structure differences between
NLRP1 and NLRP3, the minimal components of the NLRP1
inflammasome are somewhat different to its NLRP3 counterpart
(Figure 2). NLRP1 contains a C-terminal extension that harbors
a CARD domain, which can interact directly with procaspase-1
and bypass the requirement for ASC, although ASC inclusion
in the complex augmented human NLRP1 inflammasome activity (Faustin et al., 2007). Unlike human NLRP1, murine NLRP1
orthologs lack functional PYD domains and are predicted to be
unable to interact with ASC. Indeed, ASC is dispensable for caspase-1 activation by NLRP1b in mouse macrophages (Hsu et al.,
2008). In addition to caspase-1, NLRP1 also interacts with caspase-5, which may contribute to IL-1b processing in human cells
(Martinon et al., 2002). The exact mechanisms of NLRP1 activation remain obscure, but, as for NLRP3, K+ efflux appears to be
essential (Fink et al., 2008; Wickliffe et al., 2008).
The IPAF Inflammasome
The IPAF inflammasome is activated by gram-negative bacteria
possessing type III or IV secretion systems, such as Salmonella
typhimurium, Shigella flexneri, Legionella pneumophila, and
Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Amer et al., 2006; Franchi et al.,
2007b; Mariathasan et al., 2004; Miao et al., 2008; Sutterwala
et al., 2007; Suzuki et al., 2007). As IPAF contains a CARD
domain, it could be expected to interact directly with procaspase-1, which is indeed the case (Figure 2) (Poyet et al., 2001).
Maximal caspase-1 activation in response to S. typhimurium,
S. flexneri, and P. aeruginosa requires the ASC adaptor (Franchi
et al., 2007b; Mariathasan et al., 2004; Suzuki et al., 2007). The
role for ASC in the IPAF inflammasome remains unclear; it is
presumed that these proteins do not interact directly as IPAF
does not contain a PYD domain. It is possible that IPAF collaborates with a PYD-containing protein (such as an NLRP) for
responses to these pathogens. ASC is dispensable for IPAFdependent caspase-1 activation in response to L. pneumophila
(Case et al., 2009), but protection against this pathogen appears
to require IPAF collaboration with another NLR family member,
NAIP (Ren et al., 2006; Zamboni et al., 2006). IPAF-dependent
caspase-1 activation is accompanied by rapid cell death (Fink
and Cookson, 2006). Interestingly, the pathways downstream
of IPAF appear to be independently regulated; maximal caspase-1 activation by the IPAF inflammasome requires ASC, but
IPAF-dependent cell death is independent of ASC upon macrophage infection with S. flexneri (Suzuki et al., 2007; Suzuki and
Nu´n˜ez, 2008) and P. aeruginosa (Sutterwala et al., 2007).
The exact mechanisms directing IPAF inflammasome activation and the participation of ASC and NAIP in this process remain
elusive. The LRR domain of IPAF is likely to autorepress in the
absence of ligand, as removal of the LRR domain from IPAF
results in a spontaneously active mutant (Poyet et al., 2001).
The IPAF inflammasome is activated by cytosolic flagellin
(Miao et al., 2007). It is likely that other PAMPs modulate IPAF
function, as P. aeruginosa appears to activate IPAF through
flagellin-dependent and -independent pathways (Miao et al.,

Cell 140, 821–832, March 19, 2010 ª2010 Elsevier Inc. 825

2008; Sutterwala et al., 2007), and nonflagellated bacteria such
as S. flexneri trigger IPAF inflammasome activity (Suzuki et al.,
2007). IPAF activation depends upon virulence factor injection
into the cytosol via bacterial type III and IV secretion systems
(Ren et al., 2006; Sun et al., 2007; Suzuki et al., 2007). Cytosolic
localization of flagellin by other means (liposomes, expression
systems) is sufficient for IPAF-dependent caspase-1 activation,
suggesting that the sole function of bacterial secretion systems
in IPAF activation is cytoplasmic injection of bacterial components (Franchi et al., 2006; Lightfield et al., 2008; Miao et al.,
2006). Unlike NLRP3, IPAF inflammasome activity is not inhibited
by high extracellular K+, suggesting that IPAF is not a sensor for
ionic flux (Pe´trilli et al., 2007). Direct interaction between IPAF
and an activating ligand has not been demonstrated, so it is
possible that IPAF senses a common pathway induced by cytosolic PAMPs, analogous to the ROS pathway proposed for
NLRP3.
The AIM2 Inflammasome
The recent identification of the HIN-200 family member, AIM2, as
a cytosolic double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) sensor that induces
caspase-1-dependent IL-1b maturation is an important advance
in the inflammasome field (Bu¨rckstu¨mmer et al., 2009; Fernandes-Alnemri et al., 2009; Hornung et al., 2009; Roberts
et al., 2009). It is the first identification of a non-NLR family member forming an inflammasome scaffold, and oligomerization
of the complex is suggested to be mediated not by a central
oligomerization domain within the inflammasome scaffold protein (as for the NLR NACHT domain) but by clustering upon
multiple binding sites in the ligand, dsDNA, to which AIM2 binds
via its C-terminal HIN domain (Bu¨rckstu¨mmer et al., 2009; Fernandes-Alnemri et al., 2009; Hornung et al., 2009). The AIM2
inflammasome is composed of AIM2, ASC, and caspase-1.
AIM2 contains a PYD domain that, as for NLRP3, interacts with
ASC via homotypic PYD-PYD interactions, allowing the ASC
CARD domain to recruit procaspase-1 to the complex (Figure 2).
As for other inflammasomes, upon autoactivation, caspase-1
directs proinflammatory cytokine maturation and secretion
(such as IL-1b and IL-18). Ligand requirements for AIM2 are quite
permissive, as cytosolic dsDNA from virus, bacteria, or the host
itself can activate the AIM2 inflammasome (Hornung et al., 2009;
Muruve et al., 2008). Further studies are required to firmly establish the physiological relevance of this pathway, but AIM2 is
proposed to function in cytosolic surveillance for DNA viruses
and may contribute to autoimmune responses against selfDNA in systemic lupus erythematosus.
Regulation of Inflammasome Activity
and IL-1b Secretion
TLRs and Other Proinflammatory Signaling Pathways
Both inflammasome activity and pro-IL-1b availability are highly
influenced by integration with proinflammatory signaling pathways such as those triggered by TLR ligation. For this reason,
experimental protocols examining inflammasome activation
commonly include ‘‘priming’’ with a TLR agonist (such as lipopolysaccharide, LPS) or a proinflammatory cytokine (such as
tumor necrosis factor, TNF). Most importantly, although inflammasome-dependent caspase-1 activation can be observed in
the absence of priming, IL-1b secretion is minimal, because

826 Cell 140, 821–832, March 19, 2010 ª2010 Elsevier Inc.

most cells do not constitutively express pro-IL-1b. Pro-IL-1b is
potently induced by proinflammatory signals such as LPS or
TNF that activate the NF-kB transcription factor and allow
IL-1b promoter activation (Hiscott et al., 1993). Although the
primary function of priming in experimental protocols is to induce
pro-IL-1b, it also potentiates NLRP3 inflammasome activity
through NF-kB-dependent induction of NLRP3, which may be
a limiting component of the complex (Bauernfeind et al., 2009).
Whether other inflammasomes are similarly subject to synergy
from priming signals has yet to be determined. The IFN-inducible
nature of AIM2 (DeYoung et al., 1997) suggests that it could also
be primed in such a manner by TLR agonists that induce autocrine type I IFN or indeed by IFNs themselves.
A recent report suggests that inflammasome activity is modulated by antiviral pathways (Poeck et al., 2010). RIG-I ligation by
vesicular stomatitis virus or synthetic RNA triggered caspase-1
activity and IL-1b maturation, in a manner independent of the
MAVS and CARD9 adaptors that mediate RIG-I-dependent transcriptional responses (e.g., NF-kB and IFN pathways). The exact
mechanisms directing RIG-I-dependent caspase-1 activation
are currently unclear. RIG-I-dependent caspase-1 cleavage is
ASC dependent but occurs independently of NLRP3, suggesting
either that RIG-I can form its own inflammasome or that it regulates the activity of a known or uncharacterized NLRP3-independent inflammasome. Antiviral pathways triggered by the related
RIG-I-like helicase, MDA5, also modulate caspase-1 cleavage;
MDA5 collaborates with NLRP3 for inflammasome responses
to encephalomyocarditis virus (Poeck et al., 2010). In this case,
augmented NLRP3 inflammasome activity may be mediated at
least partially through MDA5-dependent ‘‘priming’’ of inflammasome activity, for instance by sensitizing cells to NLRP3 agonists
via NLRP3 induction.
Negative Regulation of Inflammasome Activation
The importance of the inflammasome in controlling infection is
highlighted by microbial evolution of inflammasome inhibitors. These include viral PYD proteins and various bacterial virulence factors that inhibit caspase-1 activation. Such factors are
reviewed extensively elsewhere (Martinon et al., 2009). A number
of host mechanisms also suppress inflammasome activation and
presumably function to inhibit the extent of potentially dangerous
immune activation.
Most recently, mouse CD4+ effector and memory T cells were
demonstrated to suppress NLRP1 and NLRP3, but not IPAF,
inflammasome-mediated caspase-1 activity and IL-1b secretion
(Guarda et al., 2009). Inhibition is dependent on cell-cell contact
and is mediated by signaling by specific TNF family ligands
(Guarda et al., 2009). Such an inhibitory pathway is likely to aid
in ‘‘switching off’’ innate immune responses once the adaptive
arm of the immune system is engaged.
A number of CARD- and PYD-containing proteins have been
proposed to suppress inflammasome activity by blocking inflammasome component recruitment. Such PYD-containing proteins
include pyrin, POP1 (PYDC1), and POP2 (PYDC2). The biological
relevance of POP1- and POP2-dependent inflammasome inhibition is difficult to assess, as these genes are only present in
primates. Conversely, modulation of inflammasome activity by
pyrin has clear physiological relevance, as human pyrin
mutations are responsible for familial Mediterranean fever

(The International FMF Consortium, 1997); however, the underlying disease-driving mechanisms await clarification. Pryin may
inhibit inflammasome activation by sequestering ASC (Chae
et al., 2003), or, alternatively, pyrin may itself form an inflammasome (Yu et al., 2006). Further evidence for an important regulatory function for pyrin comes from a pyrin-interacting protein,
PSTPIP1, mutations in which are associated with elevated
IL-1b in the autoinflammatory disease, pyogenic arthritis,
pyoderma gangrenosum, and acne (PAPA) (Shoham et al.,
2003; Wise et al., 2002). CARD-containing proteins, such as
human COP, INCA, iceberg, and caspase-12, are suggested to
suppress inflammasome activation by preventing caspase-1
recruitment. Caspase-12 is proposed to function as a decoy
inhibitor of caspase-1 (Saleh et al., 2006), but caspase-12 is
nonfunctional in most human populations (Xue et al., 2006).
As for POPs 1 and 2, COP, INCA, and iceberg do not have nonprimate orthologs. The evolution of a raft of potential inflammasome inhibitors in humans suggests strong selection pressure
for control over inflammasome activation.
The antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL inhibit the inflammasome. These proteins interact with NLRP1 and suppress
NLRP1-dependent caspase-1 activation and IL-1b secretion
(Bruey et al., 2007), potentially by inhibiting ATP binding to the
NLRP1 NACHT domain, a necessary step for NACHT domain
oligomerization (Faustin et al., 2009).
Activated caspase-1 is secreted alongside mature IL-1b after
inflammasome activation. It is possible that caspase-1 has
extracellular functions; however, given its potent intracellular
functions and the almost undetectable levels of activated caspase-1 within stimulated cells in most experimental settings, it
is tempting to speculate that rapid caspase-1 release after activation represents an important regulatory mechanism to limit the
activity of cytosolic caspase-1.
Inflammasome Activation Promotes Pyroptosis
Inflammasome-dependent caspase-1 activity can result in
a highly inflammatory form of cell death known as pyroptosis in
myeloid cells (Bergsbaken et al., 2009). Pyroptosis occurs
most frequently upon infection with intracellular pathogens
(Case et al., 2009; Fink et al., 2008; Suzuki et al., 2007) and is
likely to form part of the antimicrobial response. Pyroptosis is
caspase-1 dependent by definition and occurs independently
of proapoptotic caspases (Bergsbaken et al., 2009). Although
pyroptosis is considered to be a form of programmed cell death,
it is distinct from the immunologically silent cell death presented
by apoptosis. Pyroptosis is accompanied by plasma membrane
rupture, water influx, cellular swelling, osmotic lysis, and release
of proinflammatory cellular content (Fink and Cookson, 2006).
Pyroptosis is also accompanied by DNA cleavage and nuclear
condensation that is distinct from DNA laddering characteristic
of apoptosis, as the nuclear integrity is not compromised (Fink
and Cookson, 2006; Molofsky et al., 2006). Caspase-1-dependent inactivation of metabolic enzymes (Shao et al., 2007) is
likely to limit the cellular energy supply during pyroptosis.
The regulation of pyroptosis is not well defined; however, the
extent of pyroptosis appears to increase with increasing inflammasome stimulation, tempting speculation that pyroptosis may
occur when cytoprotection by autophagy (see below) or mecha-

nisms suppressing cytosolic caspase-1 action (e.g., secretion)
become overwhelmed. Whether pyroptosis plays a pathological
role in genetic autoinflammatory diseases that yield more active
inflammasome pathways (discussed below) has yet to be
determined.
Reciprocal Regulation of Inflammasome Activation
and Autophagic Pathways
Autophagy is a cytoprotective process by which the cell sequesters damaged proteins, organelles, or pathogens in a doublemembrane compartment, the autophagosome, targets this
cellular material for degradation in the lysosome, and recycles
the constituent molecules (Deretic and Levine, 2009). Autophagy
occurs under normal physiological conditions but can be upregulated by cellular stress such as starvation, proinflammatory
signaling (e.g., IFNg), or bacterial infection (Deretic and Levine,
2009).
Recent reports reveal a complex interplay between inflammasome and autophagic pathways. Treatment with the TLR4
agonist, LPS, in the absence of contaminating ligands does
not induce inflammasome activation in wild-type macrophages.
However, blockade of autophagy by genetic ablation of the
autophagy regulators Atg16L1 or Atg7 enables LPS-dependent
inflammasome activation, suggesting that autophagy normally
counters inflammasome activation by LPS (Saitoh et al., 2008).
Although in this study, the nature of the inflammasome scaffold
was not determined, LPS-induced inflammasome activation in
Atg16L1-deficient cells is dependent on K+ efflux and ROS,
suggestive of NLRP3 involvement. The mechanism underlying
autophagy-dependent inflammasome inhibition is currently
unclear. It has been suggested that autophagosomes may target
inflammasomes for degradation (Harris et al., 2009). However,
given that NLRP3 inflammasome activity is suppressed by
ROS blockade (discussed above) and autophagy negatively
regulates ROS generation (Bensaad et al., 2009; Dupont et al.,
2009; Rouschop et al., 2009; Saitoh et al., 2008), it is possible
that autophagic suppression of ROS indirectly inhibits inflammasome activity. Autophagy also appears to negatively regulate
pyroptosis (Suzuki and Nu´n˜ez, 2008). Interestingly, ROS derived
from either the mitochondrial electron transport chain or NAPDH
oxidases upregulates autophagy (Chen et al., 2009; Huang et al.,
2009). Thus, ROS activation of autophagic machinery may represent a negative feedback mechanism to limit ROS-modulated
caspase-1 activation while simultaneously removing ROSdamaged organelles and proteins and providing defense against
intracellular pathogens. An additional layer of complexity in the
links between inflammasomes and autophagy is suggested by
a report that the inflammasome negatively regulates autophagy
(Suzuki et al., 2007). This study found that caspase-1 deficiency
promotes autophagy in macrophages infected with the IPAF
agonist S. flexneri. Further research is required to clarify the
complex reciprocal regulation of inflammasome and autophagic
pathways.
Human Diseases Associated with Inflammasome
Pathways
Elevated local or systemic IL-1b has been linked to a number
of human hereditary or acquired diseases, and antagonists of

IL-1b or its receptor are proving successful treatments for
a number of these diseases (Table S2). Most clinical trials to
date have utilized daily injections of Anakinra, a recombinant
form of the naturally occurring antagonist, IL-1RA. However,
next-generation IL-1b antagonists are starting to become available; these include IL-1Trap, a decoy receptor with high affinity
for IL-1 (Kalliolias and Liossis, 2008), and monoclonal antibodies
that neutralize IL-1b. Clinical trials are currently assessing efficacy of Anakinra and next-generation IL-1b inhibitors for a wider
range of diseases, including cryopyrin-associated periodic
syndromes (CAPS), gout, and type II diabetes (T2D) (Hoffman,
2009; Lachmann et al., 2009a; Larsen et al., 2009; Larsen
et al., 2007; Terkeltaub et al., 2009).
Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndromes
The discovery that NLRP3 mutations are responsible for a set of
rare autoinflammatory diseases known as CAPS has revolutionized the clinical management of these diseases. CAPS are heritable diseases characterized by recurrent fever and inflammation and are comprised of three autoinflammatory disorders
that form a clinical continuum. These diseases, in order of
increasing severity, are familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome
(FCAS), Muckle-Wells syndrome (MWS), and chronic infantile
cutaneous neurological articular syndrome (CINCA; also called
neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disease, NOMID).
Myeloid cells from these patients are hyperresponsive for IL-1b
production (Agostini et al., 2004). In keeping with this, genetargeted mice harboring equivalent mutations to those found in
MWS or FCAS patients exhibit hyperactive NLRP3 inflammasomes leading to elevated IL-1b (Brydges et al., 2009; Meng
et al., 2009). Patients with these diseases respond well to IL-1b
antagonism by Anakinra (Goldbach-Mansky et al., 2006; Hawkins et al., 2004; Hawkins et al., 2003; Hoffman et al., 2004),
next-generation IL-1b antagonists (Goldbach-Mansky et al.,
2008; Hoffman, 2009; Hoffman et al., 2008; Lachmann et al.,
2009b), and caspase-1 inhibition (Stack et al., 2005). Mutations
in putative inflammasome regulators, pyrin and PSTPIP1, are
also associated with human diseases related to CAPS (discussed above and in Table S2).
Gout
Gout is an autoinflammatory disease characterized by severe
joint inflammation, resulting in arthropathy and considerable
pain. Gout is strongly associated with metabolic disturbances
leading to elevated blood uric acid levels (hyperuricemia) and
the deposition of MSU crystals in joints (Talbott, 1940). Recent
studies illuminate mechanisms underlying MSU-dependent joint
inflammation. MSU is a potent activator of the NLRP3 inflammasome in vitro (Martinon et al., 2006), and MSU-dependent
neutrophil recruitment is dependent on the ASC adaptor, caspase-1, and IL-1R in vivo (Martinon et al., 2006). A pathogenic
role for inflammasome-regulated IL-1b in gout and the closely
related disease pseudogout in humans is supported by the
success of IL-1b antagonists in clinical trials (McGonagle et al.,
2008; McGonagle et al., 2007; So et al., 2007; Terkeltaub et al.,
2009).
Type II Diabetes
An emerging role for the NLRP3 inflammasome as a sensor of
metabolic stress, as suggested by studies in gout, is reinforced
by the success of IL-1 receptor antagonism in clinical trials for

828 Cell 140, 821–832, March 19, 2010 ª2010 Elsevier Inc.

the treatment of T2D (Larsen et al., 2009; Larsen et al., 2007).
Elevated IL-1b is a risk factor for the development of T2D
(Spranger et al., 2003) and contributes to insulin resistance by
antagonizing insulin signaling (Maedler et al., 2009). IL-1b also
mediates the toxic effects of prolonged hyperglycaemia (glucotoxicity) in pancreatic islets, driving b cell destruction and dysregulating glucose-induced insulin secretion (Maedler et al., 2009).
A recent study characterized IL-1b secretion in mouse pancreatic islets during chronic hyperglycaemia; high extracellular
glucose triggers IL-1b secretion via the NLRP3 inflammasome
(Zhou et al., 2010). Moreover, the NLRP3-binding protein, TXNIP,
is itself heavily implicated in T2D, as a mediator of pancreatic
b cell death and failing peripheral glucose uptake (Parikh et al.,
2007; Shalev, 2008). Accordingly, TXNIP deficiency improves
glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity as compared to wildtype mice (Hui et al., 2008; Oka et al., 2009). Mechanisms by
which inflammasome activation and elevated IL-1b may drive
the progression from obesity to T2D are reviewed elsewhere in
detail (Schroder et al., 2010).
Disease Associations of Other NLRPs
Mutations in NLRPs other than NLRP3 have been linked to
human disease. NLRP12 mutations are associated with a fever
syndrome resembling FCAS, called FACS2 (Je´ru et al., 2008).
The authors suggest that NLRP12 mutations in these patients
disrupt the NF-kB inhibitory activity of the protein (Je´ru et al.,
2008); however, given the high homology between NLRP12
and NLRP3 (Figure 1) and the similarities in FCAS and FCAS2
patient symptoms, it is possible that inflammasome activity is
dysregulated in these patients. Mutations in NLRP1 are associated with vitiligo-associated multiple autoimmune disease (Jin
et al., 2007). NLRP2 mutation has been recently linked to a
case of familial Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome, a fetal overgrowth and imprinting disorder (Meyer et al., 2009). NLRP7
mutations are associated with familial and recurrent hydatidiform
moles, an abnormal pregnancy state in which placental villi are
degenerated and the fertilized egg is nonviable (Murdoch et al.,
2006). Disease-driving mechanisms engaged by mutation in
these genes and the potential involvement of the inflammasome
pathway await clarification.
Concluding Remarks
The past decade has witnessed great advances in our understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying innate immune
system activation. In particular, the regulation of IL-1b maturation by the NLRP1, NLRP3, IPAF, and AIM2 inflammasomes is
beginning to be characterized in detail. The potent activity of
the inflammasome in directing innate immune responses is
clearly demonstrated by a number of heritable and acquired
diseases in which NLRP3 inflammasome activity is dysregulated, and the success with which many of these diseases can
now be treated with antagonists of IL-1b or its receptor.
Despite these great advances, there remain a number of unresolved aspects of inflammasome biology. One of these is the
nature of the endogenous signal leading to pro-IL-1b induction
in these diseases. Proinflammatory cytokine signaling or PAMP
recognition by PRRs are candidate signals, and in fact a recent
study suggests that IL-1b provides its own priming signal in
CAPS patients (Lachmann et al., 2009b). This may also be true

for other diseases, such as T2D and gout. The source of ROS
that is generated in response to NLRP3-activating stimuli is
also currently unclear. Another open question is the function of
the uncharacterized NLRPs. Some of these have been demonstrated to modulate caspase-1 activity in vitro, but the ability of
these NLRPs to form inflammasome scaffolds in vivo and the
physiological situations triggering such activation remain
obscure. Disease associations of a number of NLRPs suggest
important roles in inflammatory or reproductive disease that
should prove rich ground for future research.
