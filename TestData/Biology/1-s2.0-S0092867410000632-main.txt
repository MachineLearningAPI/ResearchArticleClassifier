Autophagy has been implicated in many physiological and pathological processes. Accordingly,
there is a growing scientific need to accurately identify, quantify, and manipulate the process
of autophagy. However, as autophagy involves dynamic and complicated processes, it is often
analyzed incorrectly. In this Primer, we discuss methods to monitor autophagy and to modulate
autophagic activity, with a primary focus on mammalian macroautophagy.
Introduction
The past decade has witnessed an explosion of research on a
fundamental cell biology pathway called autophagy (Greek for
“self-eating”). The discovery of evolutionarily conserved genes
(initially identified in yeast) that are required for autophagy has
enabled scientists to uncover a vast array of homeostatic,
developmental, and other physiological functions of autophagy.
Moreover, increasing evidence suggests that the deregulation of
autophagy may contribute to a broad spectrum of mammalian
diseases (Levine and Kroemer, 2008; Mizushima et al., 2008).
Consequently, there is a rapidly growing need among scientists to
be able to accurately detect autophagy and to study its function in
diverse biological processes, especially in mammalian systems.

Research in mammalian autophagy has been historically
plagued by two major considerations. First, there has been
the challenge of capturing a “dynamic process” with “static
measurements,” and the inherent limitations associated with
making biological inferences based on such measurements.
Second, there has been the challenge of separating “form”
from “function,” and avoiding the common pitfall of assigning physiological functions to autophagy based on its detection (or lack thereof) in a given physiological setting. These
two challenges likely underlie many of the misconceptions in
our historical understanding of the functions of mammalian
autophagy. For example, certain neurodegenerative and myodegenerative diseases were initially believed to result, at least

Figure 1. The Process of Macroautophagy
A portion of cytoplasm, including organelles, is enclosed by a phagophore or isolation membrane to form an autophagosome. The outer membrane of the autophagosome subsequently fuses with the lysosome, and the internal material is degraded in the autolysosome. In yeast, autophagosomes are generated from
the preautophagosomal structure (PAS), which has not yet been identified in mammalian cells. A partial list of treatments and reagents that modulate autophagy
are indicated. Notably, lithium may also inhibit autophagy through mTOR activation. Atg proteins that have thus far been identified on isolation membranes
include ULK1/2, Atg5, Beclin 1, LC3, Atg12, Atg13, Atg14, Atg16L1, FIP200, and Atg101.

in part, from increased autophagy (based on microscopic
visualization of increased numbers of early intermediates in
the pathway) when, in reality, the accumulation of early intermediates in such diseases likely represents a block in later
stages of the autophagy pathway (Levine and Kroemer, 2008;
Mizushima et al., 2008; Rubinsztein, 2006). Autophagy, a
common morphological feature in dying cells, was also often
erroneously presumed to be a cell death pathway, whereas it
now seems clear that one of its major functions is to fight to
keep cells alive under stressful “life-threatening” conditions
(Kroemer and Levine, 2008).
These historical challenges in mammalian autophagy research
have been partially overcome by applying advances in the elucidation of autophagy’s molecular mechanisms to the development of new methods in autophagy research. Accordingly,
within the past decade, numerous new techniques have been
developed both (1) to monitor autophagy as a dynamic process
and (2) to modulate autophagy in order to probe its functions in
a given cellular process. The aim of this Primer is to provide a
critical overview of currently available techniques in mammalian
autophagy research and the limitations in their interpretation.
More detailed information on each technique can also be found
in other reviews (Klionsky et al., 2008a; Mizushima, 2004; Mizushima and Yoshimori, 2007; Rubinsztein et al., 2009).
The Primer’s Primer on Autophagy
Autophagy is a general term for processes by which cytoplasmic materials including organelles reach lysosomes for degradation (Levine and Kroemer, 2008; Mizushima et al., 2008;
Rubinsztein, 2006). Among the three types of autophagy
314  Cell 140, February 5, 2010 ©2010 Elsevier Inc.

(macroautophagy, microautophagy, and chaperone-mediated
autophagy), the most extensively studied is macroautophagy.
Chaperone-mediated autophagy involves the direct translocation of cytosolic proteins across the lysosomal membrane,
which requires protein unfolding by chaperone proteins.
Microautophagy involves inward invagination of lysosomal
membrane, which delivers a small portion of cytoplasm into
the lysosomal lumen.
Macroautophagy (simply referred to as autophagy hereafter)
is the pathway that will be the focus of this Primer. This pathway is conserved from yeast to mammals, and is mediated by a
special organelle termed the autophagosome. Upon induction,
a small vesicular sac called the isolation membrane or phagophore elongates and subsequently encloses a portion of cytoplasm, which results in the formation of a double-membraned
structure, the autophagosome (Figures 1 and 2). Then, the
outer membrane of the autophagosome fuses with a lysosome
(to form an autolysosome), leading to the degradation of the
enclosed materials together with the inner autophagosomal
membrane. The endosome can also fuse with the autophagosome (to form an amphisome) before fusion with the lysosome.
Amino acids and other small molecules that are generated by
autophagic degradation are delivered back to the cytoplasm
for recycling or energy production. The methods described
below detect different stages of the autophagy pathway (e.g.,
early autophagosome, autolysosome, autophagic degradation
products) and should be used coordinately with each other to
determine whether an increase in intermediates in the pathway
represents a true increase in autophagic degradation or rather,
a block in the completion of the autophagic pathway (Figures
3 and 4).
Under physiological conditions, autophagy has a number of
vital roles such as maintenance of the amino acid pool during
starvation, preimplantation development, prevention of neurodegeneration, antiaging, tumor suppression, clearance of
intracellular microbes, and regulation of innate and adaptive
immunity (Cecconi and Levine, 2008; Deretic and Levine, 2009;
Levine and Kroemer, 2008; Mizushima et al., 2008; Rubinsztein, 2006). One of the characteristic features of autophagy
is its dynamic regulation; cellular autophagic activity is usually low under basal conditions, but can be markedly upregulated by numerous stimuli. The most well-known inducer of
autophagy is nutrient starvation, both in cultured cells and in
intact organisms, ranging from yeast to mammals. Besides
starvation, autophagy can also be activated by other physiological stress stimuli (e.g., hypoxia, energy depletion, endoplasmic reticulum stress, high temperature, and high-density
conditions), hormonal stimulation, pharmacological agents
(e.g., rapamycin and other compounds discussed below),
innate immune signals, and in diseases such as bacterial, viral,
and parasitic infections, acute pancreatitis, heart disease, and
protein aggregopathies. Conversely, autophagy suppression is
also often associated with certain diseases, including a subset
of cancers, neurodegenerative disorders, infectious diseases,
and inflammatory bowel disorders, and a decline in autophagy
function is a common feature of aging. Given this strong association between autophagy and different physiological and
pathophysiological processes, there is an increasing need for

scientific methods in autophagy research that reliably determine (1) whether autophagy is present, upregulated, or suppressed in a given biological context and (2) whether (and how)
basal autophagy and/or modified autophagy contribute mechanistically to the physiological or pathophysiological process
under investigation.
The execution of autophagy involves a set of evolutionarily
conserved gene products, known as the Atg proteins, that are
required for the formation of the isolation membrane and the
autophagosome (herein referred to as the “autophagic machinery”) (Table 1). The process of autophagosome formation
involves two major steps: nucleation and elongation of the isolation membrane. The ULK/Atg1 kinase complex, the autophagyspecific PI3-kinase complex, and PI(3)P effectors and their
related proteins are important for the nucleation step, whereas
the Atg12- and LC3/Atg8-conjugation systems are important
for the elongation step. In addition, other proteins required for
autophagosome-lysosomal fusion, lysosomal acidification, and
lysosomal digestion, and regulatory signals that integrate environmental cues with the autophagic machinery are involved in
autophagy. Details of the molecular regulation and machinery
of autophagy have been reviewed elsewhere (He and Klionsky,
2009; Longatti and Tooze, 2009). In mammalian cells, most of the
Atg proteins are observed on isolation membranes (e.g., ULK1/2,
Atg13, FIP200, Atg101, Beclin 1, Atg14, LC3, Atg12, Atg16L1) but
not on complete autophagosomes (Longatti and Tooze, 2009)
(Figure 1, Table 1). To date, only microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3), a mammalian homolog of yeast Atg8,
is known to exist on autophagosomes, and therefore, this protein serves as a widely used marker for autophagosomes (Figures 1 and 4) (Kabeya et al., 2000; Mizushima et al., 2004). The
identification of the autophagic machinery has greatly facilitated
the detection of autophagy (through LC3-based biochemical
and microscopic assays), as well as the ability to experimentally manipulate the autophagy pathway (through knockout or
knockdown of autophagy genes or the expression of dominant
negative autophagy proteins). The autophagy pathway can also
be manipulated with agents that regulate autophagosome formation or subsequent degradation steps (Figure 1).
Monitoring Cellular Autophagic Activity
A common misconception is the notion that increased numbers
of autophagosomes in cells invariably correspond to increased
cellular autophagic activity. Given that the autophagosome is
an intermediate structure in a dynamic pathway, the number of
autophagosomes observed at any specific time point is a function of the balance between the rate of their generation and the
rate of their conversion into autolysosomes. Thus, autophagosome accumulation may represent either autophagy induction
or, alternatively, suppression of steps in the autophagy pathway downstream of autophagosome formation. For example,
compared to basal levels of autophagy (Figure 3A), autophagy
activation is expected to result in an increase in the numbers of
all autophagic structures (i.e., isolation membranes, autophagosomes, and autolysosomes) (Figure 3B). If any step upstream
of autophagosome formation is blocked, the numbers of all
autophagic structures are decreased (Figure 3C). In contrast,
the blockade of any step downstream of autophagosome

(A) Under normal conditions, basal autophagy occurs.
(B) When autophagy is induced, for example by starvation, there is an increase in all types of autophagic structures.

formation increases the number of autophagosomes while
decreasing the number of autolysosomes (Figure 3D). Notably,
in two physiologically opposite scenarios, autophagy activation (and increased autophagic degradation) (Figure 3B) and
blockade of a downstream step in autophagy (and decreased
autophagic degradation) (Figure 3D), there is an increase in the
number of autophagosomes. Therefore, the simple determination of numbers of autophagosomes is insufficient for an overall estimation of autophagic activity. Rather, different methods
often need to be used in concert to distinguish between basal
levels of autophagy, induction of autophagy, suppression
of upstream steps of autophagy, and suppression of downstream steps of autophagy. The term “autophagic flux” is used
to denote the dynamic process of autophagosome synthesis,
delivery of autophagic substrates to the lysosome, and degradation of autophagic substrates inside the lysosome and is

a more reliable indicator of autophagic activity than measurements of autophagosome numbers. In subsequent sections,
we will discuss different methods for monitoring the number of
autophagosomes and for monitoring autophagic flux.
Monitoring the Number of Autophagosomes

ization of LC3, and biochemical detection of the membrane-associated form
of LC3.
Electron Microscopy
The most traditional method is electron
microscopy, and in fact, mammalian
autophagy was originally discovered
in the late 1950s by electron microscopists studying the lysosome. At the
ultrastructural level, an autophagosome
is defined as a double-membraned
structure containing undigested cytoplasmic contents, which has not fused
with a lysosome (Figures 2 and 4A).
Autophagosomes often enclose intracellular organelles such as mitochondria and fragments of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). As this definition
is straightforward, it is usually easy to
identify autophagosomes, or at least
those organelles that envelop cellular
contents. It is less clear how to interpret double-membraned structures that specifically enwrap
intracellular pathogens: the life cycle of some pathogens may
involve transit through autophagic-like intermediate structures (without eventual delivery to the lysosome), whereas
in other cases, intracellular pathogens are truly captured by
the autophagy pathway for lysosomal degradation. Another
consideration is that the classic definition of an autophagosome includes the visualization of different cellular contents
inside the double-membraned structure. Although this may

This complex is negatively regulated by mTORC1 in a nutrient-dependent manner. Upon autophagy induction, this complex translocates to early
autophagic structures. Although FIP200 and Atg13 are known to be phosphorylated by ULK1, physiologically relevant substrates remain unknown.
FIP200 and Atg101 may have functions similar to yeast Atg17, 29, and 31, although they show no sequence similarity with these proteins.
b
Beclin 1 is negatively regulated by Bcl-2 through direct binding. This complex produces PI(3)P, most likely on the ER membrane. Vps34, p150,
and Beclin 1 are shared with the UVRAG complex, which seems to function in the late endocytic pathway. Rubicon negatively regulates autophagosome-lysosome fusion through interaction with the UVRAG complex.
c
DFCP1 forms an “omegasome” on the ER, where other Atg proteins are assembled. Atg9, WIPIs, and VMP1 are present on autophagic membrane. Atg9 also exists in other compartments such as endosomes and the Golgi apparatus.
d
The Atg12-Atg5-Atg16(L) dimer is important for LC3/Atg8-phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) conjugation. This complex is present on the outer side of
the isolation membrane and is essential for proper elongation of the isolation membrane.
e
The formation of LC3/Atg8-PE conjugates and their deconjugation by Atg4 is important for isolation membrane elongation and/or complete
closure. LC3/Atg8 is present on both inner and outer membranes of the autophagosome, and also serves as an adaptor for selective substrates
such as p62, NBR1, and the yeast mitophagy protein, Atg32.

be the case in “bulk autophagy,” there is increasing evidence
for organelle-specific autophagy, including pexophagy,
mitophagy, ribophagy, and reticulophagy (van der Vaart et
al., 2008). Thus, the morphological criteria used to identify
an autophagosome may need to be revised to incorporate
recent evidence for pathogen-specific and organelle-specific
autophagy in mammalian cells.
In contrast to an autophagosome containing cellular cargo
(which is usually easy to identify), the distinction of autolysosomes from other cellular membranous compartments is often
more difficult. The autolysosome is a hybrid organelle generated by the fusion of an autophagosome and a lysosome (an
endosome can also be involved), which has a single limiting
membrane and contains cytoplasmic materials at various

stages of degradation. At early stages, the inside materials
can be recognized as having originated from cytoplasm. However, if degradation proceeds too far, it is not easy to determine whether the inside materials are of intracellular origin.
Furthermore, it is often difficult to distinguish autolysosomes
from endocytic compartments (heterophagic vacuoles) or from
certain other vacuoles/structures of unknown origin. In particular, vacuoles with no or scarce inside materials should not
be judged as “autophagic” structures. Other typical examples
of misinterpretation are discussed in more detail in another
review (Eskelinen, 2008). Thus, although electron microscopy
is a powerful tool, it is not a perfect method and it is limited in
its potential for application to functional studies as described
below.

Fluorescence Microscopy
The assessment of autophagosome number by electron
microscopy requires considerable specialized expertise,
and is becoming increasingly replaced by light microscopic
and biochemical methods that are more widely accessible to
researchers in different fields. As noted above, the mammalian autophagy protein, LC3, is a marker of autophagosomes
(Figures 1 and 4B). Among the four LC3 isoforms, LC3B is
most widely used. Soon after synthesis, nascent LC3 is pro318  Cell 140, February 5, 2010 ©2010 Elsevier Inc.

cessed at its C terminus by Atg4 and becomes LC3-I, which
has a glycine residue at the C-terminal end. LC3-I is subsequently conjugated with phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) to
become LC3-II (LC3-PE) by a ubiquitination-like enzymatic
reaction. In contrast to the cytoplasmic localization of LC3-I,
LC3-II associates with both the outer and inner membranes
of the autophagosome (Figure 4B). After fusion with the lysosome, LC3 on the outer membrane is cleaved off by Atg4
and LC3 on the inner membrane is degraded by lysosomal
enzymes, resulting in very low LC3 content in the autolysosome. Thus, endogenous LC3 or GFP-LC3 is visualized by
fluorescence microscopy either as a diffuse cytoplasmic pool
or as punctate structures that primarily represent autophagosomes (Figure 5A).
Although the number of punctate LC3 or GFP-LC3 structures per cell is usually an accurate measure of autophagosome number, this assay has some potential experimental
pitfalls. First, there is potential for subjectivity, and a uniform
approach needs to be established and applied by the investigator, both with respect to the method of quantitation and
the criteria for defining a “puncta.” The number of punctate
structures can be counted visually (by an observer blinded
to experimental condition) or automatically determined using
computerized software image analysis programs (e.g., Top
Hat algorithm of MetaMorph version 7.0 by Molecular Devices,
and G-Count by G-Angstrom). Although puncta number is
markedly increased after autophagy induction, small numbers of punctae are also observed even under normal conditions (Figure 5A). Therefore, “percentage of cells with GFPLC3 punctae” is not an appropriate indicator (theoretically, it
should be 100% in most cell types), unless a clear threshold
can be established that effectively distinguishes “autophagy
active” and “autophagy inactive” states; if so, results should
then be expressed as the “percentage of cells with more than
a certain number of punctae.” In general, it is preferable to
quantify the “average number of GFP-LC3 punctae per cell”
in all cells in the population under evaluation. The “total area
of GFP-LC3 punctae per cell” may also be analyzed with
image analysis software, but in such a case, it is particularly
important to rule out experimental artifacts due to the formation of large GFP-LC3 aggregates (see below).
A second potential pitfall with the detection of LC3 or GFPLC3 punctate structures as a method to monitor autophagosome numbers is the observation that GFP-LC3, and probably even endogenous LC3, can be easily aggregated if
overexpressed or coexpressed with other aggregate-prone
proteins (Kuma et al., 2007). GFP-LC3 aggregates are often
indistinguishable from true autophagosomes by fluorescence
microscopy. However, certain precautions can be exercised
to reduce the possibility of GFP-LC3 aggregation. The use of
stable GFP-LC3 transformants is highly recommended, so
that one can select clones that express appropriate levels of
GFP-LC3 without artificial aggregation. When the GFP-LC3
construct is used in transient transfection experiments, caution should be exercised to avoid high levels of expression
that result in artificial aggregation. Furthermore, it is possible to experimentally distinguish between nonspecific GFPLC3 incorporation into aggregates versus GFP-LC3 incor-

Biochemical Assays
In addition to its utility in fluorescence microscopy assays, mammalian LC3, yeast Atg8, and certain other autophagy
LC3 is also useful in biochemical assays to assess autopha- genes may be transcriptionally upregulated in response to
gosome numbers. The conversion from endogenous LC3-I stress conditions that induce autophagy (He and Klionsky,
Cell 140, February 5, 2010 ©2010 Elsevier Inc.  319

2009), there is no clear evidence that autophagic activity per
se is transcriptionally upregulated. Moreover, Atg proteins
are constitutively expressed in sufficient amounts, and their
posttranslational modifications and/or associations with other
members of the autophagic machinery, rather than regulation
of their expression levels, seems to be critical for their activity in the autophagy pathway. Therefore, Atg mRNA or protein
expression levels are not considered appropriate indicators for
monitoring autophagy.
Monitoring Autophagic Flux
The methods described in the above section are useful to evaluate the number of cellular autophagosomes, which generally—
but not always—is an indicator of the level of cellular autophagic
activity. As discussed above (and illustrated in Figure 3), the
accumulation of autophagosomes is not always indicative of
autophagy induction and may represent either the increased
generation of autophagosomes and/or a block in autophagosomal maturation and the completion of the autophagy pathway. A similar concern is also true for the measurement of LC3
-II. For example, if cells are cultured with chloroquine, an agent
that impairs lysosomal acidification, LC3-II accumulates even
under normal (nonstarved) conditions because turnover of LC3
-II by basal autophagy is blocked (Figure 6A). Thus, one cannot
distinguish between bona fide induction of autophagy (e.g., by
starvation) and impairment of autophagolysosomal maturation
simply by measuring autophagosome numbers (e.g., by electron microscopy or by light microscopy detection of LC3 or
GFP-LC3 puncta) or by measuring levels of LC3-II (by immunoblot analysis). In most experimental settings, it is necessary
to distinguish whether autophagosome accumulation is due to
autophagy induction or rather a block in downstream steps, by
performing “autophagic flux” assays (Figures 4D–4H and 6B)
that distinguish between these two possibilities. It should be
noted that the quantitation of relative numbers of autophagosomes and autolysosomes observed by electron microscopy
can help discriminate between autophagy activation (in which
both autophagosomes and autolysosomes are increased in
numbers) and a block in autophagosome maturation (which
is associated with an increase in autophagosome numbers
without a change in autolysosome numbers) (Figure 4A). However, electron microscopy does not provide direct information
about lysosomal degradation of autophagic substrates and,
therefore, we do not formally classify it as an “autophagic flux”
assay.
LC3 Turnover Assay
One of the principal methods in current use to measure
autophagic flux is the monitoring of LC3 turnover, which is
based on the observation that LC3-II is degraded in autolysosomes. As described above, if cells are treated with lysosomotropic reagents such as ammonium chloride, chloroquine, or
bafilomycin A1, which inhibit acidification inside the lysosome
or inhibit autophagosome-lysosome fusion, or with inhibitors
of lysosomal proteases such as E64d and pepstatin A, the
degradation of LC3-II is blocked, resulting in the accumulation
of LC3-II (Tanida et al., 2005). Accordingly, the differences in
the amount of LC3-II between samples in the presence and
absence of lysosomal inhibitors represent the amount of LC3
320  Cell 140, February 5, 2010 ©2010 Elsevier Inc.

that is delivered to lysosomes for degradation (i.e., autophagic
flux) (Figure 4D) (Klionsky et al., 2008a; Mizushima and Yoshimori, 2007; Rubinsztein et al., 2009). For example, levels of
LC3-II are increased by treatment with chloroquine even under
nonstarvation conditions (compare lanes 1 and 2, Figure 6B).
However, the difference in LC3-II levels in the presence and
absence of chloroquine is larger under starvation conditions
(compare lanes 3 and 4, Figure 6B), indicating that autophagic
flux is increased during starvation.
Although the LC3 turnover assay is theoretically straightforward, in some experimental settings, it can be challenging to
obtain meaningful results and reliably detect autophagic flux.
This may in part reflect the highly sensitive nature of the assay;
in particular, a high rate of flux can be detected even during
basal conditions (for example, in HeLa cells grown in normal
media), which makes it difficult in such settings to detect
additional changes in LC3 turnover upon autophagy upregulation. Therefore, we propose that the measurement of LC3
turnover should not be the single “sine qua non” for evaluating
autophagic flux. Rather, it should be viewed as a reliable indicator of autophagic flux in some settings, but in other settings,
autophagic flux may need to be measured by a combination of
other techniques (described below) that will yield more useful
information.
Degradation of LC3 and Selective Substrates
As LC3 is degraded by autophagy, the disappearance of total
LC3 is paradoxically a good indicator of autophagic flux (Figure 4E). Even the amount of LC3-II, which increases transiently
upon induction of autophagy, is decreased after longer periods
of autophagy activation (e.g., more than 2 hr of starvation) (Mizushima and Yoshimori, 2007). Similarly, cells under starvation
exhibit a large number of GFP-LC3 puncta, but the cytoplasmic
GFP-LC3 signal and the GFP-LC3 nuclear signal (the significance of which is unknown) are both reduced after autophagy
induction (Figure 5A). This reduction of total GFP-LC3 expression can be quantitatively and sensitively monitored by flow
cytometry (Shvets et al., 2008). Thus, the amount of total cellular LC3 that can be quantitated by immunoblot analysis or flow
cytometry (or observed qualitatively by fluorescence microscopy) inversely correlates with autophagic flux. One important
implication of this relates to the interpretation of LC3 staining
in histological studies. Increased LC3 staining is sometimes
interpreted as evidence for autophagy activation; however,
such an observation may instead indicate that autophagy is
suppressed, resulting in decreased autolysosomal degradation of LC3.
Besides LC3, levels of other autophagy substrates can be
used to monitor autophagic flux. Classically, autophagy was
considered to be a random degradation system, but recent
studies have revealed that several specific substrates are preferentially degraded by autophagy, of which the best studied
example is p62 (also known as SQSTM1/sequestome 1). p62 is
selectively incorporated into autophagosomes through direct
binding to LC3 and is efficiently degraded by autophagy (Figure 4E) (Bjørkøy et al., 2005); thus, the total cellular expression levels of p62 inversely correlate with autophagic activity.
For example, a starvation-induced reduction in p62 levels is
not observed in autophagy-deficient cells, and instead, p62

accumulates (Mizushima and Yoshimori, 2007). In numerous
studies, the measurement of cellular p62 appears to correlate
well with other parameters of autophagic flux, and overall, this
assay seems quite promising. However, it should be noted
that it is not yet clear whether p62 is degraded solely through
autophagy or partially through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Moreover, p62, as well as LC3, can be transcriptionally
regulated during autophagy (He and Klionsky, 2009; Nakaso
et al., 2004), which may confound the interpretation of p62
and LC3 levels as indicators of autophagic flux. Given these
potential limitations, we recommend that the measurement of
autophagic substrate levels be used in combination with other
independent experiments to evaluate autophagic flux.
Delivery of mRFP-GFP-LC3 to the Lysosome
Another useful assay to measure autophagic flux is based on
the concept of lysosomal quenching of GFP in GFP-labeled
autophagic substrates such as LC3 (Figure 4F). GFP is a stably
folded protein and relatively resistant to lysosomal proteases.
However, the low pH inside the lysosome quenches the fluorescent signal of GFP, which makes it difficult to trace the delivery of GFP-LC3 to lysosomes; indeed, most GFP-LC3 punctate
signals do not colocalize with lysosomes (Bampton et al., 2005;
Kabeya et al., 2000). In contrast, RFP (and other red fluorescent
proteins, such as mCherry) exhibits more stable fluorescence
in acidic compartments (Katayama et al., 2008), and mRFPLC3 can readily be detected in autolysosomes (Table 2). By
exploiting the difference in the nature of these two fluorescent
proteins (i.e., lysosomal quenching of GFP fluorescence versus lysosomal stability of RFP fluorescence), autophagic flux
can be morphologically traced with an mRFP-GFP-LC3 tandem construct (Figures 4F and 5C) (Kimura et al., 2007). With
this novel construct, autophagosomes and autolysosomes are
labeled with yellow (i.e., mRFP and GFP) and red (i.e., mRFP
only) signals, respectively. If autophagic flux is increased, both
yellow and red punctae are increased; however, if autophagosome maturation into autolysosomes is blocked, only yellow
punctae are increased without a concomitant increase in red
punctae. Although this assay can be used as an indicator of
autophagic flux, it does not provide precisely the same information as other flux assays that directly measure endpoints of

lysosomal degradation. This method depends on the acidification and degradation capacity of the lysosome. It is, therefore,
sometimes possible that autolysosomes are observed as yellow, depending on the activity of lysosomal enzymes and the
speed at which the acidic lysosomal pH quenches the GFP
signal.
GFP-LC3 Cleavage Assay
Although GFP fluorescence is quenched by the acidic pH
environment inside the lysosome, GFP is still detectable by
immunoblotting and is more stable than the GFP-LC3 fusion
protein (which is partially degraded upon reaching the lysosome, resulting in the appearance of a free GFP fragment) (Gao
et al., 2008; Hosokawa et al., 2006). Therefore, another assay
to measure autophagic flux is the detection of the free GFP
fragment that is generated by degradation of GFP-LC3 in the
autolysosome by immunoblotting with an anti-GFP antibody
(Figure 4G). Although this assay has been fairly widely used in
yeast cells expressing GFP-Atg8, experience is more limited
in mammalian cells. In some cases, depending on the activity
and acidity of lysosomes (which may differ between cell types),
this assay may not be successful as a result of GFP degradation in the autolysosome.
Long-Lived Protein Degradation
One of the most traditional methods to evaluate autophagic
flux, developed in the 1970s, is the measurement of bulk degradation of long-lived proteins (Figure 4H). In this assay, cells
are cultured with isotope-labeled amino acids (usually [14C]- or
[3H]-valine or leucine) for a long duration (several hours to several days) to label long-lived proteins, followed by a short incubation period without isotope-labeled amino acids to wash out
radiolabeled short-lived proteins, which are primarily degraded
by the proteasome. After treatment with an autophagy-inducing stimulus, the cellular release of degraded proteins (measured as tricholoracetic acid-soluble radioactivity in the culture
supernatant) is quantified. This may be the most quantitative
assay, because it provides a precise numerical readout that
reflects the fate of all long-lived cellular proteins and avoids
the pitfalls associated with measuring a single autophagic substrate. To ensure that one is truly measuring the contribution
of “autophagic degradation” (versus other potential pathways
Cell 140, February 5, 2010 ©2010 Elsevier Inc.  321

that may contribute to long-lived protein degradation), it is standard practice to compare degradation rates between samples
cultured in the presence or absence of an autophagy inhibitor
(e.g., 3-methyladenine [3-MA]). One weakness of this assay is
that its interpretation depends entirely on the specificity and
efficiency of the autophagy inhibitors used (discussed below).
Cautions
As reviewed in this section, several different assays are presently available to monitor autophagic flux, including the LC3
turnover assay, measurements of total levels of autophagic
substrates (e.g., LC3, GFP-LC3, or p62), analysis of the mRFPGFP-LC3 color change, measurement of free GFP generated
from GFP-LC3, and measurement of lysosome-dependent
long-lived protein degradation. The utility and limitations
of each of these assays may vary somewhat in different cell
types and in different experimental contexts; therefore, we
propose that the choice of assays used to measure autophagic
flux be “custom-tailored” accordingly. As the limitations of
the individual assays are largely nonoverlapping, we recommend using a combination of different assays to measure
autophagic flux. In this manner, it should be possible to reliably monitor autophagic flux (and thereby autophagic activity)
in most mammalian tissue culture settings. Unfortunately, only
a limited number of methods have been reported for monitoring autophagic flux in vivo (Iwai-Kanai et al., 2008). Although
p62 levels have been reported to increase in the tissues of
autophagy-deficient mice (Komatsu et al., 2007), it is not yet
known how p62 levels correlate with autophagy induction in
vivo. Similar to the GFP-LC3 transgenic mice that have been a
useful tool for monitoring autophagosome numbers in vivo, it
should be possible to generate GFP-RFP-LC3 transgenic mice
that can be used to monitor autophagic flux in vivo. A more
difficult, but extremely important, challenge will be to develop
assays to measure autophagic flux in patients (and in blood
and tissue samples from patients).
Inhibition of Autophagic Activity
To fully understand a given biological process, it is usually critical to perform experiments to modulate the activity of the process. One of the most serious problems in current autophagy
research is that we still lack highly specific autophagy inhibitors and activators. Nonetheless, several modulators are now
available, and genetic manipulation techniques have also provided powerful tools (Figure 1) (Rubinsztein et al., 2007). In
this section and the subsequent section, we discuss different
pharmacological and genetic approaches to inhibit and activate autophagy, respectively.
As autophagosome formation requires class III PI3-kinase
activity, one of the most commonly used pharmacological
approaches to inhibit autophagy in vitro involves the use of
PI3-kinase inhibitors such as wortmannin, LY294002, or 3-MA
(Blommaart et al., 1997; Itakura et al., 2008; Matsunaga et al.,
2009). However, it should be noted that all of these reagents
can inhibit both class I PI3-kinase activity (which inhibits autophagy) as well as class III PI3 kinase activity (which
is required for autophagy) (Knight et al., 2006), and some of
the PI3-kinase inhibitors, such as LY294002 and wortmannin,
also inhibit mTOR (an autophagy-inhibitory molecule) by tar322  Cell 140, February 5, 2010 ©2010 Elsevier Inc.

geting its ATP binding site (Brunn et al., 1996). Moreover, as
PI3-kinases (both class I and class III) regulate diverse cell signaling and membrane trafficking processes, these PI3-kinase
inhibitors are not autophagy specific. Another concern is that
3-MA, which is used at very high concentrations to inhibit
autophagy (usually 10 mM), can target other kinases and affect
other cellular processes such as glycogen metabolism, lysosomal acidification (Caro et al., 1988), endocytosis (Punnonen
et al., 1994), and the mitochondrial permeability transition (Xue
et al., 2002). Indeed, 3-MA can suppress proteolysis even in
Atg5-deficient cells, suggesting that its effects on protein degradation extend beyond its role in autophagy inhibition (Mizushima et al., 2001).
Although PI3-kinase inhibitors block the formation of
autophagosomes, the other major pharmacological inhibitors
in experimental use block later stages of autophagy (Figure 1).
Microtubule-disrupting agents (e.g., vinblastine and nocodazole) inhibit autophagosome-lysosome fusion, a step in the
pathway that requires microtubules (Jahreiss et al., 2008;
Kimura et al., 2008). Final degradation of autophagic cargo
inside autolysosomes can also be inhibited by ammonium chloride, bafilomycin A1, and lysosomal protease inhibitors such as
E64d and pepstatin A (Figure 1). Although bafilomycin A1 was
originally reported to inhibit autophagosome-lysosome fusion
(Yamamoto et al., 1998), a recent study suggests that it primarily affects intralysosomal degradation by inhibiting acidification, at least under certain conditions (Klionsky et al., 2008b).
One major limitation is that disruption of microtubules and
inhibition of lysosomal degradation affect other cellular processes besides autophagy such as mitosis and endocytosis.
Accordingly, as with the PI3-kinase inhibitors, caution needs
to be exercised in interpreting phenotypes observed with such
treatments. Given the lack of specificity of these currently available autophagy inhibitors, we recommend that investigators
avoid drawing conclusions about the functions of autophagy
based upon studies that rely uniquely upon the pharmacological inhibition of autophagy. Rather, pharmacological studies
should be combined with genetic approaches to more specifically inhibit the autophagy pathway.
More specific inhibition of the autophagy pathway can be
achieved by knockout or knockdown of different ATG genes.
To date, autophagy deficiency/reduction has been confirmed
in cells lacking Atg3 (Sou et al., 2008), Atg5 (Mizushima et al.,
2001), Beclin 1 (Qu et al., 2003; Yue et al., 2003), Atg7 (Komatsu
et al., 2005), Atg9a (Saitoh et al., 2009), Atg16L1 (Cadwell et
al., 2008; Saitoh et al., 2008), FIP200 (Hara et al., 2008) and
Ambra1 (Fimia et al., 2007). The knockout of Atg4C (Mariño
et al., 2007), LC3B (Cann et al., 2007), and ULK1 (Kundu et
al., 2008) results in mild phenotypes in vivo, probably because
related isoforms compensate for the gene deficiency. Therefore, these genes should not be used as first choice RNAi targets for autophagy knockdown experiments (although small
interfering RNA [siRNA] against ULK1 is effective at least in
certain cell types (Chan et al., 2007). Another consideration
with RNAi-mediated approaches to autophagy inhibition is
that certain Atg proteins (e.g., Atg5; Hosokawa et al., 2006) still
function normally in autophagy when present at very low levels; in such cases, RNAi-mediated silencing will require nearly

complete suppression of protein expression to observe effective autophagy inhibition. Thus, when performing autophagy
gene knockdown experiments, we recommend that investigators not only confirm effective knockdown of autophagy protein
expression levels with each siRNA, but also confirm effective
inhibition of the autophagy pathway using a known autophagyinducing stimulus such as starvation.
Another successful approach for genetic inhibition of
autophagy involves the utilization of dominant-negative mutant
autophagy proteins. These include kinase-dead mutants of
ULK1 (ULK1K46N, ULK1K46R, and ULK1K46I) (Chan et al., 2009; Hara
et al., 2008), Atg4BC74A (Fujita et al., 2008a), and the coiled-coil
region of Atg16L1 (Fujita et al., 2008b). In addition, the overexpression of wild-type Atg12 and Atg16L1 (Fujita et al., 2008b)
and a conjugation-defective Atg5 mutant (Atg5K130R) (Pyo et
al., 2005) result in dominant-negative effects. As the effect of
these dominant-negative mutants is sometimes context and/or
cell-type specific, it is important to confirm the inhibitory effect
in each experiment.
Of note, most ATG gene deletions or dominant-negative
mutant autophagy proteins block initiation of autophagosome
formation (Figure 1, Table 1). However, abnormally elongated
membranes are observed in Atg3 knockout cells (Sou et al.,
2008), Atg5 knockout cells (Mizushima et al., 2001; Nishiyama
et al., 2007), and Atg4BC74A-expressing cells (Fujita et al., 2008a),
suggesting that these factors, which belong to the Atg12 and
Atg8/LC3 conjugation systems, may also be important for the
complete closure of autophagosomes (Figure 1).
In theory, autophagy gene knockdown/knockout represents a more specific approach than pharmacological agents
to inhibit autophagy. However, one important cautionary
note is that the Atg proteins may not be entirely specific for
autophagy; they may have autophagy-independent functions,
including a role in cell death, endocytosis, and immunityrelated GTPase trafficking (Kroemer and Levine, 2008; Virgin and Levine, 2009). Moreover, divergent functions for Atg
proteins are suggested by the nonoverlapping phenotypes of
different ATG gene knockout mice. The phenotypes of targeted mutant mice deficient in Atg3 (Sou et al., 2008), Atg5
(Kuma et al., 2004), Atg7 (Komatsu et al., 2005), Atg9a (Saitoh
et al., 2009), and Atg16L1 (Saitoh et al., 2008) are essentially
the same (neonatal lethality), whereas embryonic lethality is
observed in mice deficient in Beclin 1 (Qu et al., 2003; Yue
et al., 2003), FIP200 (Gan et al., 2006), and Ambra1 (Fimia et
al., 2007). Thus, given the possibility that any individual Atg
protein may also have autophagy-independent functions, a
combination of different genetic approaches (i.e., targeting
different genes that act at different steps in the autophagy
pathway) is advised to increase the likelihood that observed
phenotypes in the setting of autophagy gene knockdown/
knockout are truly due to inhibition of autophagic activity.
Activation of Autophagic Activity
There is growing interest in activators of autophagy, not only for
research purposes but also for potential therapeutic purposes.
Similar to the case with autophagy inhibitors, there are several
different methods to activate autophagy, but they lack complete specificity for the autophagy pathway. As stated above,

the most potent known physiological inducer of autophagy
is starvation, which exerts effects both in vitro and in vivo
(withdrawal of amino acids is more potent than withdrawal of
serum or growth factors in vitro) (Figure 1). In most cell lines,
autophagy induction can be observed within 1 hr of amino acid
withdrawal; a notable exception is that certain tumor cell lines
may be resistant to starvation-induced autophagy. Another
approach to activate autophagy is through the modulation of
nutrient-sensing signaling pathways. The best target is mTOR,
which is a potent suppressor of autophagy. Rapamycin, an
inhibitor of mTOR, and its analogs, such as CCI-779, activate
autophagy both in vitro and in vivo (Ravikumar et al., 2004).
One limitation of rapamycin in mammalian cells is that it seems
to only exert partial effects at least with respect to autophagy
induction and 4E-BP1 dephosphorylation (Thoreen et al.,
2009). Recently developed ATP-competitive inhibitors of mTOR
such as Torin1 (Thoreen et al., 2009) and PP242 (Feldman et
al., 2009) show stronger inhibitory activity and may have more
promise as autophagy-inducing agents. Of note, starvation and
mTOR inhibition are not specific inducers of autophagy; these
treatments affect a wide range of cellular responses, particularly protein synthesis and cellular metabolism, in addition to
autophagy activation.
Several mTOR-independent autophagy activators have also
been reported (Figure 1). Lithium induces autophagy through
inhibition of inositol monophosphatase (which is mTOR-independent), but it also attenuates autophagy through glycogen
synthase kinase-3β inhibition (which is mTOR-dependent)
(Sarkar et al., 2008); therefore, if used to activate autophagy,
lithium should always be combined with mTOR inhibitors. BH3
mimetics such as ABT737 (and similar compounds in pre-clinical development) induce autophagy by competitively disrupting
the interaction between Beclin 1 and Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL (Maiuri et
al., 2007). Trehalose and small-molecule enhancers of rapamycin (SMERs) also induce autophagy by mechanisms that are
not well understood (Sarkar et al., 2007a; Sarkar et al., 2007b).
Two screens of FDA-approved compounds identified additional agents that induce autophagy in an mTOR-independent
manner, including fluspirilene, trifluoperazine, pimozide, nicardipine, niguildipine, loperamide, and amiodarone (Zhang et al.,
2007), and verapamil, minoxidil, and clonidine (Williams et al.,
2008). To achieve maximal autophagy induction either in vitro
(or in vivo in patients), it may be desirable to combine reagents
that act in an mTOR-independent manner with rapamycin or
other mTOR inhibitors to achieve additive effects in autophagy
activation.
Concluding Remarks
We have discussed currently available techniques and methods to monitor and modulate autophagy in mammalian cells.
There is no perfect method to measure autophagosome numbers or to measure autophagic flux, and no perfect method to
specifically activate or inhibit the autophagy pathway. Accordingly, it should be emphasized that there is no single “gold
standard” for methods to monitor or modulate autophagic
activity. Rather, one should consider the use of several different concurrent methods (with nonoverlapping limitations)
to accurately assess the status and functions of autophagic

activity in any given biological setting. With further elucidation
of the molecular mechanisms of autophagy, it is anticipated
that better assays will be developed to monitor autophagy and
more specific agents will be developed to modulate autophagy.
Such advances will be critical for an improved understanding
of the biological functions of autophagy and for the successful
development of therapies that modulate autophagy for use in
clinical medicine.
