Prediction of 1‑octanol solubilities
using data from the Open Notebook Science
Challenge
Michael A. Buonaiuto and Andrew S. I. D. Lang*

Abstract 
Background:  1-Octanol solubility is important in a variety of applications involving pharmacology and environmental chemistry. Current models are linear in nature and often require foreknowledge of either melting point or aqueous
solubility. Here we extend the range of applicability of 1-octanol solubility models by creating a random forest model
that can predict 1-octanol solubilities directly from structure.
Results:  We created a random forest model using CDK descriptors that has an out-of-bag (OOB) R2 value of 0.66 and
an OOB mean squared error of 0.34. The model has been deployed for general use as a Shiny application.
Conclusion:  The 1-octanol solubility model provides reasonably accurate predictions of the 1-octanol solubility of
organic solutes directly from structure. The model was developed under Open Notebook Science conditions which
makes it open, reproducible, and as useful as possible.

Background
The solubility of organic compounds in 1-octanol is
important because of its direct relationship to the partition coefficient logP used in pharmacology and environmental chemistry. Current models that can be used
to predict 1-octanol solubility include group contribution methods [1] and often include melting point as a
descriptor [2–4]. The most recent model by Admire and
Yalkowsky [4] gives a very useful rule of thumb to predict
molar 1-octanol solubility from just the melting point
Log Soct = 0.50 − 0.01 · (mp − 25),

(1)

where the compound melting point mp is in °C for compounds that are solid at room temperature and is taken
to be 25 for liquids. Abraham and Acree [5] refined
Admire and Yalkowsky’s model by appending the melting
point term to their linear free energy relationship (LFER)
model

where E is the solute excess molar refractivity in units of
(cm3/mol)/10, S is the solute dipolarity/polarizability, A
and B are the overall or summation hydrogen bond acidity and basicity, and V is the McGowan characteristic volume in units of (cm3/mol)/100. The A·B term was added
to deal with the solute–solute interactions. The coefficients were found using linear regression against the solubilities of solutes with known Abraham descriptors with
the following result:

Log Soct = 0.480 − 0.355 · E − 0.203 · S + 1.521 · A

an open data, crowdsourcing research project that collects and measures the solubilities of organic compounds
in organic solvents created by Jean-Claude Bradley and
Cameron Neylon. The challenge is, in turn, part of JeanClaude Bradley’s UsefulChem program, an open drug discovery project that uses open notebook science [7].

Procedure
The 1-octanol solubility data in this paper were extracted
from the Open Notebook Science Challenge solubility
database [8]. We removed all items that were marked
“DONOTUSE.” For compounds with multiple solubility values that included values listed in the Abraham
and Acree paper, we kept only the solubility values that
were listed in the Abraham and Acree paper. If no Abraham and Acree paper value was available, then we kept
the Raevsky, Perlovich, and Schaper value instead. In the
rare case that two Abraham and Acree (or Raevsky, Perlovich, and Schaper) paper values were listed for a single chemspider ID (CSID), we kept the higher of the two
values.
The collection and curation process left us with 261
data points to model, see Additional file 1. The structures
in our dataset are not very diverse and can be characterized, in general, as relatively small organic compounds
with 1-octanol solubility values between 0.01 and 1.00 M,
see Figs. 1, 2, and 3.

Two features about the chemical space are immediately
apparent. Firstly, the dataset has 50 carboxylic acids which
is a common feature for both Abraham and Acree datasets
and the Open Notebook Science Challenge dataset where
the primary focus is on measuring solubilities for the same
compound in several non-aqueous solvents. While common in non-aqueous solubility studies, sometimes one
does have to consider dimerization for carboxylic acids [9].
Secondly, there are only 50 compounds that have a single
Lipinski’s Rules failure (all the rest having zero failures),
suggesting the dataset could be characterized as drug-like.
Principal component analysis (using the prcomp function with scale = T) and cluster analysis was performed
on the dataset of 259 compounds with 86 CDK descriptors using R. The optimal number of clusters was determined to be 2 by using silhouette analysis (using the pam
function) on a series ranging from 2 to 20 clusters. The
silhouettes had an average width of 0.74 for 2 clusters;
almost double the next closest value [10]. The clusters
are shown in Fig.  4 below with the x and y axes corresponding to the first and second principal components
respectively. The first two principal components explain
36 % of the variance. The first cluster (red) is typified by
compounds without hydrogen bond acceptors and with
ALogP >1.56 and with TopoPSA <26.48; 128 out of 157
compounds match this criteria. The blue cluster is more
chemically diverse than the red cluster but even so 75

Results and discussion
Modeling

A Random Forest Model is a compilation of uncorrelated
decision trees used to choose the best case among many.

Our model used 86 variables in its calculation. In general, the less correlated that the variables are, the better
the results that will occur from a random forest model. A
higher strength of each individual tree also improves the
accuracy of the final model—“The strength of each individual tree in the forest. A tree with a low error rate is a
strong classifier. Increasing the strength of the individual
trees decreases the forest error rate.” [11]. Using a random forest model allows us to get out-of-bag (OOB) estimates which are akin to cross-validation and are useful
for estimating the performance of models created using
small datasets.
Using Rajarshi Guha’s CDK Descriptor Calculator (v
1.4.6) [12], we calculated the CDK [13–15] descriptors
for all the compounds in our refined data file, selecting
the option to add explicit hydrogens. Once descriptors
were calculated, we deleted all columns that had a zero
standard deviation. Additional feature selection was performed by removing columns that were highly correlated
(0.9 and above). Two compounds were removed as they
had several “NA” values across multiple descriptors. This
left us with a dataset of 259 1-octanol solubility values
with 86 CDK descriptors.
The dataset was then split randomly into training and
test sets (75:25). Using the random forest model package (v 4.6-10) in R (v 3.1.2), we created a random forest

model using our training set data. This model had an
OOB R2 value of 0.63 and an OOB MSE of 0.38. This
model was then used to predict the 1-octanol solubilities
of the compounds in the test-set resulting in and R2 value
of 0.54 and a MSE of 0.44, see Fig.  5. The performance
statistics obtained when using the model to predict testset solubilities are comparable to the OOB values. The
fact that they are slightly smaller may be an artifact of the
relatively small sizes of the training and test sets and the
fact that we decided to doing a single taining-set/test-set
split rather than use cross-validation.
One of the goals of our research was to provide for the
community a useful web application that can be used to
predict 1-octanol solubilities directly from structure. To
accomplish this, we created a random forest model using
the entire dataset. This model has an OOB R2 value of
0.66 and an OOB MSE of 0.34.
The following descriptors were identified as important:
ALogP, XLogP, TopoPSA, nAtomP, MDEC.23, khs.aaCH,
and nHBAcc, see Fig. 6, which correspond to two models
for LogP, the predicted topological polar surface area, the
number of atoms in the longest pi chain, the MDE topological descriptor, a Kier and Hall smarts descriptor, and
the number of hydrogen bond acceptors respectively. It

is not surprising that both ALogP and XLogP would be
important in predicting 1-octanol solubility, though one
would have assumed that one of these descriptors would
have been removed during feature selection as being
highly correlated with the other. Analyzing the correlation between these two descriptors, we see that they are
correlated at 0.83 and they both survived as are cutoff
was at 0.90. This further confirms the problems with current Open LogP descriptors implemented in the CDK
[16].
We tried several other models using the same training
set/test set split as above with no improvement in performance. A linear model (lm) using all 86 CDK descriptors
had an R2 value of 0.24 and MSE of 0.88; A tuned (using
tenfold cross validation) support vector machine (epsilon  =  0.3, cost  =  4.3) had an R2 value of 0.35 and MSE
of 0.38; and an optimized (using the train command in
the caret package) artificial neural network model (nnet)
had an R2 value of 0.36 and MSE of 0.74. Thus the random forest model seems the best model for the current
dataset.
Previously published models only report the training
set statistics, so in order to directly compare our model
with previous models we used our full random forest

model to predict the solubilities of the entire dataset,
see Fig.  7. For the training set, the model has an R2
value of 0.94 and a MSE of 0.06. Abraham and Acree’s
recommended Eq.  (3), if all necessary descriptors
are available, for estimations of log Soct has a training
set R2 value of 0.83 [5] which is lower than our value.
Our model also does not require a measured melting
point. This makes our model, even with the modest
OOB R2 value of 0.66, superior to all others previously
published.
In general, we expect the performance of our model to
be better for compounds similar to those in the training
set, apart from obvious outliers. However, there was no
statistically significant performance differential between
the interior and the periphery of the chemical space as
has been found previously for other properties we have
modeled using similar techniques [17]. We used the
free-to-use DMax Chemistry Assistant Software [18]
to help discover regions of the chemical space where
our random forest model performs poorly (and conversely, well). Interestingly, the only statistically noteworthy (p ~ 0.1) finding is that the model performance
is dependent upon the solubility values themselves;
with the model performing well for compounds with

solubility values over 0.01  M and performing poorly
for compounds with solubility values less than 0.01  M.
This suggests that the solubility data is comparatively
not as reliable for compounds with solubility values less
than 0.01  M and that using the model to predict solubilities of compounds that have low solubilities should
be done with caution. No other statistically significant
or noteworthy differences in model performance were
found based on both physical properties and structure/
scaffold.
The data collection, curation, and modeling were all
performed under Open Notebook Science (ONS) conditions. Additional modeling details, including our R code,
can be found on the Open Notebook page [19]. We have
deployed our model as a Shiny application [20].

Conclusions
We have developed a random forest model for 1-octanol
solubility that has an OOB R2 value of 0.66 and an average absolute error of 0.34 that performs better than any
other currently published model. Our model makes
1-octanol solubility predictions directly from structure without having to know the solute’s melting point
or aqueous solubility. This makes our model the leading

open model for predicting 1-octanol solubilities for a
variety of applications.
