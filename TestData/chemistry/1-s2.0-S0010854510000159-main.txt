This review touches the most common instances where non-innocent (“suspect”) behaviour of redoxactive ligands, either substrates or supporting components, is observed in a biochemical context.
These ligands include the O2 /O2 • − /O2 2− , NO+ /NO• /NO− , o-quinone/o-semiquinone/catecholate and tyrosyl/tyrosinate redox systems, the tetrapyrrole (porphyrinic) ligands, the pterins and ﬂavins, and the
dithiolene/ene-dithiolate ligands in molybdo- and tungstopterin. These non-innocent ligands are discussed in their interaction with biological iron, copper, manganese, molybdenum or tungsten centers.

1. Introduction: non-innocent ligand behaviour within the
oxidation state concept
Although the oxidation state concept, so widely used in inorganic chemistry as illustrated by textbooks [1], is periodically
criticized [2] because of its obvious limitations in certain areas
such as organometallic chemistry, its usefulness in establishing
“physical oxidation states” [3] is never seriously disputed. Among
the consequences from this concept in the ﬁeld of coordination
chemistry is the occurrence of situations, in which the assignment of oxidation states is not a priori obvious, because the ligands
can also undergo electron transfer and thus “ligand oxidation
state” changes. Such ligands, e.g. O2 /O2 •− /O2 2− or NO+ /NO• /NO− ,
were classiﬁed by Jørgensen [4] as “suspect” (or “non-innocent”

or “guilty” [4]), in contrast to “innocent”, unequivocally chargedeﬁned ligands such as H2 O, NH3 or Cl− [5]. Based on experience in
the usage of such wording, Ward and McCleverty have more precisely deﬁned a non-innocent behaviour of “ambi-valent” ligands
[6] because this response may depend on the metal partner. Since
redox-active ligands changing their charge by just one elementary
unit will necessarily form radical species, the increasingly recognized signiﬁcance of radical ligands [7] in biochemistry [8–10] and
elsewhere [11] has contributed to the renewed interest in the concept of “non-innocence” [12]. It goes without saying that there are
many examples of non-innocently behaving ligands without any
bioinorganic [13] relevance, Scheme 1 shows a few such redoxactive metal-binding systems [14–16]. ␣-Diimines were among the
earliest [17] but not always clearly recognized examples [18].
The alternative coordination situation between a redox-active
transition metal My/y+1 and a non-innocent ligand NILx/x−1 can
imply either a resonance situation (1) with delocalized valences
in a single minimum or an equilibrium (2) between two

Electroactive and thus non-innocently behaving ligands occur
not infrequently in bioinorganic chemistry [21], either as substrates (e.g. O2 , NO, quinones) or as supporting and therefore
property-modifying redox-active cofactor ligands (porphyrins,
quinones, dithiolate arrangements). This overview will also show
that there are several documented cases where several different
non-innocent ligands interact and cooperate synergistically with
the redox-active metal ion (see Section 9).
2. The classical case of O2 /O2 •− /O2 2− as non-innocently
behaving ligands
Dioxygen, superoxide (hyperoxide radical anion), and peroxide have long been recognized as part of a non-innocent ligand
series [22]. The early established differences between the triplet
neutral species O2 , the doublet intermediate O2 •− , and the diamagnetic but still only metastable O2 2− could not prevent that
a ﬁerce and still ongoing debate [23,24] evolved on the proper
description of the oxymyoglobin (and oxyhemoglobin) structure
(Scheme 2).
(The formulae used in Scheme 2 and in the following are reduced
to a minimum in order to focus on the interaction between the
metal(s) and non-innocent ligand(s). The innocent co-ligands such
as most amino acid residues from protein side chains or (in some

Scheme 2.

instances) tetrapyrrole macrocycles are not drawn although they
contribute to the electronic properties of the metal centers.)
A recent overview describing this dispute and providing new
calculation results [24] appears to show a preference for the Weiss
formulation which would reveal the dioxygen ligand as behaving
non-innocently, i.e. undergoing electron transfer in this reversible
reaction.
The other oxygen transport proteins with non-heme containing
dinuclear iron (hemerythrin [25]) or copper centers (hemocyanin
[26]) exhibit a two-electron shift (3) between the differently coordinated [13] O2 /O2 2− ligands and the dinuclear metal site.

Mx = FeII or CuI .
While the FeIII (O2 •− ) alternative is also discussed for intermediates in catalytic cycles of P450 monooxygenases [13,27],
a further ambivalence between superoxo [28] and peroxo ligands can be assumed for partially reduced reactive species
FeIII (O2 2− )/FeII (O2 •− ) in such cycles.
The dioxygen non-innocent ligand system is distinguished by
its capability to function beyond the (O2 )n states (n = 0, 1−, 2−) in
a biochemical context. Three- and four-electron reduction of O2
via O2 2− by an oxidizable metal results in O–O bond cleavage to
produce oxyl/hydroxyl (O•− /• OH) radicals or oxide ions. The former
is known as Fenton chemistry [29], mostly formulated as
Mn + H2 O2 → Mn+1 (OH) + • OH

M = Fe and n = +II, or Cu and n = +I while the latter may be represented by the alternative (5) for dicopper/dioxygen interaction
[30].

3. The NO+ /NO• /NO− ligand system: a late addition to
biorelevant non-innocent ligands
The seminal discovery [31] of the extensive role of NO in
biochemical information transfer [32] has revived a part of coordination chemistry [33] that was fascinating but lay dormant for some
time. Immediately, the non-innocent ligand potential of the system nitrosyl cation/nitric oxide radical/nitroxide anion [33,34] was
remembered and assumed to be a crucial factor for the in vivo activity of “NO” [32]. In fact, Jørgensen had identiﬁed NO as “the simplest
case of a suspect ligand” [4]. In the course of more recent investiga-

tions there was also a reappraisal of classical but never questioned
assignments (e.g. of the brown ring species in the classical nitrate
test as FeIII (NO− ) and not as FeI (NO+ ) [35]) and a reinvestigation of
well known species such as the nitroprusside ion [Fe(CN)5 (NO)]2−
by more contemporary methodology [28,36,37].
The increasingly available structural information also proved
advantageous in the analysis of bonding with non-innocent NO
because the binding of the very strong ␲ electron acceptor NO+ ,
the neutral radical NO• , or the strong electron donor NO− could be
differentiated on the basis of the M–N–O angle within the electron
pair repulsion model (Scheme 3) [34].
In addition, the established Enemark–Feltham notation {MNO}x
[34] (Scheme 3) could be used which deliberately neglected to
assign oxidation states individually to the metal or to NOn but
assumed a large degree of covalent bonding. Such concepts were
conﬁrmed later, e.g. through unexpected invariant spin distribution
in Ln Ru(NO) complexes with {RuNO}7 conﬁguration, regardless of
the ancillary ligands Ln [38].
An important question discussed mostly for heme (Feporphyrin) species involves the alternative (6) between the
formulations
FeII (NO+ ) or FeIII (NO• )

(6)

Detailed experimental and computational studies by Lenhert and
coworkers have shown that rather small energy differences may
occur between the two alternatives [39] which are further inﬂuenced by the potential of porphyrin non-innocence and of spin
crossover.
One-electron reduction would lead to the alternatives in (7)
FeI (NO+ ), FeII (NO• ) or FeIII (NO− )

(7)

for the {FeNO}7 conﬁguration which have already been mentioned
in connection with the brown ring reaction [35]. The complication
from various accessible spin states clearly adds a further dimension
here to the non-innocent ligand ambivalence, however, techniques
such as Mössbauer and EPR spectroscopy for paramagnetic species
allow to identify [FeIII (H2 O)5 (NO− )]2+ [35] and [FeII (CN)5 (NO• )]3−
[37].

4. Biochemical roles of the 1,2-dioxolenes as the
prototypical organic non-innocent ligands
(o-quinone/o-semiquinone/catecholate)
Probably the most researched non-innocent organic ligands are
those derived from the catecholate/o-quinone redox system, with
the o-semiquinone as the frequently persistent intermediate form.
The non-innocent behaviour of these excellent chelate systems
(ﬁve-membered ring formation) has been recognized, formulated
and reviewed rather early [40,41], and unusual phenomena such
as delocalized bonding [42,43] or valence tautomerism [19,20]
were described for these ligands in their ring substituted and O/NR
exchanged forms (see Schemes 4 and 5).
Biological relevance for quinones (o- and p-isomers [44]) is
obvious, given their ubiquitous role in photosynthesis [45] and
respiration [46], in many enzymatic processes [47], and in their
nutritional (antioxidants, vitamins [48]), pharmaceutical [49],
pathogenic (carcinogenesis, Parkinson’s disease) and toxicological
functions [50]. Speciﬁc non-innocent behaviour has been discussed
for iron and copper proteins: Catechol dioxygenases specializing in
intra-diol cleavage (see Scheme 6) contain single non-heme iron
centers which are assumed [51] to be chelated by the catecholate
substrates and undergo an intramolecular electron exchange process (8)
iron(III)/catecholate → iron(II)/semiquinone

which allows the binding and reductive activation of the other substrate molecule, 3 O2 .
In a similar way, Cu-dependent amine oxidases [52] contain
a single metal ion Cu2+ per subunit which may interact with
substrate-reduced multifunctional “topaquinone” (TPQ, Scheme 7),
i.e. an electron-rich aromatic compound, to produce EPRdetectable semiquinone [53] and a copper(I) center ready for O2
binding and activation. Such intramolecular electron-exchange

lignin degradation (catechol enhanced Fenton reaction) and antioxidant activity such as radical scavenging.
While the less reduced quinones do not typically form inert
coordinative bonds they may still be expected, as non-innocent
ligands, to be involved in further electron transfer activity versus
transition metals in biochemistry. o-Quinones provide a natural
chelating binding site (see Schemes 4 and 5) whereas p-quinones
may have to use additional donors for chelation [44,55].

could be reproduced spectroscopically in model systems
(Scheme 8) [54].
Comparable redox potentials of Cu0/I/II and Q0/−I/−II (Scheme 9)
are thus relevant in combination not only for materials science
(ferromagnetically coupled CuII –Q•− ) and organic synthesis (“copper catalysis”) but also in biochemistry for the biosynthesis of
neurotransmitters such as catecholamines, the biosynthesis of
pigments like melanin, the biosynthesis of cofactors (e.g. tyro-

5. Cooperation of the tyrosyl/tyrosinate redox pair with
iron, copper or manganese in metalloenzymes
The binding of deprotonated tyrosine to high-valent metals,
especially iron(III), has long been known as a source of intense
absorption in the visible region, leading to colouring of proteins
such as transferrin or purple acid phosphatases [56]. The formulation of this process (10) already points to the potential of such
a combination for electron transfer in the ground state, leading to
complexes of the neutral, oxidizing tyrosyl radical (Scheme 10).

In fact, electron exchange and the magnetic interaction of the tyrosyl radical with iron, copper and manganese has been established
in important proteins such as ribonucleotide reductase (Fe [57]),
galactose oxidase (Cu [58]), and in photosystem II of photosynthesis
(Mn [59]).
Whereas the oxidative power generated from the (Fe· · ·Fe)/O2
interaction in ribonucleotide reductase serves to convert tyrosinate
to tyrosyl on the way to radical involving ribonucleotide deoxy-

genation [57,60], the coordination of one cysteinyl-substituted,
i.e. electron-rich tyrosinate to copper allows for a combined
Cu(II)/tyrosyl action to oxidize primary alcohols to aldehydes
(Scheme 11 [58]).
The essential tyrosine/tyrosyl redox pair in photosystem II
mediates the electron ﬂow (Scheme 12) from the catalytic CaMn4
metal cluster site of water oxidation to the photoexcited special
pair at the center of the photosystem [59].
It is interesting to witness the recent surge [8,9,60] in biochemical radical chemistry which mostly involves metal activation of
non-innocent organic functions.
6. Essential non-innocence of tetrapyrrole (porphyrinic)
ligands in biochemistry
The excellent chelating coordination properties of macrocyclic
tetrapyrrole ligands such as the porphyrins [61] have sometimes
masked their great potential for non-innocent behaviour in both
directions, i.e. towards oxidation and reduction. As the standard
form of porphyrins is that of a dianionic tetradentate macrocycle
(Por2− ), the one-electron oxidized forms involve the radical anion
Por•− whereas the one-electron reduced state corresponds to a
radical trianion Por•3− (Scheme 13). While such redox states (and
beyond) of porphyrins and related ligands in their metal complexes
(e.g. metalloporphyrins) can be conveniently generated electrochemically or via suitable chemical processes [62], their occurrence
is more limited but nonetheless well documented in bioinorganic
chemistry.

One most important intermediates involves the highly oxidized
states in catalytic cycles of P-450 monooxygenation (“compound
I” [27,28,63a]) and peroxidase action (“HRP I” [63b]). In both
instances, the interaction with O2 + e− + e− (P-450) or H2 O2 (peroxidases) on heme-iron(II) results in an oxidized reactive species (11a)
and (11b) which may be best described [13,27,28,63] by an oxoferryl(IV) center [Fe O]2+ coordinated to a one-electron oxidized
porphinato ligand:
{(Por2− )FeIII }+ + O2 + 2e− + 2H+ → H2 O + {(Por•− )([FeIV O])}•+
(11a)
{(Por2− )FeIII }+ + H2 O2 → H2 O + {(Por•− )([FeIV O])}•+

Although they contain a porphinato radical anion ligand (11a) and
(11b), such species are usually referred to as “radical cations” [63a],
they have been studied at low temperatures and have characteristical absorption [27,63].
In contrast, the magnesium(II) complexes of certain chlorins
known as chlorophylls can serve as primary electron acceptors in
photosystem I of photosynthesis whereby the photoproduced electron from charge separation within the “special pair” is added by
the macrocyclic ␲ system to convert it from a dianion to a paramagnetic, EPR-detectable trianion [64a].

(12)

Although the lifetime of this intermediate is only in the order of
a few picoseconds in the photosynthetic process [64], its occurrence is crucial for the (irreversible) separation of charges within
the photosynthetic membrane.

7. Potential for non-innocent ligation by pterins and ﬂavins
Pterins and ﬂavins are redox-active cofactors in their own right
[65,66] which can even function as O2 activating species in enzymes
without direct support by metal centers [66,67].
Their complex heteroatom-rich ␲ systems do not only allow
for multiple H-bonding and a ␲/␲ interaction potential, they also
facilitate multiple reversible electron transfer and permit metal
coordination, preferentially at the O4-N5 chelating site [68] (see
Scheme 14).
The intrinsic redox reactivity of ﬂavins involves two frequently separated one-electron transfer steps with an aromatic
oxidized form, a ﬂavosemiquinone intermediate, and a formally
antiaromatic (8 ␲ electron) “ﬂavohydroquinone” state [66,69]
(Scheme 15).

Scheme 16.

1586

W. Kaim, B. Schwederski / Coordination Chemistry Reviews 254 (2010) 1580–1588

Scheme 17.

Biochemically useful switching between sequential 1e transfers and one 2e transfer appears to be possible by environmental
control, including structural effects [66,69].
The pterin redox system [65,70] is different because it involves
a tetrahydro state and several dihydro species (Scheme 16) while
odd-electron intermediates seem to be less important.
The proven enhancement [68,71,72] of redox reactivity of
pterins and ﬂavins after metal ion binding has initiated speculation on such mechanisms in biochemical processes. However,
electron exchange between metal functions and ﬂavin or pterin
cofactors in enzymes does not usually require direct coordination,
it can make use of the suitability of proteins for electron transfer
mediation.
A special case, however, is the dithiolene containing pyranopterin system (Scheme 19 [70,73]) which combines pterin redox
chemistry, pyran ring opening potential, and the speciﬁc noninnocent ligand potential of the dithiolene/ene-dithiolate function
(Scheme 17).

Scheme 19.

8. Non-innocent dithiolene/ene-dithiolate ligands in
molybdo- and tungstopterin
As outlined in detail in this volume, the dithiolenes constitute
a prototypical class of non-innocently behaving ligands, especially towards “soft” transition metal centers [4,74]. Similarly as in
diimino-o-quinone compounds of ruthenium [43,75], these species
exhibit a high degree of covalent bonding with extensively delocalized electrons and corresponding difﬁculties to apply conventional
oxidation state nomenclature.
Formally, however, the ␣-dithiolenes ﬁt right into the general
scheme (Scheme 18) of chelating non-innocent ligands.
The biochemically active molybdopterin or tungstopterin
(Scheme 19) structures include a substrate binding Mo or W center
with oxo and/or other donor ligands, bound in a classical fashion to
one or two ene-dithiolate chelates the back of which is connected
to the pyran ring of a tricyclic “pyranopterin” heterocycle [73,76].

Scheme 20.

While the function potential of pterins is obvious (Scheme 16)
and the dithiolene/ene-dithiolate non-innocent ligand interacting
with MIV to MVI species is well understood [77], there is a discussion how the facile pyran ring opening can affect the pterin
oxidation state and allow the pterin redox system to interact with
the substrate-converting metal-dithiolene center during the enzymatic process [70].

9. Summary and perspective
Apart from the more obvious advantages from non-innocence,
e.g. lowered reorganization energy for electron transfer through
delocalization or spin crossover, the cooperation [21] between two
different non-innocent ligands occurs in several bioinorganic conﬁgurations (Scheme 20) with the beneﬁt of multifunctionality such
as separated but communicating electron transfer and reaction centers.
Functional modeling of such combinations is also possible, e.g.
by assembling NO together with porphyrin or quinonoid ligands at
redox-active ruthenium [78].
While this rather brief overview has focussed on the more
obvious instances of non-innocent ligand behaviour in bioinorganic chemistry, there may be hidden such situations which could
involve, e.g. cysteinato ligands, Cys− , acting more as cysteinyl radicals, Cys• : (Cys− )Mn /(Cys• )Mn−1 . Even the humble oxide, O2− , may
thus acquire signiﬁcant oxyl (O•− ) character, as assumed for the
highly oxidized intermediates (13) of oxoferryl-heme containing
P-450 systems:

Axial ligation by ␴ and ␲ electron-rich cysteinate (Scheme 21),
another potentially suspect ligand as indicated above, seems to
favour the ﬁrst alternative which then causes the H abstraction/OH
rebound sequence assumed for the P-450 productive mechanism
[27,63a].
